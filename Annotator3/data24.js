But, since you say this book changed your perspective, I'm concluding that you live somewhere where the approach you suggest is not the norm. I am suggesting that there are good reasons for people who live in places where the convention is to talk to someone for a while before proposing sex to follow that convention. Of course, even in such places, there are sub-cultures where the norms vary, such as within the BDSM community. As someone else recommended, that might be a good place to look if you want a place where people are likely to respond positively to the direct approach you want to take.\n\nAs to whether it can be beneficial to not be immediately honest, I think it can. Many people do not immediately know if they want to have sex with another person. They need to talk to that person for a while first. It's difficult to have that kind of conversation if one person has already opened with \"I am confident that we shall exchange orgasms in the future.\" By delaying your announcement of your intentions a bit, you are being courteous to people who need a bit of time to decide. Talking to someone first gives you the opportunity to potentially have sex with lots of people who would say no if you asked about sex immediately, because they don't want to agree to sex before they've seen what the person is like in conversation. \n\nYou may, of course, not be interested in sex with people like that. Perhaps you are a very visual person and want to have sex only with other people whose arousal is totally visually based, people who don't need conversation to determine if they want to have sex. But plenty of other people don't care that much about their partner's opinion on this matter. So they follow the course that gives them access to the greatest number of possible sex partners--normal conversation first, declaration of desire for sex later."}, {"id": "2n4nxy", "body": "Okay I did a search on this reddit and was surprised this issue has not been debated yet.\n\nAnyways: My inspiration for holding this opinion came from this man's [book](http://www.datingskillsreview.com/mode-one-alan-roger-currie/), which changed my world view entirely about my anecdotal experiences in regards to approaching women.\n\nNow when discussing about this book to my peers or the ideas about them, I have had a 50/50 on the topic who agree and disagree.

I did not say it was the only way just what I consider as the \"best\" as in fastest. Now of course I could make a girl get wet by just writing up something erotic as well or other tactics that relate back to a lady's sexual desires in terms of fantasies.

If you only want sex go mode one on it. If you only want a relationship than go mode one on it too. If you only want marriage than PLEASE GO mode one on that with your first interaction.\n\nNow in regards to not getting every women by being mode one well MystK....that's the whole point! Mode one is a process of elimination approach that allows men to deal with women who would normally manipulate dudes or use sex as a tool to get what they want out of guys. In addition mode one forces those women who pretend to criticize men for being dogs to show their true colors.\n\nSo, if you are thinking mode one is meant to get ALL women then you sir are misinformed. Mode one is meant to be honest and cut away from the constant miscommunication that occurs within relationships.\n\n\n&gt;Also, I might have wanted that then, but not now. People change, and setting up clear boundaries of what the relationship is and isn't will just set up a roadblock for you in the future.\n\n\nI am quite aware people change and that's the beauty of mode one for guys: this is an approach based upon what a man HONESTLY wants with women! If you do not honestly want sex and would prefer to be in a relationship or marriage with a woman than just say it before you mislead her into thinking other wise. There might be a road block later only if things change within the relationship. However, if you are honest that your intentions have changed just let the lady know and if she's not interested than it is on you to move on. This approach is not about pleasing others, it's about being honest towards yourself. \n\nEdit: I know for myself that MY relationships with women will change if I am sexually engaged with them after a numerous amounts of times since I am no longer just interested in their company for sex, but also see them in relationship based upon their personality. Attraction for me only starts physically, but builds into a relationship or possibly marriage later.

The most common empirical evidence for a theory employed in teaching is [Pavlov's dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning).

Yes, talking about rape is triggering and difficult for me no matter the situation, but in a constructive situation it is often necessary and even cathartic.

Go for an ignorance prior (1/2 chance for, 1/2 chance again) add in all the conjunctions as probability, and any rationalist will quickly arrive at new very low priors.\n\nThis kind of probability guessing is new to me, as you can tell, but if I understand correctly -- priors are not odds, just numbers of options. In an ignorance prior, the fact that there are two choices does not make the odds 50/50, it just means there are two possibilities. Right? You wouldn't say I had a 50/50 chance of living past the age of 5 just because there are two choices, I do and I don't, right? Therefore, if the priors for psi phenomena are low, doesn't that just mean there are a lot of other options? And if none of those options fit the data, aren't they all irrelevant, no matter how many there are compared to the one for psi phenomena?\n\n&gt;I think you overestimate how contentious an issue this is. Abortion is contentious. The death penalty is contentious. This is not.\n\nI think you underestimate how contentious this issue is. Anyone who has spent any amount of time berating people for believing in ESP or declaring that it's wrong has an emotional investment in that viewpoint. Not to mention atheist materialists who have as much attachment to scientific materialism as religious fundamentalists have in creationism. There would be upheavals if mainstream science suddenly accepted psi phenomena. That doesn't necessarily mean they will lose their head over it and become outraged like in the abortion debate (though many do), but it *does* mean that there are significant factors beyond \"lack of evidence\" contributing to the resistance to this idea. The widespread hostility to the idea of psi phenomena (which you can see throughout this thread) is evidence of the threat that the mainstream scientific community perceives it to be.\n\n\n&gt;I think everyone would be absolutely ecstatic about psychic powers being real. I certainly would be. If we could study it, and then amplify it, we would be pretty friggen close to worldwide-auto-empathy. That'd be great, but I don't think it's true.\n\nIn my experience it was like developing a sensitive palate or a sensitive musical ear. It needed conscious attention to \"tune into,\" but once the effort was invested it started to show up. Some people are born with this sensitivity, some work to develop it, and some never experience it, often because they don't try. \n\nI appreciate the cordiality with which you're conducting this discussion and I don't want to interrupt that, but given 1) widespread anecdotal evidence for psi phenomena, 2) representation of psi phenomena and explanations of its \"mechanisms\" in virtually all spiritual traditions, and now 3) the scientific evidence for psi phenomena, to claim you would be ecstatic about psychic powers being real without venturing to believe in them seems disingenuous. \n\nSecondly, they may not live up to their cliches -- they may not be ever-present \"powers\" that can be used completely at will and completely predictably like Superman's x-ray vision -- but that doesn't necessarily mean they don't exist, and that we can't benefit from them. To expect psi phenomena to live up to those cliches and then declare them nonexistent when they don't, as if the only two options are \"full-blown superhumanity\" and \"nothing\" is a common straw man.\n\n&gt;It... kind of does. The probability that someone says something false is correlated with their attachment to the idea.\n\nI'm glad you agree then, I make the psychological argument often (as that's more my field) but wanted to rely more on hard evidence for the sake of this CMV.\n\n&gt;Probability is not in any way based on physics....\n\nBut aren't the assumptions about what's probable based in physics? For instance, after doing the \"ignorance prior,\" the conjunctions you'd have to deal with are \"probability that there is a physical force connecting brains that has not been observed\" or something like that. Or am I misunderstanding?\n\n&gt;The conjunction fallacy is the mathematical lead into Ockham's razor.\n&gt;In order to make a consistent world with \"psi,\" you need to make a ton of assumptions, all of which lower the probability that it's true.\n&gt;For example, in order to make, say, telepathy logically consistent. You would have to answer the following questions (among others).\n&gt;1) How does a brain take the thought, and turn it into message pattern?\n&gt;2) How does one brain initiate the sending of the message (\"willing it\") doesn't cut it.\n&gt;3) How does a send a message to another brain without using some wavelength (sound, light, radio, x-ray)?\n&gt;4) How does the signal (or whatever it is) change the brain pattern of the receiving person, allowing a person to \"hear\" it in their mind.\"\n\nIf consciousness is connected, then \"willing it\" *does* cut it. If, as the sages say, we are all one consciousness, then our wills are intertwined and the thoughts that occur to one could as easily occur to another regardless of distance. This is the kind of materialistic assumption that makes prior probabilities irrelevant. \n\nAnother is the equivocation of the mind with the brain. Perhaps the brain *doesn't* take a thought and turn it into a message pattern (but while we're at it, how does a brain take an electrochemical impulse and turn it into thought-words? We don't know, but we don't doubt that it happens).\n\nPerhaps the quantum vacuum out of which physical phenomena arise connects minds in a way that scientists haven't observed, and therefore psychic messages can travel without a physical medium.\n\nI don't think it would be too difficult to make telepathy logically consistent provided we allowed some theoretical physics in.\n\n\n&gt;Although it doesn't seem so bad, number 4 is especially tricky. With a little knowledge of the brain, you learn that brains aren't all configured the same way. Every brain figures out how to work independently of other brains, and all kind of come up with their own way of thinking. It isn't like a computer, where \"knowledge\" transfer is easy (because they're all based on the same code.\n\nBrains may be configured differently, but the experience of consciousness is without inherent qualities and is the same for everyone. If there was some quality in consciousness, it couldn't be the backdrop against which everything else is registered; it has to be blank. People may organize input differently -- different personalities, etc. -- but the experience of being able to experience is universal.\n\nThe assumption that the mind comes from the brain and that the brain is like a computer are all scientifically convenient ways of avoiding the possibiliy that psi phenomena *are* logically consistent with what we know about the world and about how things work.\n\n&gt;It's actually more like taking written text, and teaching a machine to read it optically (through a camera). It's possible, but it takes a ton of programming, and a ton of human intelligence (through code) to get it to work.\n\nI see it as more like the capacity to hear one second of a song you've never heard before and know that it's by your favorite band. Perhaps there is a unique harmonic signature to any given thought or emotion (in consciousness, or in the quantum vacuum), and in order to \"transmit\" this it is only necessary that the other person be capable of resonating with it. \n\n&gt;Yes, you can come up with a system that works with telepathy. But it is riddled with assumptions, assumptions that all contribute to making it less and less probable.\n\nUnless you're extremely attached to a materialist view in which the brain equals the mind and consciousness is a local product of the brain, I think you'll find not many assumptions are needed.\n\n&gt;I don't trust 'otherwise' (for a variety of reasons that I'll go into if you're really curious), but in any case, defying explanation forms a question (How does this happen), but doesn't create an answer.\n\nIt's fine not to trust \"otherwise\" as definitive, but to dismiss it as evidence doesn't seem to make sense. You claim that if people behaved as if psi phenomena were real, then you'd be a fool not to believe it. Since people sometimes *do* behave that way -- for instance, by taking action based on a clairvoyant intuition of some kind and being rewarded for it -- shouldn't that factor into your assessment of behavior?\n\n&gt;When there's a mechanism that can be shown to be probable, I'd imagine.\n\nTheres no known mechanism for why quantum wavefunctions collapse, and yet we accept that they do. Why must we find a mechanism for a phenomenon before admitting the phenomenon is real? I think this is a cop-out. \n\nThe simpler explanation is that psi phenomena are real. That psi phenomena are *not* real would require many improbable assumptions:\n\n- millions of people are wrong about very clear and wakeful perceptions, even though those perceptions are often helpful, accurate, uncannily relevant, and often influenced by willful choice\n\n- the mind is confined to the brain, consciousness is a local phenomenon, and there is some physical means by which electrochemical signals become qualia\n\n- psi research produced false results at odds of 1 in 10 million\n"}, {"id": "cma6nlh", "body": "&gt;So how does this one scientist, who doesn't study psi phenomena, know psi phenomena don't exist?\n\nIt's clear from context that he is using \"know\" in the colloquial manner.

They concluded that \"Until remote viewing can be confirmed in conditions which prevent sensory cueing the conclusions of Targ and Puthoff remain an unsubstantiated hypothesis.\"[38] The researchers said that Targ and Puthoff had not provided unpublished transcripts when requested, but that after obtaining them from a judge in the study they were able to find \"a wealth of cues.\"[39]\n\n&gt;Simon Hoggart and Mike Hutchinson described Targ as willing to believe and overly credulous.[40] A 1988 report by the United States National Research Council (NRC) concluded, \"there should remain little doubt that the Targ-Puthoff studies are fatally flawed\".[41]\n\n&gt;Remote viewing was popularized in the 1990s upon the declassification of certain documents related to the Stargate Project, a $20 million research program that had started in 1975 and was sponsored by the U.S. government, in an attempt to determine any potential military application of psychic phenomena. The program was terminated in 1995 after it failed to produce any useful intelligence information. David Goslin, of the American Institutes for Research said, \"There's no documented evidence it had any value to the intelligence community\".[42]\n\n&gt;A variety of scientific studies of remote viewing have been conducted. Some earlier, less sophisticated experiments produced positive results but they had invalidating flaws.[36] None of the more recent experiments have shown positive results when conducted under properly controlled conditions.[29][42][43] This lack of successful experiments has led the mainstream scientific community to reject remote viewing, based upon the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain remote viewing, and the lack of experimental techniques which can provide reliably positive results.[37]\n\n&gt;Science writers including Gary Bennett, Martin Gardner, Michael Shermer and professor of neurology Terence Hines describe the topic of remote viewing as pseudoscience.[3][44][45][46]\n\n"}, {"id": "cma67v6", "body": "Sounds good!\n\n It's also worth noting that the word \"pseudoscience\" is thrown around a lot to dismiss genuinely scientific ideas that conflict with the philosophy of materialism that pervades mainstream science.\n\nWhich is the study you read?

Most lawsuits I've heard of, when they're won, require payment estimated to equal the losses that occurred.\n\nIf there was a loss of life, we have laws for punishing that, too.

To expand:\n\n**Skilled trade jobs are hard, physical work**: I come from a family of roofers, and live in an area that has been experiencing constant new home construction since the early '90s. My father was a satellite TV installer back when a satellite dish would take up most of your back yard, and a TV/telephone installer after that. Most of my (older) family members have had major knee, back, and hip surgeries in their 40s and 50s, and many have sustained life-altering or career-ending injuries. Physically, I would *never* have been able to pursue a career in the 'family business' (I'm a skinny dude), and I think it's better to work 40 years and retire with your body mostly intact than work 25-30 years and retire because you've destroyed your body and physically can't work any more. \n\n**It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'**. I'm sure many people don't care how society views their career, and would laugh in the face of someone who denigrates their job while making substantially less money. That said: there will always be *some* people who look down on the 'dirty jobs', and some people who avoid those jobs because of it. I don't think income level alone will be enough to legitimize certain careers at certain levels of society. I'm not saying it's right: I'm saying it's a reality. Some people will always balk at marrying a sewage technician, even if that sewage technician is making +$100k.\n\n**(The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce**. We will always need contractors, plumbers, electricians, and welders; but we only need so many. In the '70s, everyone was advising young people to go into medicine. In the '80s, everyone was advising young people to go into law. In the '90s, everyone was advising young people to go into technology and computers. Look at the job prospects of those fields today. Medicine is still well-paid, but only because it takes a decade (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to become a doctor. Starting lawyers are earning ~$40k, after accruing +$100k in law school debt. Information Technology grads have a higher unemployment rate than Theater or English majors. **Any field that experiences a rapid influx of credentialed professionals suffers from depressed wages and high unemployment.** If young people take the oft-proffered advice and enter the skilled trades: their experience is going to be worse. It takes much less time, money, and (please don't be mad at me for saying so) intellectual rigor to become certified as a skilled tradesman than it does to become a doctor, lawyer, or computer scientist. By the same token ...\n\n**Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing**. The trajectory of unions in the US has been sad and getting sadder for decades. Unions are the weakest today that they've been since before the Gilded Age. An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen, desperate for work in an increasingly saturated market, will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases, wages will fall. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states, unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no longer provide a middle-class income. \n\n**A college degree is still a worthwhile investment**. Statistically, a college degree is worth somewhere between $800k to $1.2m over the course of a working career. Even if a student takes out $32k in loans (the average for a college graduate), that investment returns many, many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a good investment to me. \n\nToday, as it stands, few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they don't garner the level of social respect that the so-called 'white collar' careers attain. For the people who still choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their pay and working conditions. Further, it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades (because of family background, physical prowess, and/or difficulty with traditional education) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who wouldn't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree (which would have been a better investment) to enter a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. \n\nSkilled tradesmen are benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let's allow them to keep that scarcity, encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree, and encourage everyone to pursue the field that best suits their abilities: not the one that will earn the most money. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You don't just pick up a soldering iron and call yourself an electrician, it takes 4-5 Years of trade school and on the job learning to become one. It is a knowledge based profession, same as anything done at uni. This is why there is a limit on the amount produced each year: certification restrictions must be met, and an individual can't practice without them because he can't get insurance. No different to an engineer. An elec engineer and an elec project manager (senior electrician who overseas a project) have jobs of equal gravity and importance to getting a building made, they just sit on opposite sides of the process. Both are necessary, and cannot, legally or by training, do each other's jobs. In fact it's easier to outsource the engineers role to India, since they are not as necessary on site, and their work can be done in an office in a different country, for 1/4 the price\n\n"}, {"id": "cm9kruy", "body": "&gt;  Those are jobs that will be needed, in quantity for awhile, everywhere.\n\nTotally agree.

In other words, it\u2019s not attending college that makes someone more likely to be employable or earn a higher wage; it\u2019s the characteristics of people who pursue higher education that allows them to succeed.\n\nLiterally the next paragraph talks about how the college isn't definitely the reason for that wage difference.

My friend's dad was in construction: now he's in building cabinets and bookshelves."}, {"id": "2n1jje", "body": "From Mike Rowe's recent AMA to posts on /r/personalfinance, I see more and more redditors advising their peers to forego college and pursue a certification in a trade. I think this is generally bad advice: not because I think that *no one* should go into the skilled trades, but because 1.) I think most people aren't cut out for a trade career, and 2.) the stable income one can earn as a skilled tradesman is maintained by the scarcity of skilled tradesmen. To expand:\n\n**Skilled trade jobs are hard, physical work**: I come from a family of roofers, and live in an area that has been experiencing constant new home construction since the early '90s. My father was a satellite TV installer back when a satellite dish would take up most of your back yard, and a TV/telephone installer after that. Most of my (older) family members have had major knee, back, and hip surgeries in their 40s and 50s, and many have sustained life-altering or career-ending injuries. Physically, I would *never* have been able to pursue a career in the 'family business' (I'm a skinny dude), and I think it's better to work 40 years and retire with your body mostly intact than work 25-30 years and retire because you've destroyed your body and physically can't work any more. \n\n**It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'**. I'm sure many people don't care how society views their career, and would laugh in the face of someone who denigrates their job while making substantially less money. That said: there will always be *some* people who look down on the 'dirty jobs', and some people who avoid those jobs because of it. I don't think income level alone will be enough to legitimize certain careers at certain levels of society. I'm not saying it's right: I'm saying it's a reality. Some people will always balk at marrying a sewage technician, even if that sewage technician is making +$100k.\n\n**(The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce**. We will always need contractors, plumbers, electricians, and welders; but we only need so many. In the '70s, everyone was advising young people to go into medicine. In the '80s, everyone was advising young people to go into law. In the '90s, everyone was advising young people to go into technology and computers. Look at the job prospects of those fields today. Medicine is still well-paid, but only because it takes a decade (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to become a doctor. Starting lawyers are earning ~$40k, after accruing +$100k in law school debt. Information Technology grads have a higher unemployment rate than Theater or English majors. **Any field that experiences a rapid influx of credentialed professionals suffers from depressed wages and high unemployment.** If young people take the oft-proffered advice and enter the skilled trades: their experience is going to be worse. It takes much less time, money, and (please don't be mad at me for saying so) intellectual rigor to become certified as a skilled tradesman than it does to become a doctor, lawyer, or computer scientist. By the same token ...\n\n**Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing**. The trajectory of unions in the US has been sad and getting sadder for decades. Unions are the weakest today that they've been since before the Gilded Age. An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen, desperate for work in an increasingly saturated market, will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases, wages will fall. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states, unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no longer provide a middle-class income. \n\n**A college degree is still a worthwhile investment**. Statistically, a college degree is worth somewhere between $800k to $1.2m over the course of a working career. Even if a student takes out $32k in loans (the average for a college graduate), that investment returns many, many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a good investment to me. \n\nToday, as it stands, few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they don't garner the level of social respect that the so-called 'white collar' careers attain. For the people who still choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their pay and working conditions. Further, it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades (because of family background, physical prowess, and/or difficulty with traditional education) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who wouldn't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree (which would have been a better investment) to enter a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. \n\nSkilled tradesmen are benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let's allow them to keep that scarcity, encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree, and encourage everyone to pursue the field that best suits their abilities: not the one that will earn the most money. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I was an excellent student all through school, on track for college prep, but made the conscious decision to attend a vo-tech high school and it was hands-down the best life investment I ever made. \n\nFirst, I knew there was no way I could pay for college and I didn't want to go the route of student loans. \n\nSecond, I had several strong interests, but no single one outweighed another enough to decide on a discrete course of study.\n\nThird, I knew that once I turned 18, I'd have zero familial or financial support. I needed a job that would give me a living wage from day 1. \n\nI worked in the trade for five years post high school, earned enough to not only support myself, but to also build up some savings to cushion the blow when I decided to finally go to college. \n\nFlash forward two decades and both my trade license and my degree have provided (and will continue to provide) an above-average wage. However, the trade license has resulted in more interviews and more successful positions gained, *even though the trade is hardly relevant to my degree.* Interviewers and employers are not only intrigued by it, but they also assume I'm at least skilled enough to be successful at something, whereas my degree simply says I took four years of classes.\n\nTrades will always be needed. You can't replace a plumber with a computer. A robot isn't going to weld a remote pipeline. It'll be a long time before roofs are repaired via drone. Yes, trades are hard work and yes, they're hard on your body but so is sitting at a desk 8 to 10 hours a day. \n\nAnd there's no rule that says you can't retire from that trade once you've built up enough money to do something else.

I think most people aren't cut out for a trade career, and 2.) the stable income one can earn as a skilled tradesman is maintained by the scarcity of skilled tradesmen. To expand:\n\n**Skilled trade jobs are hard, physical work**: I come from a family of roofers, and live in an area that has been experiencing constant new home construction since the early '90s. My father was a satellite TV installer back when a satellite dish would take up most of your back yard, and a TV/telephone installer after that. Most of my (older) family members have had major knee, back, and hip surgeries in their 40s and 50s, and many have sustained life-altering or career-ending injuries. Physically, I would *never* have been able to pursue a career in the 'family business' (I'm a skinny dude), and I think it's better to work 40 years and retire with your body mostly intact than work 25-30 years and retire because you've destroyed your body and physically can't work any more. \n\n**It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'**. I'm sure many people don't care how society views their career, and would laugh in the face of someone who denigrates their job while making substantially less money. That said: there will always be *some* people who look down on the 'dirty jobs', and some people who avoid those jobs because of it. I don't think income level alone will be enough to legitimize certain careers at certain levels of society. I'm not saying it's right: I'm saying it's a reality. Some people will always balk at marrying a sewage technician, even if that sewage technician is making +$100k.\n\n**(The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce**. We will always need contractors, plumbers, electricians, and welders; but we only need so many. In the '70s, everyone was advising young people to go into medicine. In the '80s, everyone was advising young people to go into law. In the '90s, everyone was advising young people to go into technology and computers. Look at the job prospects of those fields today. Medicine is still well-paid, but only because it takes a decade (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to become a doctor. Starting lawyers are earning ~$40k, after accruing +$100k in law school debt. Information Technology grads have a higher unemployment rate than Theater or English majors. **Any field that experiences a rapid influx of credentialed professionals suffers from depressed wages and high unemployment.** If young people take the oft-proffered advice and enter the skilled trades: their experience is going to be worse. It takes much less time, money, and (please don't be mad at me for saying so) intellectual rigor to become certified as a skilled tradesman than it does to become a doctor, lawyer, or computer scientist. By the same token ...\n\n**Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing**. The trajectory of unions in the US has been sad and getting sadder for decades. Unions are the weakest today that they've been since before the Gilded Age. An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen, desperate for work in an increasingly saturated market, will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases, wages will fall. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states, unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no longer provide a middle-class income. \n\n**A college degree is still a worthwhile investment**. Statistically, a college degree is worth somewhere between $800k to $1.2m over the course of a working career. Even if a student takes out $32k in loans (the average for a college graduate), that investment returns many, many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a good investment to me. \n\nToday, as it stands, few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they don't garner the level of social respect that the so-called 'white collar' careers attain. For the people who still choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their pay and working conditions. Further, it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades (because of family background, physical prowess, and/or difficulty with traditional education) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who wouldn't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree (which would have been a better investment) to enter a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. \n\nSkilled tradesmen are benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let's allow them to keep that scarcity, encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree, and encourage everyone to pursue the field that best suits their abilities: not the one that will earn the most money. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

My relatives who farm and ranch work far harder physically than I ever will. \n\nA lot of the unskilled or semi-skilled alternatives are hard, too: logging, warehouse, agriculture are all brutally hard physically. There are some not physically demanding but highly or semi skilled, non-college trades, though - Jeweler, Printing Press operator, truck driver, surveying, aircraft mechanic. Really, if you get out of office/professional work, most jobs will require a higher level of physical activity.\n\nBut physical activity isn't the only measure of effort.\n\nDon't you think a doctor works hard, in terms of long long hours of residency and internship, 12+ years of brutal education, 12 hour surgeries? Or an attorney, preparing for a major trial, their clients life in their hands? Or a small business founder working 7 day weeks struggling to get their job off the ground? All these fields require a high amount of mental effort and time to succeed, although not in a purely strenuous physical work sense. That's the point, really -- there are no free lunch jobs that pay big money and let you dream away your hours.\n\n&gt;It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'.\n\nThis one I have trouble taking seriously. Do you mean \"prestige\", like astronaut or movie star? I personally respect anyone who has a professional attitude and puts their best effort into their job, whether or not they are a janitor, truck driver, plumber, grocery checker, or restaurant hostess. I've met doctors and senior managers for whom I feel little respect because of their terrible attitudes, M.D. notwithstanding.\n\nRespect is earned by the quality of your effort, your integrity, your dedication, and your attitude. Not by your degree or job title.\n\nChoosing a profession to get \"respect\" or \"prestige\" is something that will make you unhappy with your life in the long run, because you're seeking recognition from others to validate your self worth. That's always a losing bet for people who are hollow inside. Choose a job field that makes you happy, or at least not miserable, and then become the best at it you can. Anyone who can't respect an honest, hard worker is an asshole. There are lots of assholes in the world, and getting a prestige job to get respect from them for your job title is ridiculous.\n\n&gt;(The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce.\n\nWell, sure. That's how a free market works to set prices or wages. Jobs that are in-demand, but have a smaller talent pool available, will pay more than jobs that have a large pool of available workers and less demand. This has nothing to do with college, however. My best friend from high school got his masters in music and music history. Smart guy, fascinating field, worked hard in school and got the grades, but where's the demand for his skill? He ended up working as a bartender and has been for many years.\n\nJust any college degree will have much to do with your job opportunities, nor your wage. I think that's what people mean today when they advise young people to consider alternatives to at least certain college studies.\n\nI am a software engineer, with 25 years of experience, especially in embedded and mobile design. There's a huge scarcity of skilled practitioners in this field (I said skilled, meaning 'good' and productive) and salaries are huge - in some regions, we make doctor/lawyer money now, and I have no degree, I partied out of college and didn't graduate. All the mobile development businesses I know, including mine, have more work than workers to do it, and we're constantly on the lookout for hot talent, and will offer incentive$ to obtain it. (Please don't ask me to help you apply where I work via Reddit, I'm not going to out myself or employer here -- create a LinkedIn profile for yourself, list your skills and experience in mobile software development, and ours and many others' recruiters will find you, I promise!)\n\n&gt;Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing.\n\nThis sort of contradicts the supply-and-demand reasoning behind high wages for skilled trades you brought up earlier: Not many workers, lots of demand. \n\nWorkers in high demand fields are courted by employers who offer high wages and good conditions and benefits, and don't get much benefit from unionization. Those workers are already getting good deals, why do they need a union?\n\nUnskilled workers are faced with the dilemma that there are many other unskilled workers who would be glad to get their jobs, and then the union only works in that case if they can set exclusive hiring policies through law. If they can do that, they can create scarcity of labor in their occupation, wages go up, but then, how does the union prevent a huge influx of people wanting into that union and field? It becomes very difficult to apprentice and join that union, and you've essentially now got the union deciding who can work in that field, instead of employers.\n\n&gt;A college degree is still a worthwhile investment.\n\nSure, it might be, but that depends on the degree and how much you paid for it. We have a huge problem here in the U.S. with massive increases in tuition far outstripping inflation rates of the last two decades. It's an entirely different topic to discuss why, but suffice it to summarize, we've told young people for 40 years the best path forward is to go to college and get a degree, and so many, many young people do so, and we have a ready supply of student loan money coming out, so colleges and universities have a large pool of well-financed applicants competing for admissions. Back to that supply and demand thing setting prices.\n\nThe real stinger is far too many students are choosing courses of study that don't always have demand for employment. I love history, and was involved in music through college, even student-teaching on my chosen instrument.  I think people are much more rounded and have a lot of intellectual benefits from an education in arts in humanities. But, the economy needs engineers, biotechnology professionals, doctors and business managers. Study an art or humanity for the joy it brings you, but don't expect it to be in demand and support you for a living.\n\n"}, {"id": "2n1jje", "body": "From Mike Rowe's recent AMA to posts on /r/personalfinance, I see more and more redditors advising their peers to forego college and pursue a certification in a trade.

Having that as a constant weight over your head on top of other expenses such as Phone / Rent is just one more thing that you have to budget for, on an already tight budget.\n\n&gt;The kids that I see dropping out of college are pursuing majors that they weren't interested in the first place (chose because of the money or the career prospects) or in extreme cases: because of personal or life circumstances.\n\nWe had[a 41% dropout rate as of 2012](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40) and when nearly half your students don't complete their degrees, it's a bigger issue then either pursuing majors they weren't interested in OR life circumstances.  The sheer number of students who don't complete college reinforces my position that college is *NOT* necessarily the best way to go.\n\n&gt;I don't really buy that people 'don't know what they want to do with their lives'. Everyone has dreams, interests, and passions. Everyone has something that they're willing to give 80 hours/week to make a reality.\n\nI didn't.  ESPECIALLY at 17 when I graduated high school ...  There were things that I liked, but nothing that I was terribly passionate about (and that didn't change much till my late 20s)\n\nI don't disagree with you btw, when you say that we shouldn't encourage students into high profit degrees w/out interest.  I do however think that the rising costs of college, and the lower performance in the entry level job market makes that a riskier investment, especially for young people who take it lightly and treat it like high school 2.0.\n\n&gt;The worst thing you can do when you don't know what you want to do is to pigeon-hole yourself into one thing because you think it's stable and well-paid. \n\nJust to re-iterate, this isn't what I'm arguing for.  I'm merely pointing out that with the current costs, the higher interest rates, the predatory school practices (out of state tuition rates?), the underperforming job market, and the 41% non-complete rate, that college is a RISKY investment, that isn't one we should be pushing to everyone as a given.\n\nAdd to that, it's a *LOT* easier to change your mind and get into another career path down the line if you aren't saddled with massive student debt.  \n\nFinally, I'm not suggesting that students MUST do one or the other, but the prevailing narrative in our culture has been for the last two decades, \"Go to college\" Full Stop.  Adding in additional options for our students would benefit them greatly as it helps cut down on the number of students who do fail because they're pressured into something they aren't interested in.\n\nIdeally I'd like to see fresh HS graduates go out into the world for a year or two and experience the workforce as it currently is before deciding what they want to do.  It would make for better students (who take their classes more seriously) and would help them get more out of college overall."}, {"id": "2n1jje", "body": "From Mike Rowe's recent AMA to posts on /r/personalfinance, I see more and more redditors advising their peers to forego college and pursue a certification in a trade. I think this is generally bad advice: not because I think that *no one* should go into the skilled trades, but because 1.) I think most people aren't cut out for a trade career, and 2.) the stable income one can earn as a skilled tradesman is maintained by the scarcity of skilled tradesmen. To expand:\n\n**Skilled trade jobs are hard, physical work**: I come from a family of roofers, and live in an area that has been experiencing constant new home construction since the early '90s. My father was a satellite TV installer back when a satellite dish would take up most of your back yard, and a TV/telephone installer after that. Most of my (older) family members have had major knee, back, and hip surgeries in their 40s and 50s, and many have sustained life-altering or career-ending injuries. Physically, I would *never* have been able to pursue a career in the 'family business' (I'm a skinny dude), and I think it's better to work 40 years and retire with your body mostly intact than work 25-30 years and retire because you've destroyed your body and physically can't work any more. \n\n**It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'**. I'm sure many people don't care how society views their career, and would laugh in the face of someone who denigrates their job while making substantially less money. That said: there will always be *some* people who look down on the 'dirty jobs', and some people who avoid those jobs because of it. I don't think income level alone will be enough to legitimize certain careers at certain levels of society. I'm not saying it's right: I'm saying it's a reality. Some people will always balk at marrying a sewage technician, even if that sewage technician is making +$100k.\n\n**(The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce**. We will always need contractors, plumbers, electricians, and welders; but we only need so many. In the '70s, everyone was advising young people to go into medicine. In the '80s, everyone was advising young people to go into law. In the '90s, everyone was advising young people to go into technology and computers. Look at the job prospects of those fields today. Medicine is still well-paid, but only because it takes a decade (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to become a doctor. Starting lawyers are earning ~$40k, after accruing +$100k in law school debt. Information Technology grads have a higher unemployment rate than Theater or English majors. **Any field that experiences a rapid influx of credentialed professionals suffers from depressed wages and high unemployment.** If young people take the oft-proffered advice and enter the skilled trades: their experience is going to be worse. It takes much less time, money, and (please don't be mad at me for saying so) intellectual rigor to become certified as a skilled tradesman than it does to become a doctor, lawyer, or computer scientist. By the same token ...\n\n**Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing**. The trajectory of unions in the US has been sad and getting sadder for decades. Unions are the weakest today that they've been since before the Gilded Age. An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen, desperate for work in an increasingly saturated market, will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases, wages will fall. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states, unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no longer provide a middle-class income. \n\n**A college degree is still a worthwhile investment**. Statistically, a college degree is worth somewhere between $800k to $1.2m over the course of a working career. Even if a student takes out $32k in loans (the average for a college graduate), that investment returns many, many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a good investment to me. \n\nToday, as it stands, few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they don't garner the level of social respect that the so-called 'white collar' careers attain. For the people who still choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their pay and working conditions. Further, it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades (because of family background, physical prowess, and/or difficulty with traditional education) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who wouldn't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree (which would have been a better investment) to enter a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. \n\nSkilled tradesmen are benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let's allow them to keep that scarcity, encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree, and encourage everyone to pursue the field that best suits their abilities: not the one that will earn the most money. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Most of my (older) family members have had major knee, back, and hip surgeries in their 40s and 50s, and many have sustained life-altering or career-ending injuries. Physically, I would *never* have been able to pursue a career in the 'family business' (I'm a skinny dude), and I think it's better to work 40 years and retire with your body mostly intact than work 25-30 years and retire because you've destroyed your body and physically can't work any more. \n\n**It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'**. I'm sure many people don't care how society views their career, and would laugh in the face of someone who denigrates their job while making substantially less money. That said: there will always be *some* people who look down on the 'dirty jobs', and some people who avoid those jobs because of it. I don't think income level alone will be enough to legitimize certain careers at certain levels of society. I'm not saying it's right: I'm saying it's a reality. Some people will always balk at marrying a sewage technician, even if that sewage technician is making +$100k.\n\n**(The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce**. We will always need contractors, plumbers, electricians, and welders; but we only need so many. In the '70s, everyone was advising young people to go into medicine. In the '80s, everyone was advising young people to go into law. In the '90s, everyone was advising young people to go into technology and computers. Look at the job prospects of those fields today. Medicine is still well-paid, but only because it takes a decade (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to become a doctor. Starting lawyers are earning ~$40k, after accruing +$100k in law school debt. Information Technology grads have a higher unemployment rate than Theater or English majors. **Any field that experiences a rapid influx of credentialed professionals suffers from depressed wages and high unemployment.** If young people take the oft-proffered advice and enter the skilled trades: their experience is going to be worse. It takes much less time, money, and (please don't be mad at me for saying so) intellectual rigor to become certified as a skilled tradesman than it does to become a doctor, lawyer, or computer scientist. By the same token ...\n\n**Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing**. The trajectory of unions in the US has been sad and getting sadder for decades. Unions are the weakest today that they've been since before the Gilded Age. An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen, desperate for work in an increasingly saturated market, will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases, wages will fall. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states, unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no longer provide a middle-class income. \n\n**A college degree is still a worthwhile investment**. Statistically, a college degree is worth somewhere between $800k to $1.2m over the course of a working career. Even if a student takes out $32k in loans (the average for a college graduate), that investment returns many, many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a good investment to me. \n\nToday, as it stands, few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they don't garner the level of social respect that the so-called 'white collar' careers attain. For the people who still choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their pay and working conditions. Further, it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades (because of family background, physical prowess, and/or difficulty with traditional education) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who wouldn't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree (which would have been a better investment) to enter a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. \n\nSkilled tradesmen are benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let's allow them to keep that scarcity, encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree, and encourage everyone to pursue the field that best suits their abilities: not the one that will earn the most money. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Skilled trades are paid well because of the scarcity of them. I make 75 dollars an hour as an Oilfield welder, but only because it is tough physically demanding work. \n3. I think it is important to go to college, I personally am currently working on my masters in history. \n4. The idea of being chained to a desk does not suit some people, I recently was blessed enough to work along a 23 year old welder who is phenomenal at his job. He does so because, just like me, it is his passion. \n5.

Thats how scarcity in the job market works. \n\nHaving said that, and while your points are good ones, they still aren't adequate reasons to not pursue a trade. \n\n&gt;Skilled trade jobs are hard, physical work\n\nYes they are. And what is interesting is that a number of my family members have also had knee replacements, hip trouble, and other medical issues that arise from using your own body too hard for too many years. Most of them, however, gained those injuries through Skiing or Sailing too hard, not through manual labor. People will use their bodies how they see fit. If someone likes being active, why shouldn't they pursue an active trade?\n\n&gt;It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'\n\nThe longer skilled trades aren't respected, the less people enter into them, the more I get paid. I'm getting paid to (for the most part) drive a Van. If someone doesn't like that- Fuck 'em. Anyone who wants to judge me based on my career I wouldn't want to be friends with anyways (Unless that career was something like Professional Member of the Aryan Brotherhood). \n\n&gt;Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing.\n\nThis is a very valid point, but the wearing down of the unions is mostly due to the de-emphasization from a skilled-labor economy to a cheap-labor economy. Companies are trying to ensure a cheap work-force instead of a skilled one. So by and large, the reason unionization is diminishing is because of people thinking that skilled jobs and protecting the people in them is less important than playing your budget for stock-holders. \n\n&gt;A college degree is still a worthwhile investment.\n\nSkilled Jobs and College Degrees are not mutually exclusive. I have both, and many people I know have done the same. Two-year colleges and vocational degrees are still college degrees. They constitute higher learning. Even 4-year colleges offer *many* opportunities for skilled advancement, such as Welding or Accounting certifications. \n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2n1hpm", "body": "The punishment should fit the crime, not the outcome of the crime.\n\nThis was inspired this post on the front page: [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2mzuxe/father_throws_chair_at_judge_after_the_driver/)\n\nThe judge sentences a driver to 120 hours of community service for running into a family and killing 3 people, and the father, whom I can't even imagine the sorrow and anguish he is going through, throws a chair at the judge. The driver was known to be going 40 km/hr over the limit. I hope the judge and security guards were sympathetic to the extreme emotions and sorrow in the father's head, and the punishment to him, if any, is minimal.\n\nRegardless, and I don't feel that I'm being insensitive: I believe the judge's sentence was reasonable. The crime was \"driving 40 km/hr over the limit\". The outcome of the crime was people died. The outcome of the crime should not affect the verdict. **If you say \"the driver should be put in jail for *blank* years!\" it's very reasonable to say that anyone caught going 40 km/hr over the limit should also be put in jail for *blank* years. They just got lucky and didn't drive into anyone; the crime is identical.** To do otherwise is to make the legal system more about vengeance than keeping society under control.\n\nAnother example: ever seen A Clockwork Orange? Alex, the main character, beat a lady very severely. He was arrested, and the police wanted to charge him with assault, which was a relatively common and minor charge in the hyper-violent society. It wasn't until she died that he was really in trouble with the law, and the cops told him this. In my opinion, Alex should have had one charge/punishment against him the whole time: \"assault and battery with a strong possibility of causing death\" (which is a theoretical crime I just made up) and he should have been convicted of it regardless of if the lady died.\n\nYou couldn't make it \"perfect\" so that every single crime is as outcome-independent as possible, especially because some crimes aren't even apparent until the outcome happens. However, I still think outcome-independence is a desirable aspect of a sophisticated legal system and something to strive for as much as possible.\n\n**EDIT:**  I feel that everyone is arguing that what I'm suggesting would cause drastic changes in the legal system, but I don't really feel that it would. Here's some of the changes that would be made by attempting to be more outcome independent:\n\nHere are some theoretical punishments in a modern justice system:\n\n* Murder: 25 years\n\n* Attempted murder: 15 years\n\n* Firing a gun straight up into the air causing death (involuntary manslaughter): 5 years\n\n* Firing a gun straight up into the air not causing death: Community service. Perhaps brief jail time.\n\nHere's how a \"outcome-independent\" legal system would treat things:\n\n* Murder: 25 years\n\n* Attempted murder: 25 years\n\n* Firing a gun straight up into the air causing death (involuntary manslaughter): Community service.

It's trivial to demonstrate that someone firing a gun up into the air knew it was risky, or that a shooter knew shooting people was likely to kill them, or that a drunk driver knew their actions presented a hazard to others on the road.  It's virtually impossible to prove that a drunk person staggering to their car intended to drive home rather than sleep it off till morning.\n\nThe distinction is the separation of outcomes *within* the offender's control and outcomes *outside* their control.  We should not punish people for things which they had no control at all over.  However, we can punish people for things which *are* within their control that they realistically should have known *could* have a negative outcome.  This linkage is constrained by the bounds of foreseeability implied by \"*realistically* known,\" .\n\nIf you fire a gun into the air, you have basically no direct control over where the bullet lands or what it lands on, but good reason to believe that it'll land on *something* that might be human and squishy.  Since you have no control over whether or not the bullet actually hits someone, you cannot be held responsible for it.  However, you *did* have a reasonable level of control over whether or not to pull the trigger.  Because the effects of gravity are pretty foreseeable, it's reasonable to punish you for taking an action within your control (pulling the trigger) that *could* have a negative outcome (a bullet falling on someone's head) even though we can't justifiably punish you based on whether or not that negative outcome actually happened (since that portion is beyond your control).\n\nIt's true that you can argue all actions to be the inevitable outcome of prior conditions.  Indeed, you can even continue that train of thought right back to the literal beginning of the universe.  Regardless of how far you take it, though, you basically end up arguing philosophical determinism....and that's a whole different matter.  I think we can probably both agree there's at least a practical distinction to be made between \"certain actions that people do have control over lead to outcomes which, while foreseeable, could not be plausibly predicted in advance by the actor\" and \"the actions of all humans along with their consequences are entirely inevitable and involuntary.\"  (Even if the latter were true, however, that doesn't actually eliminate guilt: it eliminates most justification for retributive punishment, but the rationale for deterrence and rehabilitation still stand.)"}, {"id": "cm9jqkc", "body": "But why are you setting a line at certain outcomes and not others?

It's a subjective opinion. Law is subjective. If you ask me why I think the way I do, I'll point to this from my original post: \n\n\"If you say 'the driver should be put in jail for blank years!' it's very reasonable to say that anyone caught going 40 km/hr over the limit should also be put in jail for blank years. They just got lucky and didn't drive into anyone; the crime is identical.\"\n\n&gt;there is no guilt because everyone was unlucky enough to be born into a world where they would commit a crime\n\nThat's getting into free-will vs. predetermination, which is an entirely different debate. Sometimes you have to let things like that go in order to have a justice system work. Our justice system already is at a middle ground between outcome-independent and outcome-dependent. I'm just arguing we make it more outcome-independent and we strive for it."}]}
