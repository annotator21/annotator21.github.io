Black people can't help that there are a bunch of white people that feel guilty about their predicament because of the actions of their grandparents/great grandparents etc etc. They are in a shitty situation, so of course they won't turn down the aid, you wouldn't either if it was offered.\n\nThe problem is the poverty itself and well intentioned people trying to relieve their guilt in a misguided way.

Beyond that, the US is fucked up for a lot of reasons and there are a lot of different people to blame. So no, it's not racist to criticize black Americans, but it *is* racist to criticize *just* black folk. Really, it's inherently racist(or at least in acknowledgment of racism)  to address black people as a group at all, since everything associated with the racial identities, black and white, were conceived of by racism in the interest of racism. That is excepting skin pigment, of course.\n\nAlso, blaming black people for the problems that are faced by cities like Detroit is completely ahistorical and misses the point. Black people have, historically, been disempowered in their ability to decide the character of the US, their communities and their own person. I mean, there were no black or white people here until white people enslaved black people and used them in their conquest of the indigenous(brown) people of this land, which is what brought white people here in the first place. Then, white people made it illegal for black people to read, write, vote, use their own name, own property, or piss without permission while controlling their whereabouts at *all* times under threat of death, etc. *for 400 years*(nevermind the lifetimes of forced labor). \n\nKnowing this, and that for many poor black folk, these problems continue to this day, it seems pretty silly to suggest that black people have had any real power over the character and fate of things like the automobile industry, gentrification/suburbanization, and a neglected city infrastructure, all of which *did* ruin Detroit, and which has almost unanimously been ruled by people with \"white\" skin. \n\nAdditionally, you say-\n\n&gt;\"...they are stuck with a shitty reputation they don't deserve.\"\n\nThis happens everywhere with all sorts of people. Take this interaction we're having now: \n\nYou are a racist white person(bad). Because of people such as yourself, white people have a *reputation* for being racist, which I(a white person that seeks to *Not* be racist[good]), have to deal with.  \n\n&gt;\"This is a real racial issue that I never ever see anyone talk about.\"\n\nUm... you're essentially blaming black people for the effects of white imperialism.

To be fair though, most people in this country don't because unless you've taken university level classes in sociology, american history, etc. it has all been white-washed (no pun intended).\n\nWhen you take hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people away from their homeland, remove their culture, break up their families, subjugate them, then not educate them. Then after their release (about 175 years ago) spend the next 100+ years creating laws to keep them from getting educated and integrating fully into society. Then after there are laws to prevent that, you CONTINUE to subtly segregate schools, create laws with the INTENTION of \"cleaning up neighborhoods\" but basically amounts to putting black people in jail for being poor and resorting to crime (three strikes rule for example) which for many neighborhoods that have school-to-prison pipelines is the only option, especially with documented racism when applying for jobs. So you have 20% of the population that only one generation ago received the ability to go to the same schools as their white counterparts (i.e. receive the same education), but still continue to fail because when more black people show up, white people decide it's not a good area anymore and leave, thus lowering funding to the school and making it a failing school again. So you have a system that CONSTANTLY perpetuates itself. \n\n&gt;These gangs hide behind white oppression and continue their crime spree. Criminals are criminals and need to be dealt with brutally. They destroy black people's image and add fuel to the racial fire. If we wait too long the damage might be irreversible.\n\nSeriously, where are you getting this shit about gangs not having any check to their \"crime sprees\". Gang members are regularly put in jail, but these neighborhoods are the kinds of neighborhoods I spoke of above. Police officers aren't there to protect these citizens, it is ACTIVELY against them. So you have hundreds of people in this area, where police officers can't/wont differentiate between citizens minding their own business and those that are gang affiliated (because how can they even if they wanted to? If most of your neighborhood is or has one time been a gang member, EVERYONE is gang affiliated), then it just ends up being police officers vs. poor black people, so you end up with situations like Ferguson. \n\nAnd why are you so concerned with the negative aspects of black culture like the actions of shitty people define the ENTIRE race. Why aren't white people defined by serial killers and meth heads? Actually, better yet, why do we as a culture celebritize serial killers and make movies about them, but gang members are a detriment to the entire black race?\nIt's comments like these that make the other posters consider you racist.

A person shouldn't be blamed for the crimes of their parents, much less the historical crimes of members of their race (unless they perpetuate the crimes).\n\nHowever, in today's America, racism is still very real. Everything else being equal, a black person is at a disadvantage in our society compared to a white person (I'm going to use the example of getting a job). This might be due to bigotry being passed down from parent to child, or maybe it's natural. In fact, I think a lot of it is natural. First, studies have shown that people tend to prefer people of their own race, so because white people are largely in charge, you are more likely to get a job than your hypothetical black counterpart (who hypothetically is only different from you in that you are white and he is black).\n\nSecond, let\u2019s look at your probable encounters with both races. In the population of white people, a larger proportion is in the upper/middle class. So in your encounters with white people, it is likely that a majority of the time, you see the person as a nonthreatening, hardworking, successful member of society. You may have seen some poor or \u201cthuggish\u201d white people, but not as many as the former. Thus, you are more likely to see white people in general as nonthreatening, hardworking, and successful, purely due to your frequency of exposure.\n\nNow looking at black people. They have a much larger proportion of lower class members (due to historical inequalities). Members of the lower class are much more likely to be uneducated, and to fall into criminal activities due to lack of resources. So in your encounters with black people, you will more often come across these poor, perhaps criminal people than successful, nonthreatening people. So you will likely see black people in general as poor and threatening, and all the negative connotations that come along with it.\n\nYou (or I) are not at fault for this bias in perception. It is natural; it serves an evolutionary purpose. If you come across something threatening several times, you will fear or hate it in the future. However, this means that because you are white in this society, you are automatically at more of an advantage than your black counterpart. A black person blaming you for past white crimes, or even for society\u2019s state, is folly; but it is also folly to consider yourself as equal to black people in terms of advantage.\n"}, {"id": "cm94zti", "body": "&gt;I just don't like being accused of committing sins I had nothing to do with.\n\nI agree that you shouldn't be criticized for crimes of the past. A person shouldn't be blamed for the crimes of their parents, much less the historical crimes of members of their race (unless they perpetuate the crimes).\n\nHowever, in today's America, racism is still very real. Everything else being equal, a black person is at a disadvantage in our society compared to a white person (I'm going to use the example of getting a job). This might be due to bigotry being passed down from parent to child, or maybe it's natural. In fact, I think a lot of it is natural. First, studies have shown that people tend to prefer people of their own race, so because white people are largely in charge, you are more likely to get a job than your hypothetical black counterpart (who hypothetically is only different from you in that you are white and he is black).\n\nSecond, let\u2019s look at your probable encounters with both races. In the population of white people, a larger proportion is in the upper/middle class. So in your encounters with white people, it is likely that a majority of the time, you see the person as a nonthreatening, hardworking, successful member of society. You may have seen some poor or \u201cthuggish\u201d white people, but not as many as the former. Thus, you are more likely to see white people in general as nonthreatening, hardworking, and successful, purely due to your frequency of exposure.\n\nNow looking at black people. They have a much larger proportion of lower class members (due to historical inequalities). Members of the lower class are much more likely to be uneducated, and to fall into criminal activities due to lack of resources. So in your encounters with black people, you will more often come across these poor, perhaps criminal people than successful, nonthreatening people. So you will likely see black people in general as poor and threatening, and all the negative connotations that come along with it.\n\nYou (or I) are not at fault for this bias in perception. It is natural; it serves an evolutionary purpose. If you come across something threatening several times, you will fear or hate it in the future. However, this means that because you are white in this society, you are automatically at more of an advantage than your black counterpart.

It's a poverty issue, but people don't look at poverty, only skin color.  Schools are funded from the communities they are in.  Therefore if you come from a poverty-stricken area of the country, your education also suffers if you are fortunate enough to have one.  Lack of higher education, coupled with living in poverty, increases crime and disparity.  This affects more than just blacks though.  Something like 20+% of white families, 40+% of black families, and 30+% of Hispanic families all live at or below the poverty line; many living in areas like Detroit where economic recession has hit especially hard.  There are no simple fixes for this but race is not the issue.  \n\nAreas not hit as hard by economic factors are doing better, but there is an obvious trend when you look at statistics regarding where criminals come from, both income-wise and educationally.  My argument is that race does not create crime.  Poverty and lack of education increase crime.  When we can give everyone the help they deserve (Employment, Family Wellness, and Housing) and the education they deserve: we'll begin seeing a vast change in America.  \n\nJust to add another view to the conversation; incarceration rates in the U.S. are one of the highest in the world.  Our prison system does not focus on rehabilitation for criminals to help get them out of the lifestyle.   Instead we focus on punishment and removing those criminals from our society.  What this system does is create a massive population of repeat-offenders that have no other recourse but to return to the disparate areas, with no chance at a career or even a part-time job, and begin the cycle all over again.  \n\nThis is my first post here, but I hope it wasn't a terrible one."}, {"id": "2mz4ex", "body": "Please CMV, I hate thinking this way but I look at the population and crime trends and can't help but blame them.

A king shouldn't be questioned because they have divine right to the throne. That only works if God isn't pissed off at you, which means keeping the church happy.\n\nSo on top of effectively being in control in certain kingdoms, like the Holy Roman Empire or Byzantine before that, the church had incredible influence basically all of Europe.\n\nThat's the Catholic church, of course.

My freshman year I had to take a year long class about Detroit, including its history and why it is the way it is. \n\nThis is going to be a condensed answer. Detroit was called the \"Paris of the Midwest\" in the 1950s-60s. It was the city to go to in the USA. Then you had the \"White Flight\" in the 60s. That was all of the white people moved out of the city because inner city blacl people were basically moving into the white people's neighborhoods. The white people, being racists, didn't want to live near black people so they left, taking their tax dollars with them. The teachers union focused on getting more money for teachers instead of teaching children, so now the graduation rate of Detroit Public Schools is around 25%. Take into account that the less education in a given area, the greater the crime rate is, much of the crime can be attributed to that. Also, there were many democratic policies that encouraged laziness. For more on this go to YouTube and search \"Steven crowder Detroit.\" He also talks about the teachers union and the United auto workers union. I would post a link but I'm in my phone. There was also a study I read about (hopefully I can find it when I get home) that suggested for every 1% increase in non-white population, there is an almost immediate 1.5% increase in crime. Within a year, the crime rate has increased 3%. With Detroit's population being 90% black, 5% white, and 5% Hispanic, if this is true, then there's gonna be a lot of crime.  I believe it was the US President Lyndon B. Johnson who made a policy that gave money to single women with children. The more children you had, the more money you received. But if they got married, the money stopped. So this created a generation of children who more often than not, didn't have a father figure in their life. This lack tends to create hyper masculine men who must prove they are a man. They prove it by fighting, being aggressive etc. Coming from w broken home tends to increase chances of criminal behavior. Also, the mayors, specifically Kwame Killpatrick, haven't focused on helping the people. They've only focused on making money and being in power. Kwame had murders covered up that happened in his house that was done on his orders, if I recall correctly. \n\n\nHopefully this has helped. Detroit has gone through some tough times, and it's not the citizens of Detroit's fault. They are the victims who have been put in a bad situation and they are dealing with it the best they can. It's the end result of racism and bad government policies and leadership. \n"}, {"id": "cm95bc3", "body": "&gt; The white people, being racists\n\nMeaning, didn't want to stick around for the impending increase in crime and violence and decreasing quality of life characteristic of black neighborhoods.

Blacks can't ever be criticized?! You don't watch/listen to conservative entertainment very often then my friend because they do it all day long.\n\nAs for the issue of a city like Detroit specifically, a place once reffered to as the Mobile of the north, their problems stem more from segregation, redlining, poverty issues and things like that. A successful black person in Detroit would still have to live in the ghetto side of town because home owners associations didn't want niggers in their neighborhoods, which means you ended buying a house that would never appreciate in value, especially as the conditions around you got worse, meaning your investment was wasted and you get no equity or anything of worth for buying a home, which means you have less wealth, which means our children have less options and chance for economic mobility, etc.\n\nContrary to the beliefs of people like Bill O'Rielly this isn't a black community issue it is an American issue of the past sending echoes into he present and many whites ignoring that fact."}, {"id": "2mz4ex", "body": "Please CMV, I hate thinking this way but I look at the population and crime trends and can't help but blame them.

Do you think after slavery was abolished and integration that all black people had a big meeting and decided to act like thugs and raise crime rates? No. Study up on the history of America. Its like, if you shipped a bunch of Irishmen to Japan, left them to do whatever then returned in 50 years, would you expect the Irishmen to be at the top of the social ladder? No. You can't blame an entire race of people for ruining something that A) They didn't have anything to do with and B) no individual black guy wakes up in the morning and thinks \"Hmm, I'm gonna rob a bank today so I can fuck up America a bit more.\" You can't blame a single person for a big picture problem. \n\n&gt;How come we can't admit that horrible black people exist? How come we just keep blaming whites for everything?\n\nWho blames whites for everything? I've only ever seen that on places like /r/tumblrinaction, never or very little in real life.

You just say \"horrible people exist\" and leave irrelevant information like race out of it.  \n\n&gt;I'm treated like a KKK member when I criticize black people.

We live in a country with social welfare programs because they benefit society as a whole, not just the person receiving the benefits.  People have needs.  The most basic are food and shelter.

People don't want to be poor and social welfare is a sort of insurance.  Shit happens, people loose their jobs, or get sick and go bankrupt paying medical bills, or simply fuck up and gamble it all.  As a society we insure that if you fail because of your own mistakes or because of unfortuante circumstances beyond your control you won't starve to death.  You can get help so you can improve your life.  \n\nThere is no welfare program that doesn't have work requirements or allow benefits indefinitely.

Provoke some dude to beat her to have a reason to receive money from that foundation.\n\nSeriously, that is ridiculous.

How to draw the line and actually help those in need and not to help those who \"in want\"?\n\nHave you honestly ever met a person who wants to be poor?  I know I never have.  We live in a country with social welfare programs because they benefit society as a whole, not just the person receiving the benefits.  People have needs.  The most basic are food and shelter.  When a person don't have those things and no means of obtaining them legally they will resort to illegal means because no one just says fuck it, I have no money and am hungry, I'll just lay down and wait for death to come.  \n\nThere may very well be individuals who are perfectly happy being poor and taking handouts but the vast majority are not.  People don't want to be poor and social welfare is a sort of insurance.  Shit happens, people loose their jobs, or get sick and go bankrupt paying medical bills, or simply fuck up and gamble it all.  As a society we insure that if you fail because of your own mistakes or because of unfortuante circumstances beyond your control you won't starve to death.  You can get help so you can improve your life.  \n\nThere is no welfare program that doesn't have work requirements or allow benefits indefinitely.  Welfare is a safety net, not a lifestyle arrangement.\n\n&gt;And the same goes with everything else we give money to.

None of it requires a supernatural agent of any kind (requires in the sense that the God hypothesis passes Occam's Razor better than the naturalistic one).\n\n&gt; yet you're *completely* ignoring the philosophical side of the question which is *integral* to this discussion. \n\nWhy is that so?\n\nThe discussion is that a God who has a non-zero effect on the natural world must be scientifically measurable. If not, then he is at best an absentee landlord (cf. deism) and at worst nonexistent (cf. atheism). \n\n&gt; You're asserting that science is the only kind of proof that exists, \n\nNo, I'm asserting that it is the only kind of proof required to and capable of providing evidence of a God having an effect on our universe. \n\n&gt; and we've already established that A) it is not the only proof that exists \n\nOf course not, but the only one relevant to the problem at hand. \n\n&gt; and B) it has it's own problems and flaws as a proof due to the nature of academia.\n\nI don't understand what that means. Nor how we have established this. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmaff9e", "body": "&gt; This is both an argumentum ad populum and a non-sequitur. Having scientifically researched God and being a believer who happens to be a scientist are two different things.\n\nAnd what exactly qualifies as scientifically researching God? For a scientist who is a theist, *everything* they do would be \"researching God,\" and scientists who are theists look at the body of research about our world and deem it compelling evidence for their position. You're looking for a \"God test\" that is somehow a special case in science when I and many others find the current research as valid in its own right.\n\n&gt; No, what these effects are falls in the realms of naturalistic science, seeing as they are effects this entity has on the natural world.\n\nThey don't, in the sense that you want them to. God is not a natural being, therefore does not fall within the realms of \"naturalistic science\" as naturalistic science pre-supposes the non-existence of the supernatural, and anything physical whose source is God that you test for you'd simply say has a naturalistic explanation because of this position you take:\n\n&gt; Everything we observe in the natural world has a naturalistic deterministic explanation.\n\nYou're presupposing the conclusion. I can just as easily say \"everything in this world has a supernatural indeterministic explanation,\" but that doesn't make it the correct stance. Both positions function equally well within our observed world. Whether you're theist or atheist, determinist or indeterminist, our world will function as it is, with no \"discernable\" difference outside what you personally feel based on your chosen worldview.\n\n&gt; I don't understand what that means. Nor how we have established this.\n\nScience deals with non-supernatural, therefore by nature you can't \"test\" for God, and academia as whole has a nasty habit of filtering only the results that it preemptively deems \"correct\" in some sense, though that isn't the fault of science itself.

They punish wrongdoing with pains, especially through hells. They are against euthanasia or suicide that can end pain (but not causing more pains to others).\n\nMoreover, prayers are likely to cause more pains. Medical treatments are more effective in reducing pains than prayers. Taking law into own hands by killing a serial killer or mass murderer in a lawless society is more effective in reducing pains in more victims than praying to the gods to take action against the murderer. There will be one act of reducing pain fewer for every act of praying, unless praying is the best act of reducing pain because there are no better ways.\n\nIf gods/religions condone and encourage causing of pains to others, this justifies causing pains to others by their followers\n\n**2.\tMany gods/religions teach their followers to be selfish and mean by condoning and encouraging such act: religions will only work through following or converting, followers need to pray or worship to be protected by the gods. There are rituals to follow. Humans who don\u2019t follow the rituals are not protected and non-followers are none of their business.\n**\n\nSuch act is selfish and mean and many gods/religions condone and encourage that, set bad examples and allow their followers to be selfish and mean at the expense of social order, altruism, etc.\n\nGods/religions also teach their followers to be bullies by allowing this:-\n\nSome humans are and will be disillusioned of gods or disbelieve gods because they see the unfairness in the world and gods\u2019 indifference to the pains and sufferings of the world or other reasons. Yet they still worship gods because out of fear of the supreme beings or because the laws require them to do so \u2013 this amounts to bullying. And many gods condone that, allowing their religions to be used as tools of bullying.\n\nBullying contributes to vicious cycle that undermines social order. It\u2019s like spanking is not effective in educating the children.\n\n**3.\tMany gods/religions teach their followers to lie by condoning and encouraging under-delivery of promises and claims. This amounts to lying and boasting.\n**\n\nThe followers are told that gods are kind, but they are arguably evil http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2myq67/cmvthe_world_would_be_better_off_without_the/cm900qw. There are told miracles happen but many are just false hopes. The followers are told the gods will always be there, but absent when the followers are in great pains.\n\nIf gods/religions condone and encourage lying and boasting, they allow one victimizing others through making false statements.\n\n**4.\tGods/religions condone their teachings to be not pragmatic (which is a moral quality)\n**\n\nMany religious moral principles become useless when the followers stop believing the gods, or are disillusioned with the gods, etc. It\u2019s inevitable sometimes their followers will lose faith of their gods, due to despair, etc., even just for a short moment. So the gods will just abandon them because of the brief moment of disbelief? Shouldn\u2019t they have teachings that work during time the faiths are lost or their faiths are in other gods?  \n\n**5. Gods don\u2019t ensure accuracy and consistency in their teachings by condoning flexible interpretation of their teachings by not being clear enough or not taking punitive action against followers who misinterpret the teachings to justify causing of pains to others.\n**\n\nMisinterpreting religious moral principles can be a threat to social order because the impact of the teaching is profound and the teachings can\u2019t be questioned. The prophets or priests/monks, etc. could make mistake in interpreting the gods\u2019 teachings. The religious codes can also be misinterpreted for bad reasons:-\n\n&gt;Religious values can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on murder, mass atrocities, and slavery. For example, Simon Blackburn states that \"apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels\n\nIf religious moral principles can be misinterpreted at will, many acts can be justified by just interpreting the principles differently. \n\n&gt;A new study in the academic journal Theoretical Criminology (hat tip to the Vancouver Sun) suggests that, far from causing offenders to repent of their sins, religious instruction might actually encourage crime. The authors surveyed 48 \u201chardcore street offenders\u201d in and around Atlanta, in hopes of determining what effect, if any, religion has on their behavior. While the vast majority of those surveyed (45 out of 48 people) claimed to be religious, the authors found that the interviewees \u201cseemed to go out of their way to reconcile their belief in God with their serious predatory offending. They frequently employed elaborate and creative rationalizations in the process and actively exploit religious doctrine to justify their crimes.\u201d\n\nNew Study Suggests Religion May Help Criminals Justify Their Crimes -http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/03/08/faith_based_prison_programs_new_study_suggests_religion_may_help_criminals.html\n\nIf religious moral codes can be misinterpreted at will and gods/religions condone such act, the moral codes are by no means moral."}, {"id": "2myq67", "body": "If a human can blindly accept the existence of gods without scientific proofs, he is more likely to blindly accept other claims without evidence or with feeble evidence. Such claims are more likely to be false or pseudoscientific ones and the beliefs of which can be harmful to him. \n\nIf humans would accept claims based on as many proofs as possible, demands for scientifically proven solutions, which are more likely to be beneficial, would increase and supply of pseudoscientific or deceptive solutions, which are more likely to be harmful, would fall. Such shift in demand and supply would make the world a better place.\n\nI even think if without such beliefs, the world would be more scientifically advanced in a positive way.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: Sorry for my poor English.\n\nEdit: I was ill-prepared to ask this question. I should have had enough proofs to support my view before asking your help to change my view. Thank you you guys for replying. One day I'll come back with the same view as I want this view to be without a shadow of doubt (I have no doubt about my view, I just want others to prove me wrong).\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter reading the comments, apparently the problem is with me.\n\nI can\u2019t believe in things that are without scientific proofs. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe in gods and ghosts until they are proven without reasonable doubt. I don\u2019t have faith in them to the extent that I even have no qualms about asking them to go fxxx themselves (no offence to you all, just to stress a point).\n\nAs such, I assumed that others must be like me, that is, any belief must have scientific basis; if one believed in something which was not scientifically proven, he or she was deemed dumb. Because accepting something as truth without scientific justification was just unthinkable to me.\n\nBut I was wrong; not everyone is like me. Scientific explanation needs not be the basis of having religious beliefs.\n\nOthers can believe in gods for many other non-scientific reasons or even no reason at all.\n\nMany people are dumb, religions are not to blame. Many people are intelligent; their religious faith will not make them less intelligent.\n\nHowever, because of absence of proofs, we will never know whether religions are making the world a better place or the opposite. The comments are just unproven opposing views that changed my unproven view. \n  \nAnyway, thanks for your insights.

It's literally true that huge chunks of the United States are in non-native hands because our ancestors made treaties with natives *and then broke them* by stealing land they'd agreed to leave to the natives, which was then retroactively made legal by forcing the natives to renegotiate the treaty and accept the theft as a fait accompli.  We have profited immensely from the theft our ancestors carried out; we have a duty to share some of that profit with the descendants of the people we stole from.\n\nBut there's also a pragmatic argument: everyone is better off if reservations are not corners of land populated by illiterates with serious social and psychological problems - because eventually a society of socially and psychologically disturbed illiterate people who cannot make a living is going to cause problems for its neighbors.

Most people have no lawful route by which they could ever move to the US or any other wealthy country.

Most people have no lawful route by which they could ever move to the US or any other wealthy country.  People who have the ambition to move and work hard to improve their lives and their families lives are doing something that is noble and good.  Even though a law is broken in the process, I do not believe they have done something morally wrong by breaking that law, and would not punish them harshly, if at all, for the violation.\n\n* It does appear to be within the bounds of current law.

It's much more reassuring to hear \"We'll always be together\" and \"It's all going to be ok\" from someone with more life experience than you. It's much more persuasive to hear \"You HAVE to do this. This is what a loving partner does\" or \"Come on, don't be such a kid about it\" from an older person.

I am sixteen and a guy. I have never had a sexual encounter with an adult, but I would not be opposed to such a situation. I don't understand why age factors into our concepts of concent. I can understand that it might be easier for an adult to force a child into something and I'm certainly not condoning anything in which either party feels uncomfortable, but aside from very young children who cannot experience sexual pleasure and so have no motivation or reason to engage in sexual activity, I think that if a minor and an adult feel like it then they should be able to have sex.
