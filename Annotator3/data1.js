Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in self-defense should also support abortion in at least some cases, if not all.** \n\nThe main justification for being pro-gun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other self-defense tools is that guns are used to kill, not incapacitate. By being pro-gun, you are pro-giving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Pro-gun activists can't really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it's likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else's life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\n\nNext, the main justification for being pro-life is that fetuses have \"personhood\" and deserve the same rights as people. If you're pro-gun, however, you're arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother's health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first, as in [the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) However, it can be more broadly applied to other, less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home, you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least, abortion must be legalized in cases of rape, as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your body/property. \n\nThis doesn't mean pro-gun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves (just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home), but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. \n\nA counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent. However, this argument doesn't really fly. Firstly, there's no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home - maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly, even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime, it is still by its very existence invading another person's body/property if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a person/fetus into your home/body you don't have the right to kill them, but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.\n\nFinally, there's no corollary here - because pro-choice arguments don't rely on personhood, there's no hypocrisy in being pro-gun rights or pro-gun control because it's a completely separate issue.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If she disagrees that state power should be used to prevent violence (or thinks that state power is worse violence than violence between citizens), she's basically disagreeing with the very premise of a state. Given that the status quo is that she lives in a state, she should then follow through and attempt to dismantle the state if she believes that will reduce violence.

This topic isn't about moderates who only support gun use for hobbies and recreation.\n\n**tl;dr, or the way I should've phrased the thread initially: CMV: Abortion is a form of self-defense. Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in self-defense should also support abortion in at least some cases, if not all.** \n\nThe main justification for being pro-gun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other self-defense tools is that guns are used to kill, not incapacitate. By being pro-gun, you are pro-giving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Pro-gun activists can't really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it's likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else's life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\n\nNext, the main justification for being pro-life is that fetuses have \"personhood\" and deserve the same rights as people. If you're pro-gun, however, you're arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother's health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first, as in [the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) However, it can be more broadly applied to other, less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home, you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least, abortion must be legalized in cases of rape, as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your body/property. \n\nThis doesn't mean pro-gun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves (just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home), but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. \n\nA counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent. However, this argument doesn't really fly. Firstly, there's no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home - maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly, even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime, it is still by its very existence invading another person's body/property if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a person/fetus into your home/body you don't have the right to kill them, but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.\n\nFinally, there's no corollary here - because pro-choice arguments don't rely on personhood, there's no hypocrisy in being pro-gun rights or pro-gun control because it's a completely separate issue.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Pro-gun activists can't really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it's likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else's life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\n\nNext, the main justification for being pro-life is that fetuses have \"personhood\" and deserve the same rights as people. If you're pro-gun, however, you're arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother's health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first, as in [the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) However, it can be more broadly applied to other, less critical abortions.

However, this argument doesn't really fly. Firstly, there's no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home - maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly, even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime, it is still by its very existence invading another person's body/property if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a person/fetus into your home/body you don't have the right to kill them, but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.\n\nFinally, there's no corollary here - because pro-choice arguments don't rely on personhood, there's no hypocrisy in being pro-gun rights or pro-gun control because it's a completely separate issue.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in self-defense should also support abortion in at least some cases, if not all.** \n\nThe main justification for being pro-gun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other self-defense tools is that guns are used to kill, not incapacitate. By being pro-gun, you are pro-giving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Pro-gun activists can't really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it's likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else's life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\n\nNext, the main justification for being pro-life is that fetuses have \"personhood\" and deserve the same rights as people. If you're pro-gun, however, you're arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother's health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first, as in [the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) However, it can be more broadly applied to other, less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home, you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least, abortion must be legalized in cases of rape, as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your body/property. \n\nThis doesn't mean pro-gun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves (just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home), but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. \n\nA counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent.

This isn't a case of sperm breaking into a uterus to cause a pregnancy. \n\n&gt; Right, like by getting an abortion if that is what the pregnant woman wants to do.\n\nThe OP stated that the situation applies even if you consider a fetus to have \"personhood\". Are you justified in killing an infant because you no longer want it?  When you have sex, you go into it knowing that pregnancy is a possibility. The purpose of sex is to procreate. If pregnancy results because of sex, you have brought that situation onto yourself.\n\nConversely, you don't move into a house to have it intruded upon. The natural and expected result of moving into houses is not intrusion by strangers. Therefore, killing a stranger intruding your home is different than killing a fetus that resulted from sex. \n\nI'm not here to argue against abortion. However, it's not hypocritical to see these situations differently. "}, {"id": "2nxt7j", "body": "Edit: \"Pro-gun\", as I'm using it, is a stance supporting personal gun ownership on the basis of the 2nd Amendment and personal protection. This topic isn't about moderates who only support gun use for hobbies and recreation.\n\n**tl;dr, or the way I should've phrased the thread initially: CMV: Abortion is a form of self-defense. Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in self-defense should also support abortion in at least some cases, if not all.** \n\nThe main justification for being pro-gun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other self-defense tools is that guns are used to kill, not incapacitate. By being pro-gun, you are pro-giving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Pro-gun activists can't really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it's likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else's life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\n\nNext, the main justification for being pro-life is that fetuses have \"personhood\" and deserve the same rights as people. If you're pro-gun, however, you're arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother's health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first, as in [the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) However, it can be more broadly applied to other, less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home, you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least, abortion must be legalized in cases of rape, as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your body/property. \n\nThis doesn't mean pro-gun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves (just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home), but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. \n\nA counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent. However, this argument doesn't really fly. Firstly, there's no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home - maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly, even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime, it is still by its very existence invading another person's body/property if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a person/fetus into your home/body you don't have the right to kill them, but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.\n\nFinally, there's no corollary here - because pro-choice arguments don't rely on personhood, there's no hypocrisy in being pro-gun rights or pro-gun control because it's a completely separate issue.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That being said, there are plenty of games that intelligently use large numbers, and the key is to start small, and allow the player to really feel the progression of their character. \n\nI'll use Dark Souls as an example. When you start the game, at the very beginning, you literally hit for 1-2 damage. You actually encounter a boss at the very beginning that you're practically unable to damage, and eventually have to run away from. Then you play through a tutorial-esque area, pick up your starting equipment, and go back to fight the boss, now hitting for 20-30 damage. \n\nThen you leave the tutorial area and arrive in the open world of the actual game. What's important about the open world of Dark Souls, and many good RPG games, is that it allows you to explore and find enemies that you're not ready to face. Right of the bat, Dark Souls allows to player to explore areas that aren't meant to be tackled until you're over halfway through the game. But just like in the tutorial, you have to leave these places and comeback later. It takes a good but of exploring to find the intended \"beginning\" of the game. \n\nSo you play through the game, gradually upgrading your weapons and leveling up and eventually your damage is in the hundreds, and later even thousands. Then you go back to those late-game areas that you found before, and suddenly you can kill these enemies in 3 hits rather then 10. You can eat a hit from that giant monster without dying. You've become stronger and you can really feel it. And that's not even the best part. Oftentimes you have to backtrack through old areas, and when you fight enemies from early-game (which used to be able to kill you in just a few hits) you can 1-shot them with ease, you can tank 20 hits without healing once, you can see how much more powerful your character has become because the game shows you. \n\n "}, {"id": "2nx6is", "body": "I understand that my title may be a tad confusing so I will attempt to explain.\n \nWhen playing a game, I believe that characters should have 100 health.

But in many cases there's a good reason for numbers becoming so large:\n\nWhen a game statistic increases, it's usually not the absolute increase that matters in terms of perception, but the increase relative to what you already have. If you get +10 HP, that's a lot if you had only 10 HP to begin with. However, if you already have 1,000,000 HP, +10 HP isn't even noticable. Rather it's the *proportional* increase that matters. In terms of feeling, 1 HP is to 10 HP as 100,000 HP is to 1,000,000 HP: both are 10% of what you already have.\n\nSo for each level to feel equally significant, it has to be 10% (or whatever) higher than the previous level. So you start with 100 HP. At level 2 you have 110 HP. At level 3 you have 121 HP...\n\n... aaannd that's geometric growth. If the game goes on for a while, you *will* reach some large numbers, even if you started small and the increase per level is not that large. In this example, your HP is 100 * 1.1^level . By level 60 you'll have 27,680 HP. There is *no way around this* if you want each level to feel equally significant and all you have is straight damage numbers getting subtracted from HP.\n\nThis doesn't rule out having stats besides DPS and HP and presenting the numbers differently even if the practical outcome is the same. For example, you could keep damage and HP constant with level and instead apply a 1.1x modifier to damage for every level difference between attacker and defender. However, some might argue that the straight damage/HP increase is more intuitive/badass."}, {"id": "2nx6is", "body": "I understand that my title may be a tad confusing so I will attempt to explain.\n \nWhen playing a game, I believe that characters should have 100 health.

For the most part, systems like this are RPGs, in which a character needs to progress through the story and get stronger over time (as opposed to, say, an RTS or DoTA style game where there is a set range of powers that units can have at max.) The idea is that you are going on a journey and as you fight, you gain power just in time to defeat ever-stronger enemies. \n\nFirst, by gaining power, it gates low-leveled characters from high-leveled content. If you're a level 1 and can do 1% of damage per second to a mob, then an end game boss would be no problem (or atleast not as bad of one), especially if the boss is only hitting the player for a percent. In game, a boss that is even a bit too hard should seem like an insurmountable challenge until you reach a certain stage of progression (allowing you to deal more damage and take more damage). The consequence of this progression is that, after a few levels, you become FAR stronger than you did before. A mob that was difficult 10 levels prior (because it is effectively a level gate) is now trivial. The cost is that 10 levels is a large difference is character stats. \n\nAnother effect in play here is a bit more minor, but it is an effect of RNG. When a character is at a low level of a certain stat, namely HP, it allows for random (non-skill) events to affect the player. A player at level 1 with 10 hitpoints might get unlucky and get hit critically a few times in a row and die. That's not soemthing the company would like, and I doubt most players would enjoy losing just due to random chance. Having larger health pools, and thus a larger variety of applicable damage ranges makes this easier to work with. E.g. A player in the first scenario could get hit with attacks that do 1-2 damage or up to 20% of his life at once. Other than not actually doing damage, this is a lower limit on the damage the player can take. A player with 100 hp can take, say 13%-9% of their life by a mob. The mob could get \"lucky\" and hit hard a few times, but it wouldn't completely wreck the player. \n\nIf we start getting into things closer to end-game, psychology also plays a large effect. One is not hitting new levels as rapidly, due to the nature of the game, but there still needs to be a sort of gating mechanism so that gameplay can still allow character progression. This is why your equipment has different qualities. It allows progression gating at higher levels (near a level cap or effective cap due to exponential increase of xp required to progress). With this comes further damage creep: to give the impression that you are in fact stronger, you hit harder on a given mob with better gear and a slightly higher level. In order to keep the difficulty constant, the health and damage of level-appropriate (or gear-appropriate) mobs are increased. This is magnified as you reach the cap because of level-gating, and further at a cap due to the gear- gating. And so on and so forth.\n "}, {"id": "2nx6is", "body": "I understand that my title may be a tad confusing so I will attempt to explain.\n \nWhen playing a game, I believe that characters should have 100 health.

I generally find that games that rely very heavily on leveling for their difficulty balancing often have huge leaps in health as you advance, with the idea being that someone at a lower level than recommended, even just slightly lower, will have a much harder time getting through.\n\nThe other thing to consider is how much precision is built in to the system.  I know enough about Diablo to know that it can be extremely competitive and that monitoring and regulating your health is essential.  Having those extra digits means that tiny changes in healing rates or other status effects can manifest themselves in a way that the player can see.  For people who like to know *exactly* where they're at, it can be appreciated.\n\nAlso, as a bit of an afterthought, higher numbers add more room for RNG to be effective.  It allows enemies to do variable amounts of damage with each hit without forcing them to do way more or way less damage that they should have been doing.  A good example is Civilization V.  Initially the health system had a ten-point system, but it was changed to a 100-point scale in the expansion packs.  The nice thing about this was it meant that battles that were ridiculously one-sided (attack helicopters versus cavalry or something) wouldn't be forced to do either a full 10% damage, which is unrealistic, or no damage at all, effectively rendering your unit invincible.

Let us say you start at 10 hp and hit for 1 damage with the monsters in the starting area also having 10 hp and do 1 damage.  It will take 10 swing to kill them.  Let us say you level up a bit.  Now you have 15 hp and do 2 damage.  Now it takes you 5 swings to kill them and 15 for you to die.  Then, you go to a new area.  The monsters here should feel harder than how it felt when you started, so they now have 20 hp and do 3 damage.  It takes you 10 swings to kill them and 5 to die.  You level up a bit more and now you have 24 hp and do 4 damage.  It now takes you 5 swings to kill a monster and 8 to die.  Now on to the next area.  Even if the scaling is kept rather constant, if you still want to have it take 10 swings to kill them and 5 to die, they should have 40 hp and do 5 damage.  You would then level up to having something like 40 hp and do 8 damage.  You might be able to see at this point how the process can snowball after only a couple of levels.  Most games have more than this.  The game I have been playing the most recently (Path of Exile) has about 100 levels worth of areas to go through, so when you start with 57 to 66 hp (depending on class) you will easily end up with a couple of thousand at max level.\n\nIt isn't the large number itself that is supposed to make you feel badass, but what it means when you compare your high level self with what you faced in low levels.

To someone who thinks on a more complex level, you can see right through the psychology and it's not a factor to your enjoyment, it's just a big number in a pool of big numbers.

Yeah, it sucks, but there are so many worse people out there. The insurance companies who cause countless deaths every year because all they care about is profit, the warmongering leaders of countries like the US, or, fuck, how about the Islamic State, Kim Jong Un, the Mexican drug cartels, or the big banks of the world?

But if all we care about is the size of our bank account, why not just be a criminal? You can make quite a lot of money if you're successful, after all.

And money can make one unhappy. For reference:\n\n\n \"...This study provides the first evidence that money impairs people\u2019s ability to savor everyday positive emotions and experiences. In a sample of working adults, wealthier individuals reported lower savoring ability (the ability to enhance and prolong positive emotional experience).

Furthermore, individuals weight upward comparisons more heavily than downward comparisons. According to the rank hypothesis, income and utility are not directly linked: Increasing an individual\u2019s income will increase his or her utility only if ranked position also increases and will necessarily reduce the utility of others who will lose rank.\" Boyce, Brown, &amp; Moore, 2010. \nhttp://pss.sagepub.com/content/21/4/471.short\n\n&gt;I hated my chosen profession also.

However, if people can skip the whole 'hate my profession' phase... why shouldn't they? Sure, they might take a cut in a paycheck (how much will vary, of course), but if their goal was going to be to escape a profession in the first place, it would seem that the smarter bet is to simply not enter the profession in the first place if they have the choice.\n\n&gt;See, things like this drive me crazy. No, you can't guarantee happiness- no one can, but having money increases your odds exponentially. There are probably a lot of reasons why the person in that AMA didn't have a fulfilling relationship, but money wasn't one of them, and I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts that that person would be in roughly the same situation without the money, and the car, and the job.\n\nThe explanation given was that the sacrifices they had made were not worth it. They did not attempt to pursue relationships (or deeper friendships) because they were giving all of their time to their company in order to make their position and income stronger. And they regretted it because the money wasn't worth what they gave up."}, {"id": "2nw4eu", "body": "I submitted a CMV earlier about [setting the conditions upon which I would pay for my kids to go to a top school](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2nv869/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_parents_setting/).

More workers means lower wages.\n\nThis means that you would *always* have people caught up in the system who would get royally screwed. Even if you assume a conservative 3 years of graduating classes entering the market as an X, this is still a considerable amount of employees.\n\nThe other problem is this means low wage positions will cost more, as a result the services they provide will cost more as well.

To me, this is a ridiculous, and potentially harmful worldview.  \n\nLike other CMV's you fall into a false dichotomy.  Either you are happy or have good income.  The advice you are considering harmful is not that happiness is more important than money, but that you should look for a balance between income and happiness.  \nFirst of all income stability depends on your lifestyle.  Some people with a $250k salary can spend it all, get into debt and then go broke and someone else with a $55k a year can live a perfectly happy life, so income means nothing as long as you are above the poverty line, and this is what /u/redditeyes is referring to.  Once above the poverty line, the amount of money doesn't correlate with happiness anymore.  \n\nSo, although it's good advice to take into account potential income when choosing a career, if it's the only criteria you might end up doing a job you hate, you won't be very good at it, you might have stress and relationship issues and end up being more unstable than a career with a smaller income but makes you enjoy life.

A high school student little interest or poor marks in math and science is probably not going to be successful as a STEM major.  On the other hand, if they are a competent artist or public speaker, it makes a lot more sense for them to go into advertising, even if the median pay is less.\n\nI think the biggest problem with your world view is that you are only looking at one facet of a job, the earning potential.  Jobs that pay really well do so to attract employees.  They have to do this because there is something hard about the job.  Either the skills are hard to master, the job is dangerous, the hours are terrible, or some other reason.   Biologists aren't paid more out of kindness, its because its really hard to become a biologist.  And most people can't do it.\n\nDid you know that the dropout rate for STEM majors is really high?  It's not because people are lazy, its because the skills being taught are extremely difficult and complex skills that lots of people have a very difficult time learning, internalizing, and then applying them to complex problems.\n\nGetting a college degree is not an interchangeable task.  Lots of people with degrees in one field would fail to complete a course of study in another. You shouldn't look at it as \"Get a STEM degree\" vs \"Get an Art History degree\".

You will be spending a lot of time at work, if you hate what pays the most what is the point of it? Most of your life is spent badly.\n\n2. More important is what you're good at. You can say people should go to law school or medical scool or STEM but the question is will they be able to be sucessful in that field? With no interest and no talent, they can study the \"right\" thing and suck at it, guaranteeing them to never go far.\n\n3. Not everyone needs or aims to be very rich. FOr me for instance, I only want enough money to be able to support myself, I know if things go wrong my family will help, I don't need much to support myself - to be able to pay the bills, few luxuries like drinks and food. Every now and then something bigger. Maybe support a dog. my material needs are just not that great. But time is important to me, what I do with it. Even when getting education, I want it to be intellectually stinumating and important to me rather than to take from my time just to prepare me for the job that will do the same. \n\n4. Related to all points, you never know where the person will end up making it or not. You can study something you aren't crazy about or particularly great at and even though its a lucrative field, you'll end up either doing a low paying job related to the field, or even something unrelated all together. Or you can study something you are good at and love, and even if its a more difficult field when it comes to landing a great job, your affinity can lead to success. You can study STEM and work as an elementary/middle school teacher, you can study art and work in a finest gallery or museums.

I do disagree with this one.\n\nFirst, there is a huge difference between a hobby and a career. Being able to do something as a side project/personal interest is completely different from the thing you're forced to do everyday to survive.  Anecdote: my sister was a fine arts major. Worked doing data entry for a year with decent pay and benefits;  absolutely hated it. She now works a labor-intensive job making high-end furniture w/ worse pay and fewer benefits and fucking loves it. Id much rather see her happy with her day-to-day life than making more money being miserable. \n\nSecond, if everyone should do the most money making job, we'd all be doctors and lawyers but that doesnt ma\nke sense. Additionally,  people who take those kinds of jobs work insane hours, so if it's not their passion, they're not gonna have all that much time for hobbies. Maybe not for everyone, but definitely for a good number of people, taking the high paying job is mutually exclusive to doing what makes you happy\n\nEdit: As an afterthought, your view completely depends on valuing material wealth over all else. If a person does value material wealth in this way then im sure they'd agree w you. Thats not the only perspective though, as is exemplified by Buddhism among other traditions. So is your argument that you should value material wealth primarily or that material wealth is a necessity regardless of personal values?\n\nEdit 2: do you not plan on retiring? Because if you do, your arguments seem pretty circumstantial.  If it's not ok to do what you love at the expense of potential income in your 20s, why would it be any better in your 70s? Maybe you've made enough in your life by that point to fund whatever else you want to, or maybe (as you said) the amount you've saved could always be in jeopardy to fluctuating markets.

The basic comparison here is STEM majors compared to liberal arts majors (although there are exceptions in both cases but we'll stick to being general for now). STEM majors may generally have a higher earnings potential, but that doesn't mean that every student would succeed in them. If you take a liberal arts student and put them in a chemical engineering program they probably won't succeed in that program and may drop out, and vice verse for an engineering student in a liberal arts program. Different people succeed in different fields. Now with that in mind, what's more valuable; a couple years in a STEM field with no degree, or a degree in a liberal arts field?

Or to make matters more interesting - it doesn't show the fact that the interventions are being conducted under false pretense. \n\nThose are deliberately designed local conflicts which serve to *destabilize the region* and thus put it under the control of the US and its allies with the implicit purpose to neutralize the growing influence of China and other emerging superpowers. It is global politics 101 and you can see analogies throughout history. The most recent one would be Israel which - in contrast to current US-Israeli relationship - was very strongly supported by France and Britain for the first decade of existence while the US was fairly reserved.  The reason for that was because Israel was seen as a key strategic ally in maintaining French and British post-colonial and colonial influence in the region (Middle East was French and British after WW1).\n\nThere are  examples of foreign intervention which worked WW2 being the most obvious one of them - although it is far from an ideal example because of how botched it was in the very end. \n\nIn reality if the US wanted to really fix the issue in the Middle East it would have to accept the regions political independence and antagonize Saudi Arabia who are the biggest supporters of militant Islam in the region.\n\n"}, {"id": "2nw1t2", "body": "We are currently seeing a major Western intervention in Iraq and Syria, and I believe that it is doomed to fail. Per the carrot and stick paradigm, \"stick\" interventions (airstrikes, regime change/invasions, sanctions) tend not to work as they either create a convenient scapegoat (the West is bombing us! It's their fault!) or serve to galvanize support for their target (the West is trying to overthrow our lawfully elected leader!) Although undoubtedly their are exceptions, such as when a government calls for American or European help, attempting to force change or defeat an enemy using sanctions or violence is bound to backfire and instead strengthen support for, and the moral standing of, the targeted force. For instance, as the West is striking ISIS targets, ISIS is gaining more and more \"white\" recruits from Western countries who are seeing the conflict as a chance to strike out at American imperialism rather than simply a puritanical sharia war. I don't know what we should do, short of a purely humanitarian mission, but I believe that using \"the stick\" to punish ISIS, Assad, or Putin is bound to be the best thing ever to happen to ISIS, Assad, or Putin.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They're all anti-heroes of a degree.  These kinds of characters can drag a show in a dark direction, Ed and Ein provide much needed aloofness to keep the show from going to serious.\n\n&gt; The main villain Vicious is especially bad.\n\nVicious is as well developed as Spike.  They're two sides of the same coin.  Both exhibit strong death wish behavior.  Vicious is jaded with humanity, and has lost a lot of his empathy.  I watched Jupiter Jazz and saw a man who lost his faith, and saw that the only thing worth having in life was Power.  Maybe it was Julia cheating on him, maybe it was being betrayed by Spike, or just as likely both of those two instances that jaded him.\n\nWe know that Vicious and Spike were very brotherly from the flashbacks, that love triangle shattered all of them (Julia included).\n\n&gt; Aside from that, the quality of the episodes varies dramatically.

Sure, there are fantatsic episodes such as Waltz for Venus and Ganymede Elegy, but there are also fairly ho hum episodes such as Bohemian Raphsody, Speak Like a Child, and Boogie Woogie Feng Shui.\n\nBohemian Raphsody was an excellent world building episode.  It gave character, history, and insight to the entire Cowboy Bebop universe itself.\n\nSpeak like a Child was a hugely important character building episode for Faye, who prior to this, as mentioned, was Amnesiac and had given up hope on every knowing where she came from.\n\nBoogie Woogie...yeah, it's weird.  Always struck me as a more \"Asian\" episode, and possibly filler.  It does give us a little more on Jet, but it is probably a lower point of the overall series.  It happens.\n\nFor me, the greatest enjoyment of Bebop stems from all of the main character's flaws.  They're all really broken people.  I like that.  I like that Spike, Jet, and Faye all have serious issues.  Why else would they be bounty hunters? A dead end job if ever there was one.  Successful, happy people don't go cruising around the solar system barely making ends meet.  It's a career for the destitute.\n\nIt also has a nice touch of comedy and camp, the Mushroom episode in particular stands out as hilarious, or Toys in the Attic which was a nice 20 minute homage to *Alien*.\n\nThen there's the darker points, where the creators painted a pretty grim cyberpunk universe. *Gateway Shuffle* where they deal with the immortal child - the result of technology gone wrong, Bohemian Rhapsody of corporate greed, and also an allude to Gateway; or *Pierrot le Fou* - The genetically engineered super assassin.\n\nThe greatest strength of Cowboy Bebop is the fully \"lived in\" feel of the universe.  Long haul space truckers, massive prison ships, homeless populations living in wrecked out stations and ships, colonized planets that are hazardous to it's population, the wrecked Earth, Omniscient Crime Syndicates.\n\nAll too often Anime's have preposterous worlds and characters, often teenagers, doing ridiculous things in situations where you just have to accept what's going on.\n\nNot Bebop.  It features a largely adult cast, who are flawed with weaknesses, agendas, and vendettas.  They live in a world with very little handwaving, and there are countless little touches that breath reality into it.  Shit is broken down, the protagonists are perpetually broke and broadly scoundrels.  Ambiguity seethes out of every nook and crevices, and it's done so well, so thoroughly...that is why it deserves to be called one of the Greatest Ever.\n\nIt did things that are really hard to do with Anime, it did them extraordinarily well."}, {"id": "cmi2h7a", "body": "&gt;  Ein's introduction as a \"data dog\" or otherwise hyperintelligent canine goes nowhere and he spends the rest of the show just being the crew's pet.\n\nYeah, it's a dog.

She's a deeply flawed human, but she is as much a victim of circumstance as she is an asshole.\n\n&gt; Ed is hit or miss, and walks the line between endearing and annoying, but hardly receives much development beyond her introductory episode.\n\nEd, like Ein, is also largely comedic relief.\n\nSpike, Jet, and Faye are all fairly serious individuals, who do nasty things for money.  They're all anti-heroes of a degree.  These kinds of characters can drag a show in a dark direction, Ed and Ein provide much needed aloofness to keep the show from going to serious.\n\n&gt; The main villain Vicious is especially bad.\n\nVicious is as well developed as Spike.  They're two sides of the same coin.  Both exhibit strong death wish behavior.  Vicious is jaded with humanity, and has lost a lot of his empathy.  I watched Jupiter Jazz and saw a man who lost his faith, and saw that the only thing worth having in life was Power.  Maybe it was Julia cheating on him, maybe it was being betrayed by Spike, or just as likely both of those two instances that jaded him.\n\nWe know that Vicious and Spike were very brotherly from the flashbacks, that love triangle shattered all of them (Julia included).\n\n&gt; Aside from that, the quality of the episodes varies dramatically. For an episodic show that only has about five episodes that build a overall story, that's saying a lot. Sure, there are fantatsic episodes such as Waltz for Venus and Ganymede Elegy, but there are also fairly ho hum episodes such as Bohemian Raphsody, Speak Like a Child, and Boogie Woogie Feng Shui.\n\nBohemian Raphsody was an excellent world building episode.  It gave character, history, and insight to the entire Cowboy Bebop universe itself.\n\nSpeak like a Child was a hugely important character building episode for Faye, who prior to this, as mentioned, was Amnesiac and had given up hope on every knowing where she came from.\n\nBoogie Woogie...yeah, it's weird.  Always struck me as a more \"Asian\" episode, and possibly filler.  It does give us a little more on Jet, but it is probably a lower point of the overall series.  It happens.\n\nFor me, the greatest enjoyment of Bebop stems from all of the main character's flaws.  They're all really broken people.  I like that.  I like that Spike, Jet, and Faye all have serious issues.  Why else would they be bounty hunters? A dead end job if ever there was one.  Successful, happy people don't go cruising around the solar system barely making ends meet.  It's a career for the destitute.\n\nIt also has a nice touch of comedy and camp, the Mushroom episode in particular stands out as hilarious, or Toys in the Attic which was a nice 20 minute homage to *Alien*.\n\nThen there's the darker points, where the creators painted a pretty grim cyberpunk universe. *Gateway Shuffle* where they deal with the immortal child - the result of technology gone wrong, Bohemian Rhapsody of corporate greed, and also an allude to Gateway; or *Pierrot le Fou* - The genetically engineered super assassin.\n\nThe greatest strength of Cowboy Bebop is the fully \"lived in\" feel of the universe.  Long haul space truckers, massive prison ships, homeless populations living in wrecked out stations and ships, colonized planets that are hazardous to it's population, the wrecked Earth, Omniscient Crime Syndicates.\n\nAll too often Anime's have preposterous worlds and characters, often teenagers, doing ridiculous things in situations where you just have to accept what's going on.\n\nNot Bebop.  It features a largely adult cast, who are flawed with weaknesses, agendas, and vendettas.  They live in a world with very little handwaving, and there are countless little touches that breath reality into it.  Shit is broken down, the protagonists are perpetually broke and broadly scoundrels.  Ambiguity seethes out of every nook and crevices, and it's done so well, so thoroughly...that is why it deserves to be called one of the Greatest Ever.\n\nIt did things that are really hard to do with Anime, it did them extraordinarily well."}, {"id": "cmihkup", "body": "Holy shit, I just typed out a response but it got borked.\n\nFirst off, I have to apologize for the late reply.

Many of the ways Ein was used would not be out of character for a dog character in any other show. The instance in Brain Scratch being the outlier, which could have been easily written for Ed to do instead.\n\nSure, in another show, but even in that context, most dogs on shows are abnormally intelligent.  Ein being a 'data dog' could just as well be argued as a justification for his abnormal intelligence.\n\nIf Ein hadn't been given a backstory, and had instead just been a dog that was there from the beginning, or say, introduced with Edward, would you have as much issue?\n\n&gt; I don't consider \"bad shit happened to her\" as a showing of good or well written character. Otherwise angsty JRPG protagonists would be frequently lauded instead of critiqued. Many of the shitty parts of Faye's character seem to be more related towards showing negative female stereotypes than being a product of the terrible things that happened to her.\n\nMaybe, Faye is incredibly tropey.  But all the bad shit that happened to  her is basically the entire reason she acts that way.  I never viewed Faye as just a bundle of bad female stereotypes. She knew she was physically attractive, and used the hell out of it. She's not afraid to do what's necessary.  \n\nShe's also a compulsive gambler, a kleptomaniac, incredibly selfish, and afraid of human relationships.  She's the embodiment of damaged goods, and I thought the series did an excellent job of portraying her just so.  You shouldn't love her, or necessarily like her.  She's a shitty person.  But so is Spike. And so is Jet.\n\n&gt; I can name ten anime shows that don't have fanservice.\nFMA 2003, FMA Brotherhood, Kino's Journey, Madoka, Princess Tutu, MuShiShi, Tokyo Godfathers, Spice and Wolf, Baccano, Honey and Clover. That's just the shows I've seen and off the top of my head.\n\nOkay? Doesn't change the fact that Fan Service is pretty much part and parcel of Anime.  For every 1 you can name without, it's pretty easy to name 5 more with.\n\n&gt; Fair point, but that's mostly involving the short plot twist at the end. Most of the episode is build up that goes on too long.\n\nI mean, I thought most of the episode was making fun of collectors and Otaku, personally.  And then the little bit at the end was a nice way to through in some story arc and character building in an otherwise one off episode.\n\n&gt; Like /u/Waylander0719 , I feel you're extrapolating too much. While I agree with the idea of the Death of the Author, I feel you're taking too much that that the show did not present as a part of Vicious' character. Not to mention your interpretation is entirely subjective.\n\nHow can it be too much? It's pretty apparent that Spike and Vicious are were pretty good buddies, given both their flashbacks and conversations.  Then their triangle with Julia caused a big split.\n\nIt could also be argued that Vicious is just a straight up violent psychopath, hence why Julia fell in love with Spike despite being with Vicious first, and also why she was afraid to meet him: Fear of her own life.\n\nI really feel that Vicious was purposely left vague, hell I feel we, as the audience, learned more about Pierrot le Fou's life than we ever did  of Vicious.  He's open to a lot of different interpretation.  But more importantly, he's just not that important to the Bebop story.\n\nFor me Bebop will always be the story of Spike, Jet, and Faye.\n\nOne of Bebop's strength, is the before mentioned world building, the scoundrel characters, and ambiguity of who they were, and what they did, before we met them.\n\nIt's a Slice of Life show, where we get to peer into a dirty, dangerous, violent future for humanity where we've killed our home planet, done nothing to advance our species as a whole, and just keep on doing the same shit we always do.\n\nWe meet some kick ass dudes bounty hunting, of all things, and we soon learn they are sketchy as hell and really not all that nice or heroic.\n\nAlong the way meet a Femme Fatale and we see how their lives intermingle for this brief moment in time before they part on their separate ways.\n\n&gt; Kino's Journey is about a traveler who visits a different town for no more than three days with each town having a different custom and thought provoking philosophy.\n\n&gt; Honey and Clover is a coming of age story about several art students.\n\nLiterally about teenagers.\n\nIt's also about an androgynous teenager with a **talking motorcycle**.\n\n&gt; Spice and Wolf is about economics and a slowly budding romance between a merchant and an immortal.\n\nAn immortal who conveniently takes the shape of a 15 year old girl...with a wolf tail and ears.\n\n&gt; You've made a great essay, and it's definitely a good starting point, but I want the second punch to knock me out. You speak of broken or flawed characters, but I could name a lot of shows that feature flawed characters. What makes Bebop's cast so much better than say Baccano's or FMA's?\n\nAnime is overwhelming targeted towards teenagers, and typically features juveniles with fairly juvenile problems and flaws.  People keep talking about FMA, but I seriously could not get past the first episode.  I just really struggle to get into shows with wunderkinds.\n\nBebop features an almost entire adult cast, with adult problems.\n\nSpike is a former mafia assassin on the run.  I believe he's a badass because he's lived as long as he has.\n\nJet is a washed up, divorced cop.  He's turned over a new leaf and is trying to lead a new life.\n\nFaye is a jaded woman who got burned to badly.  She's permanently indebted, stuck in a future she knows nothing about, and has an extremely limited skill set.\n\nIt's not just their flaws, but it's also them being *believable* flaws.  I know total badasses in their late 20's, their called MMA fighters.\n\nI know washed up divorcees finding a new life in the middle of their thirties.\n\nI know jaded women with limited skill sets.\n\nI love Bebop because it's a universe because that's believable, because it's lived in, because it's characters are a bunch of scoundrel-y, shady, shitty people.  Hell I love it because they still use conventional firearms and weaponry, despite having inter-solar travel (because it does make sense)\n\nThey're perpetually broke, and that's largely the reason why they have some many odd-ball adventures (and episodes)  Bounty Hunting is shitty work for shitty pay, and this crew always gets the short end of the stick.\n\nBebop's animation and music are also superb, but that's side dish to the main course.\n\nI can show Bebop to a wide swath of people and they'll like it.  I can sell it.  \n\nIt's a lot harder to sell FMA, Evangelion, or DBZ, or Naruto, or Gundam, or a whole shit load of other popular animes.  They're too fucking preposterous, or full of angsty bullshit, or just poorly written.\n\nBebop's world isn't clean cut, there aren't even any clear heroes here.  It's all shades of grey, it's purposeful ambiguity, strongly opposed to the laziness you sort of imply.  One-off characters get loads of development throughout the series.  It's not as if they lacked the imagination to develop characters, it's just that of the ones you point out lacking development simply didn't need it.\n\nBebop is about shitty people living in a shitty world doing shitty things.  And it's awesome for it."}, {"id": "2nvy5j", "body": "Let me preface this by saying that I really do like Cowboy Bebop. The animation and designs are sublime, the soundtrack is fantastic, the action is great, and when all three come together the show can occasionally become a jaw dropping audiovisual masterpiece, particularly in the breathtaking finale.\n\nHowever, there are so many problems with it that I cannot in good faith call it a \"masterpiece\" or proclaim it to be one of the best of the medium as anything other than a gateway show.\n\nI'll start off with the characters, which is where many of my problems lie. I'll admit, Spike and Jet are great characters, but they are only 2/5 of the entire Bebop Crew. Ein's introduction as a \"data dog\" or otherwise hyperintelligent canine goes nowhere and he spends the rest of the show just being the crew's pet. Faye exhibits many of the worst characteristics that can be written about a female character; she's bossy, greedy, obsessed with her own beauty, needs to either be rescued or is a hinderance to the group more often than an asset, she often wears revealing clothing for the sole purpose of fanservice. Ed is hit or miss, and walks the line between endearing and annoying, but hardly receives much development beyond her introductory episode.\n\nThe main villain Vicious is especially bad. He has very little character and motivation aside from a desire for more power, and even though the show goes a bit into his backstory it never establishes motivation. At the end of the show, Vicious is little more than an evil guy in a black coat with enough fighting skill that it makes Spike struggle to land a bullet in him, aside from the obvious fact that Vicious becomes a representation of the syndicate Spike ran away from.

Little story nuggets are littered throughout the remaining episodes that seem to only add to the experience. \n\n\nEpisodes of Cowboy Bebop are kind of like the numbered Megaman games: not all of them are perfect, but the worst Megaman is better than the best game with ET in it by far. Bad bebop episodes are never a total loss. I'll go back and watch them this evening (just the bad ones) to confirm this, as it has been a while, but Bebop was always one of those shows that would be on while raiding, or while playing cards or something. It was my Matrix for a while.\n\nNow, this is of course all perspective and subjective. There might be someone who's life has lead them to the point that when they view Bebop, it is tainted by their past. Someone like myself viewed it at the right time in my life and it was better fit to appeal to me. I view things in this realm as \"the amount of perspectives that are perceived as good determines objective good from our subjective human standpoint\". \n\nIt's not about the amount of people that like something really, but each DIFFERENT type of person that regards something as a work of art adds to its subjective credibility in our declarations of our misnamed \"objective goodness\" scale. There exist so many well done elements, in the two major versions (english/japanese), that appeal to so many people that it SHOULD be held up as a banner of it's media.

We see her incredibly concerned and frustrated about it all, but when she finally gets everything, she doesn't have an impactful enough of a change to satisfy the buildup.\n\nEd - by far my favorite character in the show, but greatly downplayed. For someone who is in the opening song and has a unique and popular personality, she was often just on the sidelines. I think there was only ever 1 episode that she was the center of (the mushroom one) and, while awesome and hilarious, it didn't give us any insights into her. I was disappointed with how her meeting her father went nowhere, and then she just abruptly leaves everyone? So dissatisfying...\n\nVicious is just so one-dimensional. While I really enjoy certain completely-100%-evil villains (Azula!) he was just so melo-dramatically cliche and uninteresting as an enemy.

Despite this she finds herself falling for Spike. \n\nWhile I get what you're saying, I don't agree with the notion that having tragic things happen to a character makes a likable or well written character. It doesn't really address my previous issues with Faye's character, both how she acts and how she's written.\n\n&gt;One thing everyone seems to forget is her father manages to take out Spike with ease and by using only some chicken eggs.

He doesn't just beat spike he treats him like a child.\n\nNot going to argue against this, but Ed's dad is a tertiary character and only around for a few minutes. Also, I don't consider 'being a badass' a necessarily good character trait. Not going to argue against Ed either, again I don't hate her but I would have liked more to her other than comic relief.\n\n&gt;Him and Spike were partners, as close as brothers.

Spike left the syndicate because he didn't want to go down that road and vicious sees it as a slap in the face that someone he respected so much rejects him and his worldview so completely.\n\nI think my problem with this is you're extrapolating a lot. The story doesn't go into nearly as much detail as you're giving it credit for. While some narratives work well in giving bare details for viewer extrapolation, I don't think Bebop pulls it off well. Furthermore, when you break it down to the bare essentials the story looks like \"two bad men, both loved a woman but the one that got the woman became good while the one that didn't became evil\".\n\n&gt;But my question to you would be which Anime are better?\n\nI'm really glad you asked this question, because it could very well be my own personal preference that's getting in the way.\n\nI like shows as bombastic as Bebop such as Baccano, but where Baccano succeeds where Bebop fails is that Baccano has a much more entertaining cast of characters that all have well developed and explored personalities. The only characters that aren't likable in some manner are either gloriously hammy or over the top villains.\n\nI also enjoy both FMA series, which balances an interesting story alongside a great cast of characters, inventive ideas, and a gripping story.\n\nThen there are the \"slow burn\" shows that are much better enjoyed at a slower pace or emphasize the atmosphere and storytelling. Kino's Journey, Spice and Wolf, Honey and Clover, and Princess Tutu are all on my favorites list.\n\nAnd of course this is excluding the fantastic works by Satoshi Kon and Miyasaki (which reminds me, I need to rewatch Tokyo Godfathers now that it's December again).\n\n&gt; I thought the ending was perfect, it wasn't a happy ending, but the good guy won.\n\nOh fuck yes, totally fantastic ending that I wouldn't have any other way...\n\n\n...if only the creator didn't ruin it by saying Spike survived."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2nvxqw", "body": "I am a 25 year old woman going to marry a 45 year old man, and we have been together since I was 20 years old.

The thing is, I absolutely know it is not going to fail and the only thing that will lead us apart is going to be someone's death.\n\nI don't think my love is the most \"special\" in the whole world, and I certainly don't think I am the only person who has ~ever felt like this~ but I know many people in marriages of 20-25 years duration who have less trust, compatibility, love, and happiness in their relationship than we do.\n\nThe main criticisms I see are 1) \"You can't possibly be compatible in maturity and life interests\" (which is untrue, because I doubt we would be able to have a 5 year long relationship if this was true) and 2) \"he is going to grow old and you'll be miserable\" (I don't know if this will happen, but I know that love is strong enough that people who love each other will be there for each other in youth &amp; old age).\n\nI'm curious as to what other people think is a main concern for these types of age difference relationships. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We have family friends who have a similar age gap, and it's really hard on the woman (who's younger).  Her husband is ~20 years older than she is, and it shows.  While this may not be true in your case, consider that he's likely to slow down well before you do.  Someone at 80 isn't going to want to do the same things as someone at 60.

You've been together five years... how has that been?  Do you find yourself making compromises for his lifestyle, or him for you, that are directly related to age?  Does he treat you as an equal?

For that matter, what is the difference between an 8 and a 9, or a 9 and a 10?\n\nThat depends on the reviewer, and they usually say what the ranges mean. For example, the PCGamer's review system is defined as:\n\n* 00%-10% Absolutely no value and/or actively offensive. Are you playing one of these games? Take 3d6 emotional damage. e.g. Big Brother\n\n* 11%-39% Yikes. Technically broken, or so fundamentally flawed that it's ultimately not worth any time or money. Bad. e.g. The War Z\n\n* 40%-49% Functional, but majorly flawed and disappointing. e.g. Aliens: Colonial Marines, Star Trek\n\n* 50%-59% Mediocre. If it has any interesting ideas, they don't work well. Might suffer from bugs or technical issues. e.g. Primordia, Painkiller: Hell &amp; Damnation\n\n* 60%-69% An interesting idea that's been poorly expressed, or a derivative idea that's executed averagely. There's something here to like, but it can only be recommended with caveats. e.g. SimCity, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified\n\n* 70%-79% Good, but not a classic. A recommendation, but not a glowing one. e.g. Assassin's Creed 3, Shadowrun Returns\n\n* 80%-89% A great game with exceptional moments or features and touches of brilliance. e.g. Arma 3, Gone Home, Titanfall\n\n* 90%-94% A compelling recommendation for most PC gamers. Ahead of its time and important to PC gaming as a whole. Making out with greatness. e.g. Dota 2, Europa Universalis IV, Borderlands 2\n\n* 95%-98% Absolutely brilliant. This is far and away one of the best games we've ever played, and we recommend it to the world. e.g. Half-Life 2, Minecraft, Spelunky\n\n* 99%-100% Advances the human species. Life-changing. A masterpiece and more. Actively boosts the immune systems of nearby children and small animals.\n\nAs you can see, there is actually quite a difference between the categories.\n\n&gt; When I read a review, what I really want to know is that they're both great games, and you would recommend them to people, particularly those who enjoy that genre. And a 1-5 system gets that across with no ambiguity.\n\nNot really though, since again, there is just too much ambiguity between the numbers. In fact, it's actually kinda ironic that you argue about reviews being to ambiguous and then argue for what is possibly the most ambiguous review system possible. \n\n&gt; If you really want to reserve a rating for the truly terrible and magnificent games, then that can be done - you could use a 0-6 scale, where awarding 0 and 6 is exceedingly rare.\n\nBut at that point, if we're just adding to the scale, why not just make it x/10 or x/100? It's cleaner, and far more specific. \n\n&gt; But I certainly feel that by the time you start using a 1-10 scale, you lose too much clarity. Does a 7/10 mean the game is pretty good, or is that their way of marking it down?\n\nAgain, the reviewers will have an explanation for their grading system, and will often list the reasons for this score by the review to show you why it deserves that score.

You've gained insight from non-private satellites, used our roads, and generally used tax funded things your entire life. From what I hear, corporations are people, but even without such an inane bit of word crafting, your business exists inside of the infrastructure that has been created by the will of the people as realized by our tax dollars.\n\nNow, this is just why *you* should pay taxes. I'm certain some manor of \"hard earned money\" will be thought of when it comes to giving any of it away, but you get quite a bit for your dollar. The bigger a business is, the more stress it puts on our infrastructure as a whole. You use more roads, you create more rob-able, murderable things for police to protect and structures to ensure fire free. Large corporations are stressing our capacity and not giving back in the form of taxes.\n\nIt is suggested as a trade off. We let them use our tax funded things that make us more a first world country than not, and they provide us with jobs, the one thing Americans prize more than their own freedom. Is it worth the cost? I think it would be more worth it to call their bluff, and see how well they do without America to pay their corporate welfare. That's my uninformed and unasked opinion though.\n\nShort version: Corporations are like people on lawn chairs.

Society needs rich people to look up to.  \n  \nFor example, in my own personal case, my business makes just enough money for me to survive. It pays my car, insurance, rent, and food. Thats just about it. It's critical for me to keep this business, and a tax bill of ANY amount would put me under. Yet, at the end of the year, im supposed to come up with 20-30% of that money that was already spent on rent and food long since digested. I will happily learn about and utilize any tricks that let me avoid taxes. I fully support moving your money to tax havens as well. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When large amounts of tax are avoided it means the government services that businesses rely upon will degrade. It gradually poisons the watering hole for all businesses in order to make short term gains.\n\n&gt; Society needs rich people to look up to.\n\nI have no problems with the admiration of a rich person although admiring them because they are rich seems a little empty to me. I admire enterprising people because of their skill and drive, not their bottom line. I would not admire someone who does not pay their dues as that makes you selfish. I would not rate a selfish person as admirable unless they have helped society to such a degree that it counter balances this selfishness.\n\n&gt; Rich corporations? Good, you deserve the extra income, because you had the skills and LUCK to get to the spot you're in now.\n\nWhen a corporation is assisting society then I am delighted to see it doing well. If it is in it's situation through luck then I am ambivalent. A lot of corporations are only on top because the playing field has become tilted in their direction. They are not skilled or competitive enough to survive otherwise.\n\nHuge corporations tend to have such a shocking advantage that people feel they should contribute more to the playing field that sustains them.

So you could just be silent or say \"I'm not answering that\" if someone asks crude or obscene questions.\n\nPeople who knew they would be caught - not a question of if, but when - would be far less likely to commit crimes like theft or premeditated physical attacks. Crimes of passion would still occur, but rarely.\n\nFalse accusations would disappear instantly. The justice system could no longer convict anyone who did not deserve it, barring exceptionally rare circumstances (like amnesia). Police forces would instantly be cleaned up, as no one could abuse their power and pretend they didn't. \n\nThe political system would be reformed, as politicians would no longer be able to accept bribes or do other actions that are illegal. It would become impossible to propose laws or programs and lie about your reasons, making it much more difficult to pass laws or programs that would be against the public interest. \n\nPeople would have much less ability to harm each other. Relationships would become much better as dishonest people would no longer be able to lie. \n\nIt is true that this would do nothing to solve issues like pollution, climate change, or homelessness. However, making a world where no one could lie to each other, or escape detection when harming someone else, would do an immense amount of good - perhaps more than any other potential development.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
