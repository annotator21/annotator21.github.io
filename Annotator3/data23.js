It is not objective or factual, it does not deal in truth - it only cares about relativistic, subjective matters like feelings, experiences, etc. (Pretty much all its statements have been proven wrong, eg. about the pay gap, the false stats about violence, etc.) And it is a part of critical theory, which is explicitly unscientific, and basically just a marxist method to criticize anything from a postmodern standpoint. Again, it's subjective, relativistic, it's based on anyone's idea about 'social justice'. This is exactly the problem. Society was reasonable and demanded objectivity all around - but not anymore.

Here's another [source](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-still-under-construction/index.shtml) too.

Not everyone matures at the same rate, some take longer than others. Some teenagers are really mature for their age while others struggle, while some are in between (the people in the middle are the majority, they do well enough to get by). Some are dealing with things such a poverty and violence in their homes that make it more difficult to succeed in school. Some just don't care about school. Some are extremely motivated to do great in school. Some have extremely supportive parents that push them to do well, while others have parents that couldn't care less. Honestly there are way too factors that contribute to success in school to list here. Environmental, social, biological, and individual personality traits are all factors to consider when talking about success in school.\n\nMy point still stands though I think, you shouldn't be punished for the rest of your life for stupid decisions you made when you were 16. Any child psychologist you ask would agree. \n\nAnd let's be honest, it's not hard to graduate from high school, that's a big reason why the majority get by.

Most applications for jobs ask you to specifically name your high school and what you graduated with, or to list if it's a GED. There might be some locations where there isn't standard, but in most states they want to know where you attended school and what you graduated with. Just knowing the name of  the high school itself is enough to tell-- outside of the fact that many alternative high schools have \"alternative\" in their name, most employers who are actively hiring high school graduates know about the local schools.  Most applications want to know if you received a GED instead.  I know employers who absolutely would pass over GED and alternative graduates in favor of regular graduates.\n\n2. This is probably regional/depending on the time, but when I was in high school, you couldn't join most of the military branches with anything less than a regular high school diploma. GEDs couldn't join most of them. Maybe alternative school graduates could, but GEDs could not. That fact was what kept a couple people I knew in school (as they wanted to join the Marines). But, again, this might be something that varies based on time, recruiter, etc.\n\n3. Those who are preparing to graduate from high school are likely already on a better path, while those in alternative high school/GED are, just in itself, struggling to find the better path. Most of my friends after high school graduation went to good colleges, typically with scholarships, whereas those with anything less were just getting regular jobs or attending a local community colleges or state universities (but definitely not on any scholarship).   As far as higher learning is concerned, those with regular high school degrees will likely do better than those with alternative or GEDs, thus receiving better grades, more opportunities for scholarships, jobs, etc.\n\nSo they aren't hurting regular high school graduates. Moreover, without options like alternative schools, you'd have more crime.  If those who were kicked out from behavioral issues, or pregnancy, or various other issues had no other options, they'll be more likely to get into drugs and/or legal trouble--which hurts us all.  Keeping them in school is beneficial for society.\n\nhttp://www.ncpc.org/topics/school-safety/strategies/strategy-alternative-high-schools\n\nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/works/chapter5.htm\n\nIn addition, alternative schools help regular students since it allows the schools to remove those causing disruptions to the class/other students. For me, this is what made high school much better than junior high. In junior high, there were plenty of delinquents who just made life hell for so many other regular students, but the school really had no better remedy outside of laughable detentions and pointless write-ups. They continued to stay in school, disrupting classes, bullying, etc. But in high school, those kids all ended up in the alternative school real quick, which made the classroom and overall school environment so much better for the rest of us.  Alternative schools were a win/win: the school districts continued to get their seat time (which meant they received more funding), we had a more pleasant school environment, and those in the alternative school were given a second chance and a more focused learning environment which often got them on a better path.

If you send something like \"hey what's up?\" or \"how are you?\" it's not going to work because that's BORING. \n\nTry being creative and sending a message the asks for a response.

That's what online dating is about. \n\nI have other friends who are way better looking than me but suck at online because they're not creative or funny. \n\nYou are coming at this from the view point of a male, where you look at girls for their looks. Girls are so inundated with offers from men that looks quickly become less meaningful. They need something more because to a girl with a lot of offers looks are a dime a dozen. She also knows unless you have a KILLER body you didn't work for your looks. \n\nNow, she may swipe right or five star you because of looks, but you won't get passed the first message without some personalty. \n\nThe last few girls I matched with on Tinder told me they swyped right because even though they couldn't see my fave (it's kind of a shitty picture) they really liked my shirt. They had no idea how tall I was, could barlley make out my complexion, and just liked me based off my shirt. \n\nThe same goes for any guy.

There is nothing to feel bad about if someone feels this way about you either. \n\nIt seems to me that women are told to perceive this as an offense. For instance if a stranger approached me and said \"hey, I find you very attractive, want to have sex?\" being very insulted would seem like an appropriate reaction for me. I don't think that makes any sense at all. \n\n\nThis can be a problem though, depending on the circumstance, so of course context plays a role. Some main examples of when this is a problem:\n\na) there is a reasonable expectation that the person in question should be interested in you for something else. If your mentor in the university or your employer or your parent or your doctor is only interested in you for sex, I don't have to explain why this would be a huge problem.\n\nb) the person interested in you for sex is being pushy about it and doesn't accept that you aren't interested. Of course you don't have to share that interest and they should then let it go.\n\nc) the person is attempting to get closer to you by deliberately pretenting they are interested in something else, thereby creating the situation a). For instance, someone acting like they want to hire you because you are very capable and then it turns out they just wanted you to have sex with them.\n\nd) the person expresses their interest in an obviously inappropriate time and situation. Like, on a funeral or in the middle of your date with your so.\n\nBut these don't affect my view because my view only deals with the insult coming from the fact a person is only interested in sexual part of you. similar examples can be used for any number of things and stem from some form of inappropriateness and not sex itself.\n\nOther than that, the idea that there are some people who see you and don't care about anything more from you than the possibility of sex isn't anything to feel angry about. If they weren't physically attracted to you they would likely not be interested at all, so it isn't like their interest in sex is taking away from potentally more meaningful relationship (in fact if they would be interested in something else as well, but are also interested in sex, one doesn't take from the other.)\n\nOnce back when I was in school we watched a video in psychology where a guy approached about 20 different women asking them if they want sex with him (he was actually attractive, maybe 8) and they all declined and most of them were pretty angry. Then a woman (imo, less attractive than a guy but it doesn't matter) approached about 20 men. Not only did the most agree, but those who didn't were very polite about it \"oh, Im sorry but I am married, thanks for asking\" and similar answers. Very shocking difference in responses. I am not interested in the part where some declined and some accepted, but rather in the way they took it. For men it was always a compliment, for women, almost always (some did find it funny) an offense.\n\nAlso when that catcalling video was posted and on many discussions after, girls pointed out how it is offensive to know that someoen is only interested in your body and approaching you for sex. Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn't the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren't interested? Or even if you just don't respond at all, like you wouldn't every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn't warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn't understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\n\n\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women. Why can most men accept the idea of being objectified and not have it be important, perhaps just a nice compliment. And when it happens to women it becomes a huge issue, it becomes about someone taking away from your very humanity, reducing you to an object etc. \n\nWhy would I think a stranger or acquaitance has such power over me that the mere fact they only care about my body reduces me to anything objectively? Why would I not feel enough basic confidence in the fact that I am a person (a very small thing to feel confident about) that this becomes only a compliment of one of my attributes?\n\nI am not sure if i am articulating this second part well, but it is something that has been bothering me for a while. I just think it would be much healthier if a non threatening expression of purely sexual interest isn't treated like anything negative - because it isn't negative. It's neutral to positive, depending on what you take from it.\n\n\nEDIT: I just want to include this part of my response from the comments because I think it is relevant to what I was trying to say in the second part.\n\nThe huge problem here for me is the assumption that somebody being interested in one specific thing from you (which let's face it is the case in most human interactions unless with people close to us, and only seen as an issue when its this specific case) actually has the power to take away your complexity. It propagates the idea that being interested in your body takes the value off other things about you in general. It promotes almost pathological and irrational insecurity and a weird need for affirmation from men.

I guess I'd still say I disagree with it, I am just curious why you think that? I sort of see things as the opposite, that women are dealing with some identity crisis and weird attitude towards sex. \n\ni think sex really can just be sex. I don't think men are sex obsessed, just that in most male circles sex isn't an extremely sensitive topic, and expressing sexuality and desire for just sex is seen as fine. MAny men also don't like one night stands, but those who do, or those who simply like expressing interest in women on purely physical basis aren't overthinking it because there are no additional meanings attached. \n\n\nI think for women, there is one mentality encouraging fear of sex and male sexuality, and seeing it as vulgar and offensive, result of which is repressing the similar sexuality in themselves. There is some view that a woman is deeper or more emotional with sex that we all hear our whole lives, and I think many just naturally end up acting on it. But then there is also the whole sex positive thing going on, and women want to be sexy but then end up also confused thinking whether if they are objects of sexual attraction it means they are worthless otherwise, and feel bad for liking it and it all ends up being a really complicated mess of trying to be something and reading too much into simple things. \n\ni know how wrong this sounds, but I think women should really stop and think how a man would react to something, or if a man would see something as an issue, and ask themselves why not and why should they? Not because men are sex obsessed pigs, just because they grew up with a healthier and less complicated attitude towards sex related things. \n\nNExt step shouldn't be for men to stop any sexual objectification of women - which is natural in many contexts, but rather for women to start acting the same with men.

I guess I'd still say I disagree with it, I am just curious why you think that? I sort of see things as the opposite, that women are dealing with some identity crisis and weird attitude towards sex. \n\ni think sex really can just be sex. I don't think men are sex obsessed, just that in most male circles sex isn't an extremely sensitive topic, and expressing sexuality and desire for just sex is seen as fine. MAny men also don't like one night stands, but those who do, or those who simply like expressing interest in women on purely physical basis aren't overthinking it because there are no additional meanings attached. \n\n\nI think for women, there is one mentality encouraging fear of sex and male sexuality, and seeing it as vulgar and offensive, result of which is repressing the similar sexuality in themselves. There is some view that a woman is deeper or more emotional with sex that we all hear our whole lives, and I think many just naturally end up acting on it. But then there is also the whole sex positive thing going on, and women want to be sexy but then end up also confused thinking whether if they are objects of sexual attraction it means they are worthless otherwise, and feel bad for liking it and it all ends up being a really complicated mess of trying to be something and reading too much into simple things. \n\ni know how wrong this sounds, but I think women should really stop and think how a man would react to something, or if a man would see something as an issue, and ask themselves why not and why should they? Not because men are sex obsessed pigs, just because they grew up with a healthier and less complicated attitude towards sex related things. \n\nNExt step shouldn't be for men to stop any sexual objectification of women - which is natural in many contexts, but rather for women to start acting the same with men.

"}, {"id": "2n5564", "body": "There is nothing wrong or insulting with wanting to have sex with  someone and only being interested in a human being for sex. There is nothing to feel bad about if someone feels this way about you either. \n\nIt seems to me that women are told to perceive this as an offense. For instance if a stranger approached me and said \"hey, I find you very attractive, want to have sex?\" being very insulted would seem like an appropriate reaction for me. I don't think that makes any sense at all. \n\n\nThis can be a problem though, depending on the circumstance, so of course context plays a role. Some main examples of when this is a problem:\n\na) there is a reasonable expectation that the person in question should be interested in you for something else. If your mentor in the university or your employer or your parent or your doctor is only interested in you for sex, I don't have to explain why this would be a huge problem.\n\nb) the person interested in you for sex is being pushy about it and doesn't accept that you aren't interested. Of course you don't have to share that interest and they should then let it go.\n\nc) the person is attempting to get closer to you by deliberately pretenting they are interested in something else, thereby creating the situation a). For instance, someone acting like they want to hire you because you are very capable and then it turns out they just wanted you to have sex with them.\n\nd) the person expresses their interest in an obviously inappropriate time and situation. Like, on a funeral or in the middle of your date with your so.\n\nBut these don't affect my view because my view only deals with the insult coming from the fact a person is only interested in sexual part of you. similar examples can be used for any number of things and stem from some form of inappropriateness and not sex itself.\n\nOther than that, the idea that there are some people who see you and don't care about anything more from you than the possibility of sex isn't anything to feel angry about. If they weren't physically attracted to you they would likely not be interested at all, so it isn't like their interest in sex is taking away from potentally more meaningful relationship (in fact if they would be interested in something else as well, but are also interested in sex, one doesn't take from the other.)\n\nOnce back when I was in school we watched a video in psychology where a guy approached about 20 different women asking them if they want sex with him (he was actually attractive, maybe 8) and they all declined and most of them were pretty angry. Then a woman (imo, less attractive than a guy but it doesn't matter) approached about 20 men. Not only did the most agree, but those who didn't were very polite about it \"oh, Im sorry but I am married, thanks for asking\" and similar answers. Very shocking difference in responses. I am not interested in the part where some declined and some accepted, but rather in the way they took it. For men it was always a compliment, for women, almost always (some did find it funny) an offense.\n\nAlso when that catcalling video was posted and on many discussions after, girls pointed out how it is offensive to know that someoen is only interested in your body and approaching you for sex. Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn't the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren't interested? Or even if you just don't respond at all, like you wouldn't every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn't warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn't understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\n\n\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women. Why can most men accept the idea of being objectified and not have it be important, perhaps just a nice compliment. And when it happens to women it becomes a huge issue, it becomes about someone taking away from your very humanity, reducing you to an object etc. \n\nWhy would I think a stranger or acquaitance has such power over me that the mere fact they only care about my body reduces me to anything objectively? Why would I not feel enough basic confidence in the fact that I am a person (a very small thing to feel confident about) that this becomes only a compliment of one of my attributes?\n\nI am not sure if i am articulating this second part well, but it is something that has been bothering me for a while. I just think it would be much healthier if a non threatening expression of purely sexual interest isn't treated like anything negative - because it isn't negative. It's neutral to positive, depending on what you take from it.\n\n\nEDIT: I just want to include this part of my response from the comments because I think it is relevant to what I was trying to say in the second part.\n\nThe huge problem here for me is the assumption that somebody being interested in one specific thing from you (which let's face it is the case in most human interactions unless with people close to us, and only seen as an issue when its this specific case) actually has the power to take away your complexity. It propagates the idea that being interested in your body takes the value off other things about you in general. It promotes almost pathological and irrational insecurity and a weird need for affirmation from men.

I don't think there is an objective truth or way things should be, whatever works. If I am a person who thinks sex is a casual physical activity, I am not insulting a different person by asking for sex, they can decline it. Of course pushiness is an issue but I addressed that.

The first point, about whether sex should be casual or intimate, I think that is very dependent on the person. I don't think there is an objective truth or way things should be, whatever works.

Remember my example where people expect one to profit from the experience of free working, but they actually don't ?\n\nFact is that only 20 percent of women reach orgasm [consistently](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/200903/the-most-important-sexual-statistic).  The statistics vary a lot on whether it's vaginal intercourse etc. and how many women never have reached any orgasm in their life at all etc... But you get the point. It's not close to an equal experience. Now for those 20 percent, casual intercourse might be a not too bad idea. However for the rest it's a different story. \nDon't get me wrong. Women like sex too. Sex is a great mean of communication between two loving partners and shared intimacy is a great thing in a relationship even without orgasming, but it's a different story when it's a one night stand. Not to mention that a men might focus more on his own pleasure than that of his partner if it's a one night stand than it is the case in an ongoing relationship. And also that a woman's orgasm may depend on the psychological component more than a men.\n\nWould you still love to have casual sex with strangers if you'd could only reach orgasm one of ten times while the other nine times you'd barely feel a thing? Maybe not so much. \n\nJust as in my example where the graphic designer won't actually gain any \"precious experience\" or fun from working for you that offended woman is might also be offended because she knows that she won't get even close as much pleasure as you think she will. She knows it will actually be quite one sided just as the graphic designer does.\n\nNow again. That doesn't go for all women. Women usually don't hate sex. And there are also many who enjoy it even without having an orgasm. But for many more it only makes sense if it's not \"just sex and nothing else\" which is your point, but if it comes in a set with other pleasant factors (which aren't necessary a relationship). Just as there are many men for who casual sex is not an attractive option and just as there ARE women who react favorable to a men being solely interested in sex. But those aren't the people we're talking about, are we?\n\nAnother factor which adds to the inequality is the unbalance in health risks, namely getting pregnant. No matter how well you contracept, pregnancy scares happen and might have very real health consequences. In the case of casual sex the woman is more likely to bear the consequences alone. I won't go into detail in other risks like possible violence..\n\nAnd third. Like I mentioned before it does imply of being sexually promiscuous. You've mentioned that progressive women should fight this and I agree with you and hope that it will change in the future. But the thing is that right now the consequences of it are still very real. Women do get taunted for being easy both by their environment and also by potential relationship partners. Men have to deal with less negative reactions for \"sleeping\" around. In fact it tends to be considered a rather good thing by their peers. I hope it will change, but the reality of society vs wishful state can't be ignored.\n\nSo in summary it is an imbalanced experience where on average there are less benefits for the women, but more risks, both physical and social ones.\nUnfortunately it is therefore different from an invitation to a mutually equally enjoyed activity like tennis. \n\nSo my example with the professional working for free still stands. While the one proposing expects that the act will equally benefit the worker by giving him experience etc.. and the implication of it doing might even be insulting for the average specialist. If you don't believe me, just visit some IT subreddit with people complaining about people asking them to fix their PC for free. They don't take it as a simple yes/no proposal either unless there are other factors involved.  \n\nAccording to the statistic I've cited, it is an invitation to an unequal experience to 80% of women. Other statistics might vary, but the majority of women don't orgasm on a regular basis as the average men.  I hope it is understandable how this fact is correlated to the way women feel about the expression of sex-only interests.

There is nothing to feel bad about if someone feels this way about you either. \n\nIt seems to me that women are told to perceive this as an offense. For instance if a stranger approached me and said \"hey, I find you very attractive, want to have sex?\" being very insulted would seem like an appropriate reaction for me. I don't think that makes any sense at all. \n\n\nThis can be a problem though, depending on the circumstance, so of course context plays a role. Some main examples of when this is a problem:\n\na) there is a reasonable expectation that the person in question should be interested in you for something else. If your mentor in the university or your employer or your parent or your doctor is only interested in you for sex, I don't have to explain why this would be a huge problem.\n\nb) the person interested in you for sex is being pushy about it and doesn't accept that you aren't interested. Of course you don't have to share that interest and they should then let it go.\n\nc) the person is attempting to get closer to you by deliberately pretenting they are interested in something else, thereby creating the situation a). For instance, someone acting like they want to hire you because you are very capable and then it turns out they just wanted you to have sex with them.\n\nd) the person expresses their interest in an obviously inappropriate time and situation. Like, on a funeral or in the middle of your date with your so.\n\nBut these don't affect my view because my view only deals with the insult coming from the fact a person is only interested in sexual part of you. similar examples can be used for any number of things and stem from some form of inappropriateness and not sex itself.\n\nOther than that, the idea that there are some people who see you and don't care about anything more from you than the possibility of sex isn't anything to feel angry about. If they weren't physically attracted to you they would likely not be interested at all, so it isn't like their interest in sex is taking away from potentally more meaningful relationship (in fact if they would be interested in something else as well, but are also interested in sex, one doesn't take from the other.)\n\nOnce back when I was in school we watched a video in psychology where a guy approached about 20 different women asking them if they want sex with him (he was actually attractive, maybe 8) and they all declined and most of them were pretty angry. Then a woman (imo, less attractive than a guy but it doesn't matter) approached about 20 men. Not only did the most agree, but those who didn't were very polite about it \"oh, Im sorry but I am married, thanks for asking\" and similar answers. Very shocking difference in responses. I am not interested in the part where some declined and some accepted, but rather in the way they took it. For men it was always a compliment, for women, almost always (some did find it funny) an offense.\n\nAlso when that catcalling video was posted and on many discussions after, girls pointed out how it is offensive to know that someoen is only interested in your body and approaching you for sex. Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn't the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren't interested? Or even if you just don't respond at all, like you wouldn't every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn't warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn't understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\n\n\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women. Why can most men accept the idea of being objectified and not have it be important, perhaps just a nice compliment. And when it happens to women it becomes a huge issue, it becomes about someone taking away from your very humanity, reducing you to an object etc. \n\nWhy would I think a stranger or acquaitance has such power over me that the mere fact they only care about my body reduces me to anything objectively? Why would I not feel enough basic confidence in the fact that I am a person (a very small thing to feel confident about) that this becomes only a compliment of one of my attributes?\n\nI am not sure if i am articulating this second part well, but it is something that has been bothering me for a while. I just think it would be much healthier if a non threatening expression of purely sexual interest isn't treated like anything negative - because it isn't negative. It's neutral to positive, depending on what you take from it.\n\n\nEDIT: I just want to include this part of my response from the comments because I think it is relevant to what I was trying to say in the second part.\n\nThe huge problem here for me is the assumption that somebody being interested in one specific thing from you (which let's face it is the case in most human interactions unless with people close to us, and only seen as an issue when its this specific case) actually has the power to take away your complexity.

Some main examples of when this is a problem:\n\na) there is a reasonable expectation that the person in question should be interested in you for something else. If your mentor in the university or your employer or your parent or your doctor is only interested in you for sex, I don't have to explain why this would be a huge problem.\n\nb) the person interested in you for sex is being pushy about it and doesn't accept that you aren't interested. Of course you don't have to share that interest and they should then let it go.\n\nc) the person is attempting to get closer to you by deliberately pretenting they are interested in something else, thereby creating the situation a). For instance, someone acting like they want to hire you because you are very capable and then it turns out they just wanted you to have sex with them.\n\nd) the person expresses their interest in an obviously inappropriate time and situation. Like, on a funeral or in the middle of your date with your so.\n\nBut these don't affect my view because my view only deals with the insult coming from the fact a person is only interested in sexual part of you. similar examples can be used for any number of things and stem from some form of inappropriateness and not sex itself.\n\nOther than that, the idea that there are some people who see you and don't care about anything more from you than the possibility of sex isn't anything to feel angry about. If they weren't physically attracted to you they would likely not be interested at all, so it isn't like their interest in sex is taking away from potentally more meaningful relationship (in fact if they would be interested in something else as well, but are also interested in sex, one doesn't take from the other.)\n\nOnce back when I was in school we watched a video in psychology where a guy approached about 20 different women asking them if they want sex with him (he was actually attractive, maybe 8) and they all declined and most of them were pretty angry. Then a woman (imo, less attractive than a guy but it doesn't matter) approached about 20 men. Not only did the most agree, but those who didn't were very polite about it \"oh, Im sorry but I am married, thanks for asking\" and similar answers. Very shocking difference in responses. I am not interested in the part where some declined and some accepted, but rather in the way they took it. For men it was always a compliment, for women, almost always (some did find it funny) an offense.\n\nAlso when that catcalling video was posted and on many discussions after, girls pointed out how it is offensive to know that someoen is only interested in your body and approaching you for sex. Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn't the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren't interested? Or even if you just don't respond at all, like you wouldn't every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn't warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn't understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\n\n\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women.

There is nothing to feel bad about if someone feels this way about you either. \n\nIt seems to me that women are told to perceive this as an offense. For instance if a stranger approached me and said \"hey, I find you very attractive, want to have sex?\" being very insulted would seem like an appropriate reaction for me. I don't think that makes any sense at all. \n\n\nThis can be a problem though, depending on the circumstance, so of course context plays a role. Some main examples of when this is a problem:\n\na) there is a reasonable expectation that the person in question should be interested in you for something else. If your mentor in the university or your employer or your parent or your doctor is only interested in you for sex, I don't have to explain why this would be a huge problem.\n\nb) the person interested in you for sex is being pushy about it and doesn't accept that you aren't interested. Of course you don't have to share that interest and they should then let it go.\n\nc) the person is attempting to get closer to you by deliberately pretenting they are interested in something else, thereby creating the situation a). For instance, someone acting like they want to hire you because you are very capable and then it turns out they just wanted you to have sex with them.\n\nd) the person expresses their interest in an obviously inappropriate time and situation. Like, on a funeral or in the middle of your date with your so.\n\nBut these don't affect my view because my view only deals with the insult coming from the fact a person is only interested in sexual part of you. similar examples can be used for any number of things and stem from some form of inappropriateness and not sex itself.\n\nOther than that, the idea that there are some people who see you and don't care about anything more from you than the possibility of sex isn't anything to feel angry about. If they weren't physically attracted to you they would likely not be interested at all, so it isn't like their interest in sex is taking away from potentally more meaningful relationship (in fact if they would be interested in something else as well, but are also interested in sex, one doesn't take from the other.)\n\nOnce back when I was in school we watched a video in psychology where a guy approached about 20 different women asking them if they want sex with him (he was actually attractive, maybe 8) and they all declined and most of them were pretty angry. Then a woman (imo, less attractive than a guy but it doesn't matter) approached about 20 men. Not only did the most agree, but those who didn't were very polite about it \"oh, Im sorry but I am married, thanks for asking\" and similar answers. Very shocking difference in responses. I am not interested in the part where some declined and some accepted, but rather in the way they took it. For men it was always a compliment, for women, almost always (some did find it funny) an offense.\n\nAlso when that catcalling video was posted and on many discussions after, girls pointed out how it is offensive to know that someoen is only interested in your body and approaching you for sex. Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn't the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren't interested? Or even if you just don't respond at all, like you wouldn't every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn't warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn't understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\n\n\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women. Why can most men accept the idea of being objectified and not have it be important, perhaps just a nice compliment. And when it happens to women it becomes a huge issue, it becomes about someone taking away from your very humanity, reducing you to an object etc. \n\nWhy would I think a stranger or acquaitance has such power over me that the mere fact they only care about my body reduces me to anything objectively? Why would I not feel enough basic confidence in the fact that I am a person (a very small thing to feel confident about) that this becomes only a compliment of one of my attributes?\n\nI am not sure if i am articulating this second part well, but it is something that has been bothering me for a while. I just think it would be much healthier if a non threatening expression of purely sexual interest isn't treated like anything negative - because it isn't negative. It's neutral to positive, depending on what you take from it.\n\n\nEDIT: I just want to include this part of my response from the comments because I think it is relevant to what I was trying to say in the second part.\n\nThe huge problem here for me is the assumption that somebody being interested in one specific thing from you (which let's face it is the case in most human interactions unless with people close to us, and only seen as an issue when its this specific case) actually has the power to take away your complexity. It propagates the idea that being interested in your body takes the value off other things about you in general. It promotes almost pathological and irrational insecurity and a weird need for affirmation from men.

"}, {"id": "2n5564", "body": "There is nothing wrong or insulting with wanting to have sex with  someone and only being interested in a human being for sex. There is nothing to feel bad about if someone feels this way about you either. \n\nIt seems to me that women are told to perceive this as an offense. For instance if a stranger approached me and said \"hey, I find you very attractive, want to have sex?\" being very insulted would seem like an appropriate reaction for me. I don't think that makes any sense at all. \n\n\nThis can be a problem though, depending on the circumstance, so of course context plays a role. Some main examples of when this is a problem:\n\na) there is a reasonable expectation that the person in question should be interested in you for something else. If your mentor in the university or your employer or your parent or your doctor is only interested in you for sex, I don't have to explain why this would be a huge problem.\n\nb) the person interested in you for sex is being pushy about it and doesn't accept that you aren't interested. Of course you don't have to share that interest and they should then let it go.\n\nc) the person is attempting to get closer to you by deliberately pretenting they are interested in something else, thereby creating the situation a). For instance, someone acting like they want to hire you because you are very capable and then it turns out they just wanted you to have sex with them.\n\nd) the person expresses their interest in an obviously inappropriate time and situation. Like, on a funeral or in the middle of your date with your so.\n\nBut these don't affect my view because my view only deals with the insult coming from the fact a person is only interested in sexual part of you. similar examples can be used for any number of things and stem from some form of inappropriateness and not sex itself.\n\nOther than that, the idea that there are some people who see you and don't care about anything more from you than the possibility of sex isn't anything to feel angry about. If they weren't physically attracted to you they would likely not be interested at all, so it isn't like their interest in sex is taking away from potentally more meaningful relationship (in fact if they would be interested in something else as well, but are also interested in sex, one doesn't take from the other.)\n\nOnce back when I was in school we watched a video in psychology where a guy approached about 20 different women asking them if they want sex with him (he was actually attractive, maybe 8) and they all declined and most of them were pretty angry. Then a woman (imo, less attractive than a guy but it doesn't matter) approached about 20 men. Not only did the most agree, but those who didn't were very polite about it \"oh, Im sorry but I am married, thanks for asking\" and similar answers. Very shocking difference in responses. I am not interested in the part where some declined and some accepted, but rather in the way they took it. For men it was always a compliment, for women, almost always (some did find it funny) an offense.\n\nAlso when that catcalling video was posted and on many discussions after, girls pointed out how it is offensive to know that someoen is only interested in your body and approaching you for sex. Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn't the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren't interested? Or even if you just don't respond at all, like you wouldn't every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn't warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn't understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\n\n\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women. Why can most men accept the idea of being objectified and not have it be important, perhaps just a nice compliment. And when it happens to women it becomes a huge issue, it becomes about someone taking away from your very humanity, reducing you to an object etc. \n\nWhy would I think a stranger or acquaitance has such power over me that the mere fact they only care about my body reduces me to anything objectively? Why would I not feel enough basic confidence in the fact that I am a person (a very small thing to feel confident about) that this becomes only a compliment of one of my attributes?\n\nI am not sure if i am articulating this second part well, but it is something that has been bothering me for a while. I just think it would be much healthier if a non threatening expression of purely sexual interest isn't treated like anything negative - because it isn't negative. It's neutral to positive, depending on what you take from it.\n\n\nEDIT: I just want to include this part of my response from the comments because I think it is relevant to what I was trying to say in the second part.\n\nThe huge problem here for me is the assumption that somebody being interested in one specific thing from you (which let's face it is the case in most human interactions unless with people close to us, and only seen as an issue when its this specific case) actually has the power to take away your complexity. It propagates the idea that being interested in your body takes the value off other things about you in general. It promotes almost pathological and irrational insecurity and a weird need for affirmation from men.

Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn't the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren't interested? Or even if you just don't respond at all, like you wouldn't every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn't warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn't understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\n\n\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women.

Even though the vast majority of interracial crime is black-on-white. In fact, interracial crime, in and of itself, is an example of discrimination against white men.

But I think we can all agree that waiting until the Statute of Limitations has passed is pretty counter-productive. It's unreasonable for ANY woman to do that.  For ALL of them to calls their motives into question.  Waiting is the main reason they are not being believed. So it's not a matter of STILL not believing them.  If they'd have ran screaming from his hotel room on the day that the incident took place, straight to a police station or ER, and drugs, bruises, and Bill Cosby's semen were documented, THEN enough people would believe them to at least prevent him from doing it again.\n\nAs far as paying for sex, well, being as that the ONLY difference between rape and consentual sex is whether or not the woman consented, then yes, there probably is a number; a number that most women have in the back of their mind but wouldn't care to admit.  $500?  $5,000?   $5 Million?  Maybe just $50, if it's a matter of failing to pay a street prostitute.  But yes, a cash payment can, and often does, spell the difference between rape and consensual sex. \n\nIf Ignorance of the law is no excuse, all parents of children who grow up to be my age should be locked up for failing to transport their kids in approved car safety seats.  The fact  that they didn't know that someday it would be illegal is not an excuse!\n\nNot responding at all to the allegations does show a possibility of some mental issues.  He used to be very quick witted.  One would expect a response like \"I'm not here to talk about that today, but my new project with NBC is very exciting....\" or \"You know, when you're rich and famous, people come out of the wordwork  to say bad things about you...\"  Shaking his head \"no\"---on a radio program--is something that a seasoned professional rarely does. \n\n\"Stop and Frisk\" is a GOOD thing.  Racial profiling, when good reasons exist for it, is not the same as \"being discriminated against\".  I want cops to do appropriate profiling for the same reason I want the TSA to scrutinize the muslim men boarding my plane, rather than mexican grandmothers and white babies.\n\nRacism against white men:  \"Affirmative Action\"; and also, the fact that white men can be charged with \"hate crimes\" against african americans, but it just doesn't happen the other way around.  Even though the vast majority of interracial crime is black-on-white. In fact, interracial crime, in and of itself, is an example of discrimination against white men.  As is the vandalism and looting currently taking place in Ferguson (which also will not be charged as \"hate crimes\", even though there is no better example of hate crime than that.)"}, {"id": "cmcu55x", "body": "&gt; But it was SO incredibly biased and one-sided, that it was hard to take it seriously.\n\nOr you could actually address the arguments that were made by the article.....\n\n&gt; But I think we can all agree that waiting until the Statute of Limitations has passed is pretty counter-productive. It's unreasonable for ANY woman to do that.\n\nIt's unreasonable to expect a prosecution and for him to be jailed if they waited until after the statute of limitations sure. I disagree that it's unreasonable for a woman to come forward that something happened to her that long ago though. Women not coming forward about rape or sexual assault out of fear of not being believed *is exceedingly common* and the general response is to hopefully put it all behind them. If others come forward years later and that causes people to be more comfortable to come out and speak about this, that makes a lot of sense. Waiting like they did when they all had good reason is not a reason to not believe them.\n\n&gt; If they'd have ran screaming from his hotel room on the day that the incident took place, straight to a police station or ER, and drugs, bruises, and Bill Cosby's semen were documented, THEN enough people would believe them to at least prevent him from doing it again.\n\nYou don't really understand the way rape affects someone, there's Rape Trauma Syndrome and the idea that they would not be believed or that he may retaliate some how. Sure, that would be great if they did this, but the fact that they didn't is not evidence they are lying.\n\n&gt; $500? $5,000? $5 Million? Maybe just $50, if it's a matter of failing to pay a street prostitute. But yes, a cash payment can, and often does, spell the difference between rape and consensual sex.\n\nNo. A cash payment is never the difference between rape and consensual sex. A cash payment can be the difference between a woman consenting or not, but if you go through with having sex with her against her consent then it doesn't matter how much money you give her (not pay, because she wasn't selling anything) you still had sex with her against her will and thus it is rape. If I rape someone and then hand them $5 million dollars, they may not report the rape out of fear of not being believed or otherwise, but I still raped them and the money doesn't change that.\n\n&gt; If Ignorance of the law is no excuse, all parents of children who grow up to be my age should be locked up for failing to transport their kids in approved car safety seats. The fact that they didn't know that someday it would be illegal is not an excuse!\n\nWhat? Rape was still illegal back then. Drugging a woman (seems he was using roofies or another similar drug) and then having sex with her while she is unconscious was still rape on the books back then. Not to mention that since we're not discussing actually having him arrested or prosecuted, it doesn't matter at all what the law says in this scenario. \n\n&gt; \"Stop and Frisk\" is a GOOD thing. Racial profiling, when good reasons exist for it, is not the same as \"being discriminated against\".\n\nNo. \"Stop And Frisk\" was a demonstrably terrible policy which did nothing but put young minorities into jail for non-violent drug possession at a higher rate than white people who actually used drugs. The result was a disenfranchisement and discrimination against minorities. There was no reason for the profiling in this case because *black people do not use drugs at a higher rate than white people, in fact the opposite is true*. Racial profiling **is never a fucking appropriate thing** because then you completely miss the people who are actually committing the crimes and disproportionately target a race which is already oppressed and discrminated against, further discriminating against them.\n\n&gt; Racism against white men: \"Affirmative Action\";\n\nNo. Affirmative Action is not racism against white men. That's not how racism nor Affirmative Action work.\n\n&gt;  the fact that white men can be charged with \"hate crimes\" against african americans, but it just doesn't happen the other way around. \n\nThe law completely allows for it to happen the other way around. It just so happens that Black people don't tend to attack white people *just because they are white* very often nor with the intention of terrorizing a community like the way that white people attack black people. This is also not racism against white people.\n\n&gt; In fact, interracial crime, in and of itself, is an example of discrimination against white men.\n\nWhat? How is interracial crime, in and of itself, discrimination against white men? \n\n&gt; As is the vandalism and looting currently taking place in Ferguson (which also will not be charged as \"hate crimes\", even though there is no better example of hate crime than that.)\n\nFirst of all, the only people who are claiming that it is the protestors themselves doing the looting are the police which have a very good reason to be biased in this respect. Next, how the hell are these hate crimes? They are specifically protesting against racism and discrimination. They are not trying to \"Terrorize\" the white community, nor are they displaying hate of people \"for being white\".

One of my peers believes this guy is a con-man just trying to get your money. However, I personally have felt more power from attempting Mr.Alan Roger Currie's mode one approach since attachment has been eliminated from my interactions. Can I say, I have had results yet? No, but my attitude feels more better when approaching women with my desires rather then trying to play the \"nice guy\" role, which has labeled my as a creepy person where as mode-one just pins me down as a jerk. Now out of the two from my and Mr.Currie's anecdotal experiences the latter actually gets results in general compared to the former. However, I have only applied mode-one for about a month and I am doing a few approaches so far since I've been busy being a college student trying to graduate. Also, my intentions have been the desire to exchange orgasms with women within our first date in the future. So, of course this intention will get the most blow outs when compared to other ones us men desire such as getting in a relationship, wanting to be platonic friends, or proposing marriage.\n\nInitially I expect this debate to come down to subjectivity of experience; but, do not mind if we utilize scientific evidence on both sides to address our points.\n\nAgain, I look forward to see both counter arguments and pro-arguments to this issue.\n\nOh and P.S. I am not Alan Roger Currie just a fan of his books and hope he takes notice of this thread himself since his username is modeone4ever on reddit.\n\n-Peace.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
