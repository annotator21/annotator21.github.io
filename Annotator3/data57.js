While still in foster care, the state allowed a sexual reassignment surgery on the child. They removed his penis &amp; testicles. The child now identifies as male. His parents are suing the state.\n\nThe comments section on this post was overwhelmingly filled with rage against the state for performing what some term \"mutilation\" on this child, as well as countless comparisons to [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). I am baffled by the response to the article and disagree with the Reimer comparison, so I would like my view changed.\n\nFor starters, I think Reimer is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of so-called \"therapy\" that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals. But I don't see why that implies sex reassignment surgery on children is inherently evil.\n\nUnlike Reimer, this child was not born with a single sex and then reassigned to a different one.  He also wasn't forced into traumatic pseudoscientific behavioral therapy. From what I read, it sounds like he was raised like any normal girl would be. I think the comparisons to Reimer are an example of the Reddit hivemind desperately seeking comparisons for what they perceive to be medical malpractice.\n\nI'm certainly open to being convinced Reimer's case is relevant, but it's not the important part of my view.\n\nAs stated in the title, I don't see anything wrong with what the doctors in this case did. The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Let's look at some alternative scenarios.\n\nFirst, if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. It's functionally the same as if they had been born that way.\n\nIf the intersex child hadn't received surgery, he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male, female, or whatever, along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened, and it's what I disagree with.\n\nI can only speculate on what that life would be like (so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily) but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough, especially dealing with body and gender issues. I'm not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have been embarrassed about it if I were 12 years old and my genitals didn't look like anyone else's. And much as I think our society's gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened, it doesn't change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.\n\nWorst of all, I can't imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult (as a guy, the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific) or being stuck in a body you don't feel comfortable in.\n\nNote that in the case in question the child doesn't identify as intersex: he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals, he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF, but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth (so he had the option to become female later) rather than leaving him intersex.\n\nTherefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender ~~re~~assignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice, great. If they make the wrong choice, I'm no different from any other trans person.\n\nBy the way, I'm not saying intersex infants should *have* to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex, I guess that's their choice just like they're free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice, and if my parents did that I would be mad at them, but again I'm not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory. I'm just saying it's not inherently wrong to perform the surgery.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

It's becoming less common now, and I think that people's attitudes are changing a bit about circumcision as the default option. But circumcision is, as you say, a far cry from gender identity. I brought it up in the first place to point out that reluctance to consider your infant's future sex life is not acceptable, and this reluctance was something the researcher encountered in her work. My parents looked at their bouncing baby boy and fast-forwarded about 16 years to imagine his first encounter with a girl or guy and considered what the probable outcomes of being uncut in a cut world would be. Parents of intersex children have a much tougher road ahead--it's not just about what their kid's organs look like--it's which organ they have in the first place. In a world where it's much, much easier to create female sex characteristics than male sex characteristics, it makes more practical sense to cut some things off later (if necessary) than it does to try to form new organs out of tissue that's already been traumatized by infant surgery."}, {"id": "clz5w6n", "body": "Great response, thanks.\n\n&gt; As the article states, there was no medical reason the surgery had to be performed at that time.\n\nMedically it makes no difference when the surgery takes place.

"}, {"id": "2lxha7", "body": "This is inspired by [an article on TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2lvqfa/til_a_couple_were_in_the_process_of_adopting_a_1/) so I will quote that for starters:\n\n&gt; TIL a couple were in the process of adopting a 1 yr old intersexed child with both male &amp; female genitalia. While still in foster care, the state allowed a sexual reassignment surgery on the child. They removed his penis &amp; testicles. The child now identifies as male. His parents are suing the state.\n\nThe comments section on this post was overwhelmingly filled with rage against the state for performing what some term \"mutilation\" on this child, as well as countless comparisons to [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). I am baffled by the response to the article and disagree with the Reimer comparison, so I would like my view changed.\n\nFor starters, I think Reimer is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of so-called \"therapy\" that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals. But I don't see why that implies sex reassignment surgery on children is inherently evil.\n\nUnlike Reimer, this child was not born with a single sex and then reassigned to a different one.  He also wasn't forced into traumatic pseudoscientific behavioral therapy. From what I read, it sounds like he was raised like any normal girl would be. I think the comparisons to Reimer are an example of the Reddit hivemind desperately seeking comparisons for what they perceive to be medical malpractice.\n\nI'm certainly open to being convinced Reimer's case is relevant, but it's not the important part of my view.\n\nAs stated in the title, I don't see anything wrong with what the doctors in this case did. The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Let's look at some alternative scenarios.\n\nFirst, if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. It's functionally the same as if they had been born that way.\n\nIf the intersex child hadn't received surgery, he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male, female, or whatever, along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened, and it's what I disagree with.\n\nI can only speculate on what that life would be like (so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily) but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough, especially dealing with body and gender issues. I'm not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have been embarrassed about it if I were 12 years old and my genitals didn't look like anyone else's. And much as I think our society's gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened, it doesn't change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.\n\nWorst of all, I can't imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult (as a guy, the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific) or being stuck in a body you don't feel comfortable in.\n\nNote that in the case in question the child doesn't identify as intersex: he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals, he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF, but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth (so he had the option to become female later) rather than leaving him intersex.\n\nTherefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender ~~re~~assignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice, great. If they make the wrong choice, I'm no different from any other trans person.\n\nBy the way, I'm not saying intersex infants should *have* to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex, I guess that's their choice just like they're free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice, and if my parents did that I would be mad at them, but again I'm not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory. I'm just saying it's not inherently wrong to perform the surgery.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Let's look at some alternative scenarios.\n\nFirst, if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. It's functionally the same as if they had been born that way.\n\nIf the intersex child hadn't received surgery, he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male, female, or whatever, along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened, and it's what I disagree with.\n\nI can only speculate on what that life would be like (so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily) but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough, especially dealing with body and gender issues. I'm not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have been embarrassed about it if I were 12 years old and my genitals didn't look like anyone else's. And much as I think our society's gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened, it doesn't change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.\n\nWorst of all, I can't imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult (as a guy, the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific) or being stuck in a body you don't feel comfortable in.\n\nNote that in the case in question the child doesn't identify as intersex: he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals, he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF, but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth (so he had the option to become female later) rather than leaving him intersex.\n\nTherefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender ~~re~~assignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice, great. If they make the wrong choice, I'm no different from any other trans person.\n\nBy the way, I'm not saying intersex infants should *have* to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex, I guess that's their choice just like they're free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice, and if my parents did that I would be mad at them, but again I'm not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory.

While still in foster care, the state allowed a sexual reassignment surgery on the child. They removed his penis &amp; testicles. The child now identifies as male. His parents are suing the state.\n\nThe comments section on this post was overwhelmingly filled with rage against the state for performing what some term \"mutilation\" on this child, as well as countless comparisons to [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). I am baffled by the response to the article and disagree with the Reimer comparison, so I would like my view changed.\n\nFor starters, I think Reimer is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of so-called \"therapy\" that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals. But I don't see why that implies sex reassignment surgery on children is inherently evil.\n\nUnlike Reimer, this child was not born with a single sex and then reassigned to a different one.  He also wasn't forced into traumatic pseudoscientific behavioral therapy. From what I read, it sounds like he was raised like any normal girl would be. I think the comparisons to Reimer are an example of the Reddit hivemind desperately seeking comparisons for what they perceive to be medical malpractice.\n\nI'm certainly open to being convinced Reimer's case is relevant, but it's not the important part of my view.\n\nAs stated in the title, I don't see anything wrong with what the doctors in this case did. The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Let's look at some alternative scenarios.\n\nFirst, if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. It's functionally the same as if they had been born that way.\n\nIf the intersex child hadn't received surgery, he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male, female, or whatever, along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened, and it's what I disagree with.\n\nI can only speculate on what that life would be like (so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily) but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough, especially dealing with body and gender issues. I'm not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have been embarrassed about it if I were 12 years old and my genitals didn't look like anyone else's. And much as I think our society's gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened, it doesn't change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.\n\nWorst of all, I can't imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult (as a guy, the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific) or being stuck in a body you don't feel comfortable in.\n\nNote that in the case in question the child doesn't identify as intersex: he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals, he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF, but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth (so he had the option to become female later) rather than leaving him intersex.\n\nTherefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender ~~re~~assignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice, great. If they make the wrong choice, I'm no different from any other trans person.\n\nBy the way, I'm not saying intersex infants should *have* to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex, I guess that's their choice just like they're free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice, and if my parents did that I would be mad at them, but again I'm not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory. I'm just saying it's not inherently wrong to perform the surgery.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

And much as I think our society's gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened, it doesn't change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.\n\nWorst of all, I can't imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult (as a guy, the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific) or being stuck in a body you don't feel comfortable in.\n\nNote that in the case in question the child doesn't identify as intersex: he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals, he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF, but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth (so he had the option to become female later) rather than leaving him intersex.\n\nTherefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender ~~re~~assignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice, great. If they make the wrong choice, I'm no different from any other trans person.\n\nBy the way, I'm not saying intersex infants should *have* to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex, I guess that's their choice just like they're free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice, and if my parents did that I would be mad at them, but again I'm not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory. I'm just saying it's not inherently wrong to perform the surgery.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Try as I might, I just can't see how at least the first part of the statement could be false. I present this in the true spirit of CMV, I feel like I might be missing something.\n\nMy particular view is that in a number of Disney movies, the heroes skins are Caucasian and the villains skins are shades of dark (brown, purple, grey), and that this creates an association between evil and dark skin that children pick up very easily. There are plenty of Disney movies where this is not the case, but there are enough that it is an issue: Aladdin, Lion King, Little Mermaid, Mulan, Hercules (probably more).\n\nBeyond this obvservation, there are a variety of arguments that many Disney movies are racist:\n\n* [An article](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/06/repressed-brits-evil-mexicans-arab-villains-hollywood-animated-movies-stereotypes) from the Guardian detailing the history, mainly from a stereotype + voice actor's race angle.\n\n* [A listicle](http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-racist-moments-disney-movies-cartoons/) with plenty of video links, some back to the 20s &amp; 30s. Is there anyone that will argue that even these are not harmfully racist? And if they are harmfully racist, at which point did the racism disappear or become benign?\n\n* [Diversity in Disney Films](http://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Disney-Films-Ethnicity-Disability/dp/0786446013/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415665430&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=disney+race) - a collection of Essays.\n\n* [Several more books](http://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Disney-Films-Ethnicity-Disability/dp/0786446013/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415665430&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=disney+race) on Amazon.\n\nSo, where are the well reasoned arguments that these depictions are not racist? I think there is some fundamental disagreement between my friend and I on the way meaning is created and, thus, how media works. For her, the \"darkness\" evoking evil stops there, it is only incidental that skin is being used as the pallet. (She goes on to joke about blue people being offended by Genie, etc...) \n\nFurther, she believes that the model is just too simple. That the mechanisms of racism are much more complicated than this belief allows and that it is this kind of thinking that leads to rampant Political Correctness. This is possibly why I am most interested in this argument. I find many arguments that lead to rampant PC to be compelling, but I certainly detest the world in which we are all policing each other for racial, feminist, etc.. correctness.\n\nFor me, it naturally follows that if these characters are teaching negative stereotypes about race, then they are harmful to children as they learn about the world. If you agree that the movies are racist, but that they don't have that big of an impact on children, I'd be interested in those arguments as well.\n\nFinally, I'm much more interested in scholarly or at least well-studied arguments than how you personally \"feel\" about the subject without deep consideration. I will gladly devour any links you have to support your arguments.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

So to cherry pick one or two characters that don't even always show up and then claim this proves the entire series is racist doesn't make sense.

However complex the source material, Disney distills these tales down to their simplest essence in order to engage their target audience, which is children. At the time children are engaging in Disney mania, they are also reading fables, fairy tales, and children's chapter books with similar simplistic features. That's not to say that there aren't deeper or more complex messages to mine from this material--there most certainly are. But we must ask ourselves what is actually penetrating the *child's* mind. It's difficult to answer this question without engaging with actual children. As I ponder it, I think it's almost a chicken and egg question--do children learn stereotypes from Disney that they later re-enact in their real lives, creating a self-reinforcing loop? Or do children enjoy Disney films, blissfully unaware of stereotypes, that they only recognize later as they are exposed to more media, history, literature, etc.?\n\nFor instance, as an adult I was able to easily suss out the races of various voice actors portraying good and evil characters, as well as identify the origin of accents put on by the voice actors to flesh out the characters. But as a child? I don't know if I was sophisticated enough to draw such connections, and I was the kind of kid who was reading Nathaniel Hawthorne in the 5th grade.\n\nI won't argue with you about Disney's racism, stereotypes, or gender role problems, because they are real. I'm just not sure that Disney is actually *teaching* children anything about these roles when so many of the stereotypes they rely on also call for an adult understanding of these stereotypes. For instance, a kid watching TLK knows that the hyenas are the bad guys, but Disney reinforces their badness by using Nazi symbolism. A six year-old doesn't know from Nazi symbolism.

However complex the source material, Disney distills these tales down to their simplest essence in order to engage their target audience, which is children. At the time children are engaging in Disney mania, they are also reading fables, fairy tales, and children's chapter books with similar simplistic features. That's not to say that there aren't deeper or more complex messages to mine from this material--there most certainly are. But we must ask ourselves what is actually penetrating the *child's* mind. It's difficult to answer this question without engaging with actual children. As I ponder it, I think it's almost a chicken and egg question--do children learn stereotypes from Disney that they later re-enact in their real lives, creating a self-reinforcing loop? Or do children enjoy Disney films, blissfully unaware of stereotypes, that they only recognize later as they are exposed to more media, history, literature, etc.?\n\nFor instance, as an adult I was able to easily suss out the races of various voice actors portraying good and evil characters, as well as identify the origin of accents put on by the voice actors to flesh out the characters. But as a child? I don't know if I was sophisticated enough to draw such connections, and I was the kind of kid who was reading Nathaniel Hawthorne in the 5th grade.\n\nI won't argue with you about Disney's racism, stereotypes, or gender role problems, because they are real. I'm just not sure that Disney is actually *teaching* children anything about these roles when so many of the stereotypes they rely on also call for an adult understanding of these stereotypes. For instance, a kid watching TLK knows that the hyenas are the bad guys, but Disney reinforces their badness by using Nazi symbolism. A six year-old doesn't know from Nazi symbolism. The actors portraying the hyenas are all black (but Scar is, of course, a white dude.) Do kids actually know this? Do they draw the conclusion that black people are evil from this?

I, too, have similar memories. When I was a kid my brother and I watched a religious cartoon that came on after Voltron every weekday morning. When the cartoon was over it was the exact time to head out to wait for the school bus. At one point my dad watched it with us for a few minutes and then immediately banned the religious cartoon from our morning repertoire. While not opposed to religion or religious messages in particular (he's a Methodist who believes in God), he was strongly opposed to the tone and tenor of the cartoon in question. At the time it was all very mysterious and he didn't explain his reasons, but when I asked him about it later, as a teenager, he said that the message of the cartoon deeply disturbed him. If I learned any deeply disturbing messages from this cartoon, I certainly can't recall them, nor was I indoctrinated into Christianity as a result of this cartoon because I have been an atheist for as long as I can remember. I think, based on this experience, that kids take in a lot of things, but I don't think these impressions are completely resistant to other contexts (parental teaching, other media, etc.) or necessarily formed for life. I loved Cinderella's gown and handsome prince as much as the next girl, but my parents encouraged my interests in Barbie *and* dinosaurs, space, and computers."}, {"id": "2lwzlt", "body": "This is a well documented viewpoint, but last night I had an argument on this topic with a friend whose intelligence I greatly respect.

In my view a big part of parenting is exposing your children to knowledge and ideas so that they can have their own understanding of how things are. Bad things are a part of life, have a little bit of something bad in a cartoon and now you have a point you can start from to teach a kid some understanding of how things are. Kids are smart so if they see something bad odds are they are going to key in on it and notice something is different about it. A parent can then step in and explain what it is and what it means in a way the kid can understand. It is a good lesson to learn for a kid. It is also a good thing to learn that as time goes on the way things are changes but that don't mean what is good or bad does just the social application of it. How else is a kid going to really learn what is right and wrong or how they should act when in a situation where society or their group of friends are pressuring them to take part in something bad?

Or, if you'd rather, think about it this way. If every time you wanted to hit on a girl, you asked them \"Are you straight?\" or \"Are you single?\", you'd probably get worse results than if you didn't ask those questions. Your intentions are made readily apparent and that causes people to put their guards up and be more suspicious of your advances. You'll get rejected a lot more that way, and that doesn't feel good.\n\nNow think how much harder that is if you're gay. Asking a guy if they're gay is going to make a lot of guys just as mad as hitting on them (and violent reactions to either aren't that uncommon. People still murder others purely for being gay). However, you don't know who is and who isn't. Most people aren't, but some are. Others are violently anti-gay. Still, gay guys need love too, so they have to try. It's hard for them, give 'em a break. You wouldn't want girls getting mad at you and chewing you out because you said they were pretty. \n\nThere's a whole range of reactions to being hit on between fucking the guy in a bathroom stall and yelling at him. Just say thanks, someone thought you looked attractive and that should make you feel nice. \n\n&gt; Oh, well was it my choice for you to be gay?\n\nIt's not theirs either, they're born that way and have to deal with the consequences of their bodies sexual desire. People being mad at them for it only makes it harder on them, and that's something that neither you nor I properly understand, having a sexual orientation that's vilified by a large part of society. \n\n&gt; It would be okay if a female did it.\n&gt;Yes it would actually, I'm attracted to females and I want compliments from them\n\nAre you attracted to [this woman?](http://www.teamjimmyjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Funny-Mug-Shots-ugly-woman.jpg). I think not. Would it make you mad if she hit on you? Also probably not, but that's because society tells us to treat women differently.

You pretty much don't get to have a house in cities as an average working man. \n\nYour work hours are obscenely under exaggerated. You are not supposed to leave before your boss does regardless of your own hours. After work, you are supposed to go drinking with your coworkers late into the night. And after that long night of drinks, rise and shine for another early morning at the job! \n\nFurthermore, there is exceptional discontent when someone goes against the norm, and you are strictly taught against doing so. If a woman decides to give up a child for adoption, the fact that the child was given up will be held against him/her for the rest of his/her life (And I'm talking about the child's life. He/she's ruined because of what his/her parent chose). Anything a family member has done wrong literally reflects extremely poorly upon the rest of the family. This isn't the joke of \"you bring shame on your family\". You seriously do for everyone socially.\n\nAlso, the Japanese are not a highly trusting society. Actually, people are simply polite to such an extreme it appears that way. No one would ever consider being rude because that sort of thing follows you for a long time. You are expected to lie if the truth is impolite, and most people do. \n\nSchooling in Japan is very competitive. Your name is tied directly to your grades. Also, you need to individually test into each specific college. If you don't make it to any, well sucks you're not going to college this year. (Not like how in the USA, you can take SAT/ACT and you're good to go with an application). And, let's say you passed college. Yeah, you're almost certainly not going to go to graduate school. If you dare to get a graduate degree, you're pretty much SOL when it comes to getting a job in Japan. Most businesses prefer only an undergraduate degree.\n\nBasically, pretty much no one is happy. Look up something called Karoshi. That such a thing exists and is so incredibly prevalent in Japan at all should be highly indicative of a poor quality of life. (By the way, you aren't eating meat in Japan. Nope. Meat is very expensive and not often eaten by the average person more than a few times a year). \n\nStatistics don't mean anything in a society like Japan's where social appearance is truly everything (and like I said before, lies are abundant).

"}, {"id": "clzj99a", "body": "&gt;It doesn't matter how much money you have, you are effectively poor as long as you don't spend that money.\n\nNot really. Having money available provides a sense of security and dramatically reduces risk. This is one of the major differences between the middle-class and the poor.\n\nFor instance, I have about $8-10K in the bank plus retirement savings plus thousands in equity in my car. If I lost my job or had unexpected expenses, I could cover that fairly easily - I can pay the rent for the next several months while I job-hunt without major worry, or I could cover up to $5K in unexpected costs out of pocket with no real lifestyle changes. So I don't need to freak out that a fight with my boss is going to leave me homeless in a month or that one mistake will leave me broke. If I was unemployed, I would not just have some peace of mind that I've got time to find a job, I could find the best possible job since I have several months to look instead of needing a new job immediately to pay bills.\n\nWe can see the flipside of this with poor people. If a poorer person gets fired or even winds up working fewer hours than he anticipated, he's going to need to borrow money immediately to survive - feasible if he's got friends/family, but devastating if he's got to take out a payday loan. He's at risk of falling behind on bills and getting his car repossessed. He needs to take the first available job because he can't afford to be unemployed for any amount of time. If an unexpected bill or cost comes his way (car trouble seems to be a common one) then he's in trouble financially even if he is still employed. Plus, knowing all of these things is stressful - he's got to worry that every fight with his boss or every strange noise his car makes could be putting him on the fast track to poverty.

The idea is tax *usage* and *extraction* of land and natural resources rather than ownership, so it would depend what the swamp owner is doing with the land.\n\n&gt; That means the other tax you propose, taxing mining, lumber and whatnot would need to be what, like thousands of times the cost it is now to make up the gap?\n\nIt would not need to be thousands of times.  Even if you *just* tax energy and nothing else, a 5-fold increase in energy prices might be enough to raise the entire tax budget.

I believe it was on of the biggest shocks to my personal views on the world. All my life I suffered from lack of sexual/social success, I wasn't confident, I didn't know how to deal with people around me and I basically reverted to being a nice guy, which is something people &amp; pop-culture advocates through advice, movies, selective presentation by the media and so forth. \n\nWhen I was introduced to the PUA community 2 years ago, and eventually TRP a few months ago, it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in today's society in terms of being social/sexual. Those communities taught me about confidence, staying true to myselfself, embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars, in a way that is actually applicable to the real world, and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement.\n\nI do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women, to a point of de-humanizing them. But on the other hand, there is no other community that gives you genuine advice on how to become that successful person you always wanted to be and reach your goals in life, and I sincerely believe that someone who will ignore the MRA-oriented side of TRP and focus on the advice they give on self-improvement (as proven mostly true by people's 'Field Reports'), will prosper beyond his imagination and there's no competition in that field. The world is a harsh place full of mostly ego-centric people that will not reach out for people with that kind of weaknesses, and one must seek it out in places like TRP to have a chance of actually bettering theirselves.\n\nThe reason I believe that is by looking at facts :\n\nBefore being exposed to the PUA community and TRP : I had no courage to even talk to a girl I had interest in, was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years. This applies to a lot of men my age who you could see for a fact that didn't even know how to deal with those kind of issues and suddenly it's like they swallowed a magic pill.\n\nAfter : Learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction (as directly suggested by those communities), take responsibility for sexual escalation (which doing only half-assed while not being experienced always turned girls off), and finally lost my virginity. Also, I am generally much more confident, got rid of most of my depressive nature and people actually like to be around me way more than before. \n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n"}, {"id": "clzcp56", "body": "The one part of your view that I think can be easily changed is the idea that PUA and TRP are the only game in town for increasing confidence and social ability.\n\n[How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://sameffect.com/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-summary/) was written in 1936, has sold 15 million copies, and spawned all kinds of seminars and other self-help books and communities.

I mean, how did you get exposure to the PUA community?  \n\nLike I said in my very first post, I'm happy for you that you found something that has helped you.  It just seems like your view is based on \"I found this method first, so even though there is a lot of vile nonsense in this community, it is definitely the best\".  I don't think that position is any better than if someone were to say \"Christianity is definitely the best way to get inner peace, and it's *so hard* to find another way to learn to be calm and reflective\".  No, that's just what worked for you, so you stopped looking.  That's fine for you, but it doesn't mean other people aren't making valid points when they criticize your chosen group."}, {"id": "clzhjya", "body": "I guess there's a truth to this, but that's why I want my views to be challenged. Everyone is saying what you essentially said which \"TRP/PUA isn't the best communities because this and that\", yet I didn't get even one example of a community that addresses you personally if you seek help in circumstences that are different from what's presented in its theory, and can give direct feedback to the process you're going through, all the while keep flooding it with new material, based on personal experience and with full analysis.\n\nA book can be great and those communities might be as well, but they are way less approachable as a popular subreddit with 80K members or a group of youtube videos under a certain group with millions of views."}, {"id": "clzhjya", "body": "I guess there's a truth to this, but that's why I want my views to be challenged.

TRP is merely misogyny covered-up by big complex wording.\n\nThere used to be incredibly good site called www.datinggroundwork.com by the guy who runs www.succeedsocially.com which is also a good site. It was on archive.org but it's since removed. I thought site was great as it had actual content regarding sex, relationships. I came from a environment where a lot of my friends or now \"acquaintances\" viewed women, sex rather negatively. I knew it was wrong but didn't know what think instead and for a great deal of my younger years avoided that part of my life until I found content such as his where I developed a view that's positive.\n\nI'd recommend reading through Succeedsocially and even The Game by Neil Strauss. I know it's PUA-Material but it's a great book just please read it in it's entirety. I appreciate and enjoyed his book but I do not agree with any of the PUA experts or content he's endorsed.

I think that when it concerns something morally questionable there are 4 categories. They are as follows\n\n1. Those who won't under any circumstances (very rare in most cases)\n\n2. Those who do it and enjoy it (small percentage)\n\n3. Those who will do it sometimes if they feel they can get away with it\n\n4. Lastly and probably the most common is the type that would only do it under certain rare circumstances.\n\nNow the issue becomes - is subject A a member of group 1 or 4. It is far better to assume that he/she is a 4.

The PUA community when I was into it was really divided. You had scummy people and more natural people, and I mostly prescribed to \"juggler\"'s style of social interaction which was centered around just being able to talk to people and connect with them. A lot of people that go for it(maybe most?) are actually just looking for a steady girlfriend not a bunch of one night stands like people like to think of them as although a prevailing belief is essentially if you can get laid you can get a GF, which is kind of true (maintaining a good relationship is a whole nother beast though).\n\nAlso there is just a huge difference between some general self help stuff like fitness, and something that helps DIRECTLY with social interaction with the end goal finding a romantic partner or partners. Also the men that go to these communities aren't some average guy looking for tips, they are usually people HUGELY behind the dating game with no idea what to do, no confidence, and with a lot of fears about socializing. Having a super obsessed and aggressive community is the difference between a person actually finding the courage within themselves to talk to strangers, and them chickening out. Talking to strangers is extremely terrifying as I'm sure you know and you kind of need the extremes to get yourself to do it regularly especially when you are coming from a place of almost no socializing. \n\nAlso, I don't want this to be offensive but, it is much easier for girls in the dating world than guys usually. Like you said your bf helped you become more confident etc. For guys its the opposite, you can't get a gf unless you are ALREADY great, confident, or have something going for you. Not to mention at least at first guys have to put in a lot more effort at least typically, there are plenty of aggressive girls but typically its the guys that are expected to brave the tundra of starting conversations and escalating. Its harder for us and so it makes sense some guys would need extreme communities to go from social anxiety to constantly meeting strangers and being able to lead conversations.

I would say learning how to connect with women and valuing them even just as friends (..the horror..) would teach you how to have more fulfilling relationships in the long run, and eventually lead to sex anyway because you're getting out there and exposing yourself to new people. "}, {"id": "clzry9w", "body": "You've got some misconceptions about the place, which is understandable given how prolific TRP's reputation has become outside of the sub.  \n\nMost people who come to TRP do so for the same reason as OP.  They aren't looking for women to use and abuse, they want companionship just as you do.  They also want sex, which is something decidedly much harder to obtain as a man than as a woman.  TRP explains in a no-bullshit manner how to achieve those ends.  To frustrated men, it's the panacea they're looking for.  \n\nGood for you for figuring out how to succeed without outsider help, but understand that that's really not possible for all men.

If you take those things out of the picture, all you're left with is a modest assemblage of banal platitudes.\n\nThe fact that it works for you is no evidence that the \"movement\" is a good thing in general.

I believe it was on of the biggest shocks to my personal views on the world. All my life I suffered from lack of sexual/social success, I wasn't confident, I didn't know how to deal with people around me and I basically reverted to being a nice guy, which is something people &amp; pop-culture advocates through advice, movies, selective presentation by the media and so forth. \n\nWhen I was introduced to the PUA community 2 years ago, and eventually TRP a few months ago, it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in today's society in terms of being social/sexual. Those communities taught me about confidence, staying true to myselfself, embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars, in a way that is actually applicable to the real world, and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement.\n\nI do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women, to a point of de-humanizing them. But on the other hand, there is no other community that gives you genuine advice on how to become that successful person you always wanted to be and reach your goals in life, and I sincerely believe that someone who will ignore the MRA-oriented side of TRP and focus on the advice they give on self-improvement (as proven mostly true by people's 'Field Reports'), will prosper beyond his imagination and there's no competition in that field. The world is a harsh place full of mostly ego-centric people that will not reach out for people with that kind of weaknesses, and one must seek it out in places like TRP to have a chance of actually bettering theirselves.\n\nThe reason I believe that is by looking at facts :\n\nBefore being exposed to the PUA community and TRP : I had no courage to even talk to a girl I had interest in, was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years. This applies to a lot of men my age who you could see for a fact that didn't even know how to deal with those kind of issues and suddenly it's like they swallowed a magic pill.\n\nAfter : Learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction (as directly suggested by those communities), take responsibility for sexual escalation (which doing only half-assed while not being experienced always turned girls off), and finally lost my virginity. Also, I am generally much more confident, got rid of most of my depressive nature and people actually like to be around me way more than before. \n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n"}, {"id": "clzd289", "body": "I've also read some PUA stuff and agreed with the basic premise/social strategies you talked about, but the end goals and worldviews for many users are the concern for me.
