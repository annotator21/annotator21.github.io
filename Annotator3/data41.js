People love to talk about the sacredness of the constitution and the founding fathers but what they fail to realize is the American revolution started way before 1776.\n\nNow this is a largely a matter of educated conjecture but I feel the true fathers of the revolution are the multi-racial members of what the aristocracy called the \"many headed hydra,\" a rash of working class riots that went on in the 18th century throughout the western world.  A lot of these men were sailors, which was one of the earliest jobs a free black man could make a decent living (although you still had to work like a dog).  They were rioting against the injustice of wealth distribution, taxes, and forced impressment.  \n\nSo the way I see it, the landholding educated white founding fathers saw an opportunity to free themselves by from the crown and attain liberty and equality *for themselves* by allying with the working class.  When the revolution took hold and the working class were not elevated the same way as the burghesses, unrest almost resumed, which is when the founding fathers held the continental congress and threw out the articles of confederation.  A lot of what makes up the constitution today is based on the federalist papers which were basically about why we need a centralized government in order to control the masses. \n\nWe love the Bill of Rights but it is effectively a sham put in place last minute to appease the populace so they would remain loyal to a new federal congress.  \n\nDemocracy will never exist in a codified form of government because it is not static, it is dynamic and exists in the struggle.  So the only way we can have democracy is to constantly fight for those who are marginalized.  \n\nLiberty is in the civil rights movement not the civil rights act.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMean people suck"}, {"id": "cm4d8tm", "body": "&gt;By rights, by international rights, you belong to the white man of America.

Should we be convincing you to want your \"slave last name\"?\n\nI think it's arguable whether your last name is a slave name, as some other redditors have pointed out. In that vein, perhaps changing it to Freeman in the same way former slaves did would be an option. You could even make it part of a hyphenated last name.\n\nMy thoughts on last names, names in general, are informed by my relationship with my family. I'm much closer to my mother's side of the family but obviously I carry my father's last name. I've always thought it was strange to have this, since I carry both sides as lineage and I'm much closer and more aligned with the sensibilities of my mother's side.\n\nI have a nickname, as some of us do, that's often used more prominently than my actual name. I have nicknames outside of the family too. Pet names even. I've even got a name I made for myself that no one really knows. They describe different facets of me. In picking one for myself, I sort of own a portion of my identity.\n\nA name is pointing to something. Someone. It sounds like you're unhappy with what your \"slave name\", your birth name, is pointing to. Yet, you're also unhappy with the idea of returning to some more ancestral name too, since people will get a kind of social conception of you. It sort of sounds like a kind of crisis of identity.\n\nI guess I'd recommend doing a family history trace to find out how far back you can find that name and see what the actual story is. If you can't confirm it's a \"slave name\" or the manner in which you got it, perhaps the history is irrelevant. You could make up a new last name. You could add it to the one you already have. You could find a new thing to call yourself that is more in line with who you feel you are. Or maybe it's more important to have the name others gave you.\n\nI don't really think it's so much that you want or don't want your \"slave name\" as much as you're looking for a more meaningful name to go by. That's a very personal thing. I'd encourage you to take charge of your own identity by coming up with a name you like.

First it shakes confidence in US debt generally - which means higher interest rates on the short term us debt (of which there is a huge amount) and immediately deeper cuts/taxes.  Second you can't tax your way through this exclusively - there would have to be a corresponding cut in spending (the politics would demand it and frankly it is prudent).  The result of this cut in spending would be a recession.  The result of this tax increase would be a recession.

I completely get that they can be extremely frustrating, the quality can be less than they're worth, and when all is said and done, may not actually save a business as much as they think. However, I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry (a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so there's a lot of data entry) and it got me thinking that there's nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality, but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job. \n\nThe call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced. I don't think there should be a stigma. They provide a service at a lower cost. Why do I deserve a job more than Rahul, Priya, or Mahesh? If a company benefits from it, why not? But is there something I'm not seeing? CMV! I'm totally up for a change let's do it! \n\nEdit: to clarify, I don't mean that I don't find it morally wrong. Morals don't have anything to do with it. I just mean that I don't think that a business owes anything to the country it operates in if that service can be provided elsewhere at a lower cost. \n\nEdit 2: In regards to my original argument that I don't think there should be a stigma my view has changed in the following ways: \n\n1-companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs. \n\n2-conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable. \n\n3-outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door. \n\n4-companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words, they're potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that don't know what they're doing and now they don't work properly. \n\nAgain it's not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. More from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I don't think there should be a stigma. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I completely get that they can be extremely frustrating, the quality can be less than they're worth, and when all is said and done, may not actually save a business as much as they think. However, I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry (a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so there's a lot of data entry) and it got me thinking that there's nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality, but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job. \n\nThe call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced. I don't think there should be a stigma. They provide a service at a lower cost. Why do I deserve a job more than Rahul, Priya, or Mahesh? If a company benefits from it, why not? But is there something I'm not seeing? CMV! I'm totally up for a change let's do it! \n\nEdit: to clarify, I don't mean that I don't find it morally wrong. Morals don't have anything to do with it. I just mean that I don't think that a business owes anything to the country it operates in if that service can be provided elsewhere at a lower cost. \n\nEdit 2: In regards to my original argument that I don't think there should be a stigma my view has changed in the following ways: \n\n1-companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs. \n\n2-conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable. \n\n3-outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door. \n\n4-companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words, they're potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that don't know what they're doing and now they don't work properly. \n\nAgain it's not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. More from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I don't think there should be a stigma. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Everything is better than starving in the streets.

Consider if outsourcing companies paid their workers in foreign countries the domestic minimum wage for the company. Consider if those workers were given benefits and protections similar to what they might have in the US or UK. When you compare these two alternatives, it's obvious why outsourcing is inferior.\n\nThe biggest problem is that companies who outsource have an interest in keeping costs low and worker's protection/benefits minimal.

But then, the US dollar is not nearly as stable as it once was, so fewer and fewer countries are relying on the US dollar to dictate their currency.\n\nAdd in exchange rates, and it's entirely possible that what amounts to a $4/hour wage in the US gives the foreign worker a solidly middle class life, a life which otherwise would be unattainable.\n\nLook at it this way: If I make $50,000/year in a semi-rural area, and that salary affords me my own house, car, and some money for luxuries, it's a fair wage, right? In order to have that same standard of living in say, NYC, or San Francisco, I might have to make $100,000/year or more. \n\nIs the company wrong for placing jobs in lower paying areas? Me making $50,000 a year gives me an equivalent life to someone living in NYC making $100,000/year. \n\n\nSo to apply this logic to outsourcing overseas, if a $12/hour job in the US allows you to have a 1-bedroom apartment, drive a beater car, and eat out once a month, but the same job overseas at $6/hour allows you to have your own house, with more space, land, and similar amenities, and a newer car, whose life will be better?"}, {"id": "cm3v5w3", "body": "What you're not seeing is that outsourcing can take the bottom out of an entire industry.

This problem is caused because by storing large amounts of money, it doesn't circulate.  If it isn't circulating, it can't be used to buy products, pay taxes or wages.  This isn't a problem in the short term, but in the long term it leads to increasing gaps between the rich and poor, and leads to quite a huge amount of problems in society.\n\nOutsourcing is quite similar.  It's taking money out of the local economy, and funneling it overseas.  Once it is overseas, especially in a third world country, it is very likely to ever make its way back to your country.  And once again, in the short term, it's not that big of a deal, and even has its upsides for everyone...  But is seriously detrimental to the local economy in the long run.\n\nShort Term\nPros:  Makes products cheaper leading to more buying power for each dollar, lowers the entry barrier for new businesses, stimulating growth and competition, increases company profits, allowing for increased investing.\nCons: Takes jobs out of the local economy, creating higher unemployment and less money circulating, often lowers the quality of the products or service, opens up a closed economic system.\n\nSo in the short term, it's good for businesses and consumers, bad for employees.  And in all honesty, the employees are a moot point, as they are no longer 'our employees' so who cares?\n\nJust so we have a bit of perspective though, in the US last year, over [2,500,000 jobs were outsourced](http://www.statisticbrain.com/outsourcing-statistics-by-country/).  If we use the [minimum wage of $15,000 a year](http://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-are-annual-earnings-full-time-minimum-wage-worker), that's 37.5 trillion dollars that didn't go into the pockets of working class US citizens, to be spent and recirculated around the economy.  Of course, that figure doesn't account for jobs that wouldn't have existed without outsourcing, but the figure is still quite alarming, wouldn't you say?\n\nThis figure, might in some ways, be slightly offset by the amount of new US jobs created by cheaper labour in some areas.  But not by much.  I'm having a hard time finding an estimated figure of how much US companies actually send overseas each year to pay for these outsourced jobs, but I did manage to find the figure for how much money the US Federal government is sending overseas each year!\n\nLast year, the [government sent $500,000,000](http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/10/news/economy/outsourced-federal-government/) overseas for various contracts.  And, as you can imagine, the government makes up just a small part of the economy!\n\nLet's have a look at raw import export figures though.  Last year, the [US imported over $500,000,000](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/profile/country/usa/) more than it exported.  Even if we pretend that that $500,000,000 is actually the money spent on outsourcing in the entire country, it's still $500,000,000 going out of the economy!\n\nTo put that in perspective, there is only [1.29 trillion dollars of US currency in circulation](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12773.htm). And an estimated almost [13 trillion in the economy total](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/#t1tg1f2).\n\nIf you divide 13,000,000,000 by 500,000,000, you get 26 years before the country has no money left at all.  Of course, it's not that simple, and the US probably won't go bust in the next quarter century from that deficit alone... But I hope this has put the real dangers of outsourcing in perspective for you.\n\n"}, {"id": "2mfr85", "body": "I used to work for an airline and grew to hate travel agencies that outsourced to India (Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, etc) because they were difficult to deal with.

You might outsource support from a company within the same country, sometimes even within the same building. What you're referring to is Offshoring, rather than Outsourcing.

But for products they sell, they should be providing hassle free service.\n\nOne unfortunate hassle, the biggest when dealing with offshored support, is the language barrier, and then the culture barrier.

Hiring a firm to clean your offices instead of hiring a part-time janitor yourself? Outsourcing. Hiring a law firm to handle contract stuff instead of getting a manager to \"just write something\"? Outsourcing. What you are talking about, moving jobs from one nation to another, is a specific subset known as \"Offshoring\" and doesn't always involve firing someone.\n\nThe only companies that add new jobs in new countries when they expand there are service companies. If I make traffic cones why would I put a plant on the Island of Malta if I wanted to sell traffic cones there? People place factories where they are most advantageous. Factories also wear out and periodically need to be renovated or replaced, many of the jobs \"moved\" are simply worn out and too-expensive plants built for a specific set of conditions that no longer exist being closed and new plants being built to make something different. These two things are linked, but it's not necessarily true that if building a factory overseas wasn't an option for whatever reason then the home nation plant would continue operation. In fact, much of the Automobile Production loss that has been hitting Michigan and Ohio so hard has been because those plants couldn't make the new models and labor costs were too high. It's not like they could produce the new stuff in a factory designed for World War II tank production using outdated machinery like that, so there would have to be replacement plants were built somewhere. They decided to build them in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas where you get all the same quality of work as Michigan with lower wages (thanks to lower cost of living and a general mistrust of unions) and a more favorable regulatory environment. The logic was precisely the same for that move as it is for offshoring only it made more sense to keep the factories in the US than move them abroad, do big automakers have an obligation to the City of Detroit to keep production there? I mean, if it's wrong to move things across national borders then it should also be wrong to move things across state lines... unless there is some kind of nuance that I am missing.\n\nThere was a time when it was something of a fad for executives who were being rewarded for meeting certain arbitrary conditions (like lowering labor costs to a target) to close something and ship it overseas for lower labor costs. But that's not exactly popular any more. It turns out that the price of labor in the most popular areas to do this have risen precipitously, people don't stay at jobs like that very long rather they stay long enough to get job training and jump to higher paying ones so work quality is consistently substandard, and there are some pretty serious risks and costs when it comes to dealing with people who are very far away, multiple currencies whose values are always changing relative to one another, and more than one set of government regulations. Many of those same companies are now \"reshoring\" or giving jobs previously farmed out to foreign firms to domestic firms or preforming them in house once again to save money or increase revenue by improving the quality of the process. But really communication and transportation is so cheap that it simply makes sense to have a supply chain that includes companies who have competitive advantages no matter where they happen to be geographically headquartered. For example, there was a news article that made a splash recently because it pointed out that Toyota cars had more American produced parts in them than GM models did."}, {"id": "2mfr85", "body": "I used to work for an airline and grew to hate travel agencies that outsourced to India (Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, etc) because they were difficult to deal with. I completely get that they can be extremely frustrating, the quality can be less than they're worth, and when all is said and done, may not actually save a business as much as they think. However, I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry (a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so there's a lot of data entry) and it got me thinking that there's nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality, but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job. \n\nThe call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced. I don't think there should be a stigma. They provide a service at a lower cost. Why do I deserve a job more than Rahul, Priya, or Mahesh? If a company benefits from it, why not? But is there something I'm not seeing? CMV! I'm totally up for a change let's do it! \n\nEdit: to clarify, I don't mean that I don't find it morally wrong. Morals don't have anything to do with it. I just mean that I don't think that a business owes anything to the country it operates in if that service can be provided elsewhere at a lower cost. \n\nEdit 2: In regards to my original argument that I don't think there should be a stigma my view has changed in the following ways: \n\n1-companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs. \n\n2-conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable. \n\n3-outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door. \n\n4-companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words, they're potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that don't know what they're doing and now they don't work properly. \n\nAgain it's not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. More from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I don't think there should be a stigma. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am saying that the reason most professional athletes are professionals as opposed to amateurs is largely because they were genetically gifted. \n\n\nSecond let me give a narrow definition of professional athlete to avoid the mental gymnastics I see on reddit: An athlete who plays in the generally accepted major league of their respective sport. Because I am American this generally means the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, and by some measures the CFL which may or may not be considered minor league. I don't mind talking about other major leagues, but because I am American I probably will not know them.\n\nFinally, like all generalized statements it can not be said that *all* pros match what I said just that on average *most* do.\n\n\nNow to the argument. I believe the reason most professional athletes are better than collegiate and minor league athletes is because of being genetically better suited to play a specific sport. Take for example that most NBA players are freakishly tall. No matter how dedicated a 5 foot tall man is the chances of him becoming a professional basketball player is next to none. In fact the shortest NBA athlete in history was 5 foot 3 inches so the chance that a 5 foot tall man can become a professional basketball player is statistically 0% if viewed as a percentage of 5 foot tall pros compared to the population. \n\n\nNow look at 7 foot and taller aspiring basketball players, if you are 7 foot tall or taller the chance of becoming a basketball player, if you are American, in the NBA is 17%. 17% of of 7 foot and up people in the USA are basketball players. In my opinion this shows that genetics are what gives most aspiring athletes the needed push from being amateur to professional, the dedication is there but the genetics is what makes them great as opposed to good. This isn't just about how tall you are. It is the difference between a 100 millisecond reaction time opposed to a 90 millisecond reaction time. It is the difference between a 5.0 second 40 yd dash and a 4.7. For one particular skill the increase is minimal to moderate, but better genes help improve multiple skills resulting in a moderate to major difference compared to collegiate and minor league athletes.\n\n\nTL;DR: Because most pro athletes share comparable dedication compared to amateur athletes in minor leagues, the main thing distinguishing the professionals from minor league athletes is better suited genetics."}, {"id": "cm436l7", "body": "I'd like you to consider something that is not related to genetics OR individual motivation: culture.\n\nYou mention NHL.

I am saying that the reason most professional athletes are professionals as opposed to amateurs is largely because they were genetically gifted. \n\n\nSecond let me give a narrow definition of professional athlete to avoid the mental gymnastics I see on reddit: An athlete who plays in the generally accepted major league of their respective sport.

I believe the reason most professional athletes are better than collegiate and minor league athletes is because of being genetically better suited to play a specific sport.

In my opinion this shows that genetics are what gives most aspiring athletes the needed push from being amateur to professional, the dedication is there but the genetics is what makes them great as opposed to good.
