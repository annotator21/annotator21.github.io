Canada has [the lowest business tax rate of any OECD/G7 nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates), so many view it as a good move on the governments part to do so.\n\nI have to strongly disagree with this view for a number of reasons. First, Canada's business tax rate is competitive, especially compared to the US. Total combined Federal and Provincial taxes on businesses are lower overall than just the Federal tax in the US, and this has been beneficial for Canada. For example, the recent Burger King-Tim Hortons merger will have the new entity's headquarters [be based in Canada], where they would pay a lower tax rate overall on their administrative costs.\n\nSecondly, Canadians can afford increases in taxes in other places, combined with social welfare programs to negate the effects on the poor. Citizens of a country seem to be less mobile than businesses, which can more or less gain access to any country so long as they meet that nations requirements, and set up shop there. This being the case, an increase in taxes on wealthier Canadians wouldn't create as high a fleeing effect as it would for business interests. It isn't as easy for citizens with more income to uproot their livelihoods to escape higher taxes, and 'livelihood' isn't a competitive market like most business markets. In addition to increased income taxes, the government could increase the federal sales tax from 5% back up to 7%. [This schedule of Government revenue](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/govt01a-eng.htm) says that sales tax accounted for $67b in revenue for the government in 2009, and an increase of the sales tax by 40% would mean an increase in 20-30% or slightly less in revenue. If these new revenue streams are put towards social programs to reduce poverty (in part to negate the negative effects of increased taxations), we would see an overall rise in wealth and purchasing power parity, which would overall have a positive effect on the economy, *without eliminating the competitive advantage of Canada*.\n\n**TL;DR:** Redistribution of wealth through income and consumption taxes would achieve higher government revenue without threatening Canada's competitive advantage in business tax rates, and would overall represent a Pareto improvement in Canada (ie, those who are made worse off by the taxation can be remunerated by the benefits).\n\nI'm interested to hear opinions on this.

Even with a \"meh\" economy, Canada has a totally fine budget situation.  There's no need to cut the budget or raise taxes.  Canada is actually doing totally fine budget wise.  If the economy starts booming more, there will probably be big surpluses.  If it tanks again, there will be deficits, but cyclical deficits aren't really a problem if they get fixed when the economy recovers (as Canada's have).\n\n&gt;But I'm not convinced that federal cuts to the budget would be wise, either.

That being said, you are kidding yourself if you think anyone can do it.  \n\nYou used green day as an example (unwisely) so I'll challenge you to listen to covers of green day on YouTube.  And don't just search by what is already popular, I mean search from new.  Ok, maybe you've found someone legitimately talented after about 15-30 videos.  Do they also write songs?  Are those songs anywhere close to as memorable as good riddance or American idiot?  If so, congrats, you found one of the 1% of people who are as good as greenday.  \n\nIts true that anyone can play greenday songs.  I learned good riddance after playing guitar for about a month.  In fact, I can learn the majority of popular songs ever written in under an hour.  But that doesn't mean I can write songs as good or play them as well as the musicians who wrote them.  Capturing emotion and a feeling takes a lot of work, and in some cases, creative genius.  \n\nAnd as for actors.  I recommend you attend a group acting class, or watch past reality shows like if I can dream or the starlet.  Both shows contain actors and actresses trying to make it, but perhaps more importantly, they contain actors and actresses who are cringeworthy.  I mean absolutely terrible.  \n\nYou can't point to a few musicians who were successful and claim that is proof that anyone can do it either.  Musicians who become popular often do so because they are already charismatic, and used to effectively expressing emotion to a large group of people.  They have also probably had to sell themselves to more than a few record execs.  And if they are terrible actors, their reps will probably let them know and save them from embarrassment.  \n\nA better way to judge these things are to watch athletes in commercials.  I'm not talking about peyton manning or Lebron james, I'm talking about some Ray rice car biz commercials or really anything Russell Wilson has done.

Especially in a singer's case, if they're a mainstream star, or really anyone who's made a music video, that's at least *some* acting experience.\n\nSecondly, speaking as an admittedly amateur performer: you can tell the difference between the pros and the amateurs based on the roles they play.

I could scribble a series of lines and call it modern art, but what does it mean? There wouldn't be any expression and that would show through. \n\nArt is a form of expression and creativity, and modern artists are excellent at one they do. Most people could not come up with the concepts they do and still execute them in a way that has an impact on the viewers in the same way that most people couldn't have the athletic skill that the athletes you mentioned have. \n\nYou could argue that if you trained hard enough and for enough time you could push yourself to a skill level similar to these athletes, but creating an idea from nothing is something that can't really be taught. That could make artists even more valuable... But, anyway, that isn't the point I'm trying to make. I just wanted to point out how unique and difficult these skill sets actually are.

Any schmuck can learn to play a song they heard on the radio but very few people can actually write a good song themselves.  I think it's offensive when they call American Idol contestants \"artists\" on the show when most of them merely have a talent.  I think you're right to criticize singers like that if you're comparing them to artists, but they're not artists.  They're merely entertainers.  It's sad that we like to pretend that they're something more than that but we still pay them to be entertainers.  It's not their job to produce quality art.  It's their job to give us a distraction from our stressful lives and hoover up as much of our money as possible.

Most working actors (usually those who managed to stick it out for more than 10 years) who support themselves make a comfortable living, but are not pulling six figures or more per year.  \n\nAlso, as for the zillion takes, those are often due to things that you wouldn't notice in-frame--things like lights being too hot on the cast, cameras having focus pulled improperly, etc.  Ultimately, the number of takes is the director's call, not the actors'.  Some directors will give their actors one take.  Others like to do thirty or forty per setup.

Movies aren't run by actors, nor are most albums by the musicians. They're mostly run by the people above those artists: the producers, the directors, etc. Look at an average film, for example, and see how much stuff went into it independent of the starring actor, that are making money: a good script, special effects in some films, a powerful soundtrack, etc. Movies these days are more about the director; he's the one who put all of those elements together in a way that matches the concept that he has in his head. The director is the artist on exhibition in the film most times.\n\nSame with music. At least, for pop music, where thing like autotune and lip-syncing are used. Because, again, the artist isn't the star. In some cases, they're literally just a pretty face to dress up and put with a song. Someone else wrote the music, someone promoted the shows, dressed the artist up, set the stage to match an emotional content that fits with the song (sometimes with effects, or dancers, etc.)\n\nIf you want a better example of an artist performing largely on their own skill, look at stage actors, broadway, chicago. While there are still directors and other technical aspects, they tend to be in greater balance with each other, because the smaller space of the theater and the presence of a live audience make it harder to marginalize the work of the actors over the other aspects. On stage, an actor's performance can make or break the show, because the audience can see them closely and scrutinize how it impacts the show as a whole.\n\nNow look back at professional athletes. True, they make a living on skill, but it's also a performance. A different kind of performance, mind you, but a performance nonetheless, showing a dramatic conflict between the two teams, who are both showing off their athletes like the old carnival shows with a strong man. In those games, there are managers watching overhead, manipulating the course of the game, swapping players on and off field, to put on a better performance (to win the game, but that's a natural extension of putting on the best performance). There are elements added to make the show more interesting (halftime shows, cheerleaders, mascots, those little kiss-cam things on the jumbo-tron). \n\nIf anything, athletes put the same kind of work into their games as stage actors put into their shows: they contribute physical skill and technical prowess for people above them to use as elements to put on a larger show for an audience. Therefore, the two deserve at least a similar rate of pay for both careers, as opposed to a dramatic difference between the two.

Because they are skilled at playing a game, their salaries are more important than the hundreds of hungry we could feed, or the tens of ailments we could cure, or the infrastructure we could un-crumble.\n\nYou want to change the face of sports forever? Player salary caps. Remove the ability for the team to be attractive to a player just by the number of 0's.

Can you have 'meaning' without agents to comprehend or interpret it? What would it mean to say that you have 'meaning' in a universe with no consciousness? Something can only 'mean' something *to* someone. It doesn't exist in and of itself.\n\nSo while life may not be meaningless *now*, I think he's coming to the conclusion that, after the entire human drama has unfolded and we've all died off - which we will - all of the meaning we created will go into nothingness with us. So any meaning to our lives is just as fleeting as the lives themselves. And after you, personally, die, your sensory experience is terminated and thus the entire thing might as well be over, as far as you're concerned. So any meaning you may have gleaned from your life - any of *your meaning* - will die long before everything else does. \n\nNow as for the argument that many bring up, that one's focus then should be on the 'here and now' - that's all well and good and I think it's a fine life philosophy. But it doesn't negate the premise, per se. There may still be good reasons to live, but one might think about adjusting how they view things. Accomplishing things during your life, for example - can anything really be 'accomplished' if it will eventually be undone? Most people do things with the thought of the future close to them - this is the essence of all progress, or goals. This is also where most people derive meaning from their lives.

Many other actions exist that are WAY more self-reinforcing than reproduction! Like smelling!\n\n&gt;But smelling does not in and of itself make more smelling.\n\nOf course it does!

The first national Thanksgiving was proclaimed by the Continental Congress for December 18, 1777 as a day of giving thanks and praise to God for watching over America during the tough times of the Revolution. George Washington later proclaimed a national day of Thanksgiving in 1789, again as a day for Americans to thank God for their blessings. The official Thanksgiving holiday that we celebrate today was first proclaimed by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, to be celebrated on the final Thursday of November every year (later moved to the 4th Thursday of November in 1939). Once again, it was set aside as a day of thanks and praise to God for the blessings He had bestowed upon the American people.\n\nToday Thanksgiving continues to be a day of giving thanks. It's a more secular holiday now, one that doesn't necessarily involve praising God or some other higher power. Rather it's a day of being thankful for what you have in your life. Family, friends, liberty, security, a home, a job, comfort, et cetera.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that Thanksgiving is not intrinsically tied to European-Native American relations or the Pilgrims' feast at Plymouth.

The first national Thanksgiving was proclaimed by the Continental Congress for December 18, 1777 as a day of giving thanks and praise to God for watching over America during the tough times of the Revolution. George Washington later proclaimed a national day of Thanksgiving in 1789, again as a day for Americans to thank God for their blessings. The official Thanksgiving holiday that we celebrate today was first proclaimed by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, to be celebrated on the final Thursday of November every year (later moved to the 4th Thursday of November in 1939). Once again, it was set aside as a day of thanks and praise to God for the blessings He had bestowed upon the American people.\n\nToday Thanksgiving continues to be a day of giving thanks. It's a more secular holiday now, one that doesn't necessarily involve praising God or some other higher power. Rather it's a day of being thankful for what you have in your life. Family, friends, liberty, security, a home, a job, comfort, et cetera.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that Thanksgiving is not intrinsically tied to European-Native American relations or the Pilgrims' feast at Plymouth. It's a holiday for being thankful for the good things in your life. The current incarnation of the holiday may be partially inspired by the \"First Thanksgiving\" at Plymouth, but the tradition itself is much older. Besides, many cultures throughout the world have their own celebrations of giving thanks for receiving blessings."}, {"id": "cmcg0x6", "body": "\"the story if thanksgiving\" is heavily insulting to the Native Americans."}, {"id": "cmcg0x6", "body": "\"the story if thanksgiving\" is heavily insulting to the Native Americans."}, {"id": "cmd3w18", "body": "Plenty of people celebrate Thanksgiving without celebrating the \"story of Thanksgiving.\""}, {"id": "2nbc4l", "body": "Columbus Day and Thanksgiving essentially descend from the same historic chain of events; the eventual successful colonization of the Americas by Europeans.

More positive meanings than the pilgrim story would be thankfulness and family.  Many holidays have transformed in this manner to accommodate diversity and changing times.

I've worked for lawyers who charged $150 an hour, and ones who charged $750 an hour, and in no way was the higher priced one better. From my experience, the ones who charged $150 an hour were actually more successful, even when they went against attorneys charging much more. \n\nAttorneys charge based on a variety of factors: how much they think they can get paid, their experience, their expertise in particular areas (including if they are specialized), how big their staff is, overhead, how much other attorneys in their area are charging, etc.  \n\nMany of the attorneys who charge less do it because they're either solo practitioners or in a smaller law firm (and thus it's their way to compete against the larger or more well known firms) and/or because their type of specialization has clients who don't have as much money. For instance, if you primarily do employment law or civil rights, you'll usually be dealing with clients who don't have that much money.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is"}, {"id": "2namx3", "body": "It seems to me that our legal system is built on a capitalistic model.

Say someone is being sued by someone else who has a lot of money and they hire a lawyer who has won 95% of his cases and with the first person who can't afford such a high caliber lawyer, wouldn't the odds be slightly in favor of the more seasoned lawyer with a proven track record?\n\nI would like to not believe this, so please help me change my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Perhaps an accident.\n\n&gt; jast\n\nBased on how 'a' was pronounced in previous words and the generally intention of simplifying the language, it seems like the pronuncation of this word changed to have a certain 'ah' sound that isn't common in English (I at least can't think of a word that contains it, at least not in American English, though it's probably common in British English).\n\n&gt; ould\n\nI'm not sure this is a pronunciation change, but I don't understand why the 'u' was thrown in, except for the sake of making everything look weird. It doesn't seem to serve a purpose and goes against the entire intention (being redundant/unnecessary).\n\n&gt; aafte\n\nThis should be exactly the same as it's always been: after. The extra 'a' makes no sense, and where did the 'r' go?\n\n&gt; 20 iers\n\nAlso makes no sense. I had an issue with \"iears\" before, but this is worse. If anything, in this new spelling format, it should be \"iirs\".
