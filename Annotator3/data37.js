Women orgasm from stimulation of their clitoris. This pleasure will be called **orgasmic pleasure.**\n\nMen and women feel pleasure from other touching as well, like massages, kissing, oral sex, and anal sex (as a receiver), and this pleasure will be called **non-orgasmic pleasure** because it does not directly result in orgasm. \n\nThe typical idea of anal sex for a heterosexual couple is that the man penetrates the woman's anus with his penis. This gives the man orgasmic pleasure and *hopefully* gives the woman non-orgasmic pleasure.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMy CMV is that is a man desires to penetrate his partner anally, knowing that she will not find orgasmic pleasure in it, he should be willing to be penetrated anally himself, also not finding orgasmic pleasure in it. Men's and women's anuses are not different; women are no more inherently prone to enjoy receiving anal sex than men are. \n\nNow, typically we do things that don't please us but that do please our partners because typically people take pleasure in pleasing their partners, so even if something doesn't initially please you, knowing that it pleases your partner causes you to take pleasure in it. For this reason, a woman may be more inclined to find being anally penetrated pleasurable (non-orgasmic) as she knows it will stimulate her male partner's penis for his orgasmic pleasure. If the roles were reversed within that same couple, and she was penetrating him anally, she'd have to be using a dildo, which does not give her orgasmic pleasure. For this reason, it is perfectly okay for a straight couple to only want to perform anal sex one way: the male penetrates the female. However, my CMV is only that the penetrating partner should be *willing* to be penetrated his/herself. If within his/her couple unit they two decide they don't want to do anal that way, then that's fine. But if he is going to ask to give it then he should be willing to receive it *if* that would bring his partner pleasure like it brings him.\n\nIf you want to penetrate your partner's anus you should be willing to have your anus penetrated too. If that never happens and your partner doesn't want to penetrate you, fine, but you should at least be willing and open to the idea if you want to do it to somebody else. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Different people look for different things in sex.  You're view on anal is only applicable if everyone feels the same about it.  Some people like giving, some like getting, some like both, some like well you get the point.  Or at least I hope you do.  \n\nIn another comment you say that if a man desires to receive oral sex he should be willing to perform oral sex on his partner.  But the problem is that it's not the exact same for both parties.  If we apply your logic about anal to oral, then the man who wants to receive oral does not need to be willing to perform oral on his female partner, but instead he must be willing to suck a dick.  \n\nComfort zones, willingness to experiment, and what an individual we finds pleasurable varies wildly from person to person.  You cannot expect all actions to be equal to everyone, and you cannot approach sex with a bartering mentality.  Instead of anal-for-anal, a healthier approach would be something-pleasurable-for-something-pleasurable, or better yet just an overall willingness to please your partner and enjoy yourself."}, {"id": "cm5gryn", "body": "&gt; and no pleasure for the female.\n\nWell she may find pleasure in it.

Most people don't care when Chanukah is, when Diwali is, or any other holidays.  If you say Merry Christmas, fine.  I know it's Christmas and I would like to be merry.  But if you say Happy Holidays thoughtlessly, what I hear is \"I don't care when your holiday is supposed to be, celebrate it now\".\n\nIf you have some specific holidays in mind, feel free to wish Happy Holidays.  But if you are just trying to be \"inclusive\", it feels an awful lot like that brilliant South Park line: \"Christmas is a time for people of all religions to come together and worship Jesus Christ\".

Yes, it is undeniably rooted in Christianity. But I want to make it clear that believing in Jesus is not a prerequisite for taking part in these festivities. I want you to enjoy the non-religious aspects to this season because I think they're fun, and don't want you to feel weird or left out if you aren't a Christian. Everybody is welcome\"\n\nOur history as a country is undeniably Christian. We have always been a Christian country and it's ingrained in a lot of our cultural pillars. Like the fact that our post office was closed or alcohol wasn't sold on Sunday, aka the (christian) Lord's day. We are now making an effort to realize that we should not be a Christian nation anymore. We should be an inclusive nation that accepts all religions or lack thereof. But we also can't deny that the fondation of a lot of things we do is based on Christianity, because that's just what our history is.\n\nSo, we removed Jesus from Christmas. The mascot stopped being a manger and started being a fat dude in a flying sleigh throwing ridiculous amounts of presents at children while eating cookies. So I agree, it's definitely people saying merry Christmas without wanting to say merry christmas. \n\nBut it's people making a point to say \"Merry completely secular Christmas.\". People who view Christmas as being on par with the 4th of July or Thanksgiving. It doesn't matter where you came from, what religion you are, or anything. All that matters is your living in America and this is just something we do as an excuse to not go to work, get together with people, get super drunk, eat tons of food, and just being our usual obnoxious materialistic selves. \n\nThat's why many reacted with \"the war on Christmas\". They saw a sacred holiday being co-opted by a bunch of non-religious people to mean something totally different than what it's intended purpose was. And they're not wrong. We DID take the Christ out of Christmas. The argument is simply that they can still have Jesus as part of their Christmas if they want, but let's make sure people who DON'T want the religious aspect to the season feel just as comfortable and welcome.\n\nBecause Christmas is pretty awesome. There's tons of TV shows about it, you see tons of ads for shit you suddenly absolutely need, the grocery store goes under a complete revamp. And that's not going to change.

We also learned about Hanukkah. Again, a very secular view maintained. God was never mentioned. We learned about the menorah, but weren't really clear on why. And we mainly focused on homemade latkes and dreidels and candy coins.  \n\nWhy? Because that's what \"Happy Holidays\" really means. It isn't referring to ANY actual Holiday anymore. We don't give a shit about Jesus anymore. We also don't give a shit when Hanukkah ACTUALLY is. Cause it's not about either of those. It's just referring to this period of time in which we seem to have fucking perfected cultural appropriation to create this weird fucked up little \"season\" that doesn't MEAN anything, but we love to death. \n\nHappy Holidays isn't about coming together and worshiping Jesus. It's about coming together and celebrating this weird fucked up Frankenstein tradition that we've created over the years. Most of Christmas has nothing to do with religion anymore. But if you still think Santa and the tree and all that is still too tied with Christianity...yeah, they get how you would feel that way. Christ is kinda in the name afterall.\n\n....But they still want you to take part in the other shit. The awkward work parties, the dumbass sweaters, the sudden fixation with peppermint that exists during literally no other time of the year...that shit is the shit people are trying to say \"come on! Enjoy this! It doesn't MEAN anything. It's got nothing to do with Jesus! It's just super fun!\"\n\nWhen I hear \"Happy Holidays\" I try not to think of it as referring to any singular holiday. I try to think of it like \"seasons greetings\". It's not really celebrating any partciular day so much as it's celebrating that weird little bubble of festiveness and happy that we enter into a few weeks every year. \"The holidays\" last from the Monday after Thanksgiving until December 25. Then we just start obsessing about New Years and how many times were' TOTALLY going to the gym.\nIt's not about religion anymore. We just like to keep traditions and want everyone to join in and add their own twist to it, so that it stays alive. Nobody actually gives a shit that our calendar year starts over January 1st. We just like that we have a day where everyone has decided to make a bunch of goals and party and get super drunk.

In virtually all cases, Christians have taken offense to a government or commercial entity that has tried to become more inclusive or neutral regarding winter holidays. The real goal of the \"War on Christmas\" is to claim ownership of the end of the year, and pressure others to only acknowledge the Christian holiday and exclude all others.\n\nThis greeting of \"Happy Holidays\" is an attempt to be inclusive and unassuming as to the private practices of others. Instead of being \"politically correct\", this greeting is an attempt to be *actually correct*. There are many winter holidays that can be either secular or religious. Unless you know about the private life of the greeting recipient, \"happy holidays\" is the most accurate greeting. Many holiday store sales will span multiple holidays and sell items to celebrate multiple holidays; enforcing the branding of a single holiday is inaccurate to say the least.\n\nThe world is full of diverse beliefs, and a certain group of individuals is taking offense when those beliefs are acknowledged. Stores should be free to cater to *all* customers, and not just those with a majority religion. There is nothing wrong or spineless about being inclusive. The most offensive part of the \"War on Christmas\" is one group trying to exclude all others.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Media plasters their ad space with celebratory greetings of those holidays, and politicians will scramble to be first in line in the parade ( when one is held).\n\nNow, I am not begrudging any of this.
