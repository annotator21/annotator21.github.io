There is this concept called a voting bloc from game theory that basically governs party politics. In the most rigid implementation within a pure democracy, voting blocs are a contract to hold a prior vote on an issue and have everyone in the bloc vote the same way.\n\nEven if the bloc in question does not comprise the majority of voters, it has a high chance of being the deciding vote. When you do the math and divide by the number of members in the bloc, it turns out that their votes actually count for more than the votes of independents in determining the outcome. If a bloc does contain the majority of voters, then no one outside the bloc has any impact at all.\n\nBut a voting bloc represents a large portion of the community and they likely more or less agree on most things or they wouldn't be in the bloc to begin with. So what's the harm? The problem is that the vote within the bloc is also subject to the same mechanism.\n\nIf we assume a world where membership in a bloc is absolute and cannot be changed once adopted, then there is the potential for three members to control every decision, so long as all decisions are binary. All it takes is a series of majority blocs. Eventually the majority is 3/5 or 3/4.\n\nObviously our world is quite a bit different. People move between voting blocs all the time, sometimes even changing blocs on any given issue. However, in the US it takes about 20% of the population to have a controlling bloc within a given political party. That means those 20% can dictate policy on a given set of issues if that party controls the Senate, House and Presidency, or if that party has a super-majority in Congress.\n\nIf 60% oppose them but do not realize that such opposition is widespread, nothing will be done to combat such moves.

Sometimes life without parole is the only option.  \n\n- They could be an addict, and which even in voluntary programs it's like a [revolving door]( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/health/23reha.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) with many visits.  Some addicts never beat their addiction.  \n\n- 40 percent of [seriously mentally ill]( http://m.healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/04/01/mental-illness-in-americas-jails-and-prisons-toward-a-public-safetypublic-health-model/) have ended up in the corrections system at some point.   But we can't cure mental illness. The best we can do is control it through medication and therapy, but we cannot normally compel people to take their medications.  And there is so little mental health support for the public especially without health insurance.   You could release the ill convinct in a stable state but he'll be right back as soon as meds run out or he feels he doesn't need them any more. \n\n- those with a compulsion to sexually assault children can't be \"cured\". How do you change what a person is attracted to?\n\n- Gang members enter their gangs for life,  and gangs are responsible for [48% of violent crimes]( http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment#disablemobile) in their districts.  These inmates may be killed if they try to leave their gang upon release. \n\n- those who simply prefer living outside the law. Perhaps they were brought up that way.  Perhaps they had a rough childhood and the world taught them it to survive.  You cannot make a person change their values and beliefs.    For example it's really hard to convince a drug dealer to stop dealing if he was making a $5,000 a week tax free.  When he's released (as as felon) most employers won't hire him.   If he could get McDonald's to hire him, how long will he be happy making minimum wage and not being able to afford rent?    You would need to change the economics of legal jobs.  You'd have to make it worth these people's time to give up their illegal activities.   How can you when unemployment is still high and so many jobs don't pay a living wage? \n\n\nHow do you rehabilitate people who many not want it? Who can't make a living wage doing honest work? Or who face death if they try to leave their gang?    If we can't cure addiction or mental illness in those on the outside who try it voluntarily,  how can we cure inmates who may not want to be cured?\n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2nck53", "body": "The title says most of what I want to say, but to elaborate a bit, there seems to be a lot of outrage over the fact that Darren Wilson was not indicted, not just among members of the community but abroad, and I'm not quite sure where it's coming from.

Now that he's so strongly associated with that problem, it seems like people don't want to admit that perhaps Brown did at least reasonably seem to pose a threat because it would feel like they're betraying a cause they care a lot about, even if to admit that would be the more reasonable position to take.\n\nChange my view."}, {"id": "cmcetow", "body": "It's entirely possible that Wilson believe himself to be in danger.

Now that he's so strongly associated with that problem, it seems like people don't want to admit that perhaps Brown did at least reasonably seem to pose a threat because it would feel like they're betraying a cause they care a lot about, even if to admit that would be the more reasonable position to take.\n\nChange my view."}, {"id": "cmcen1x", "body": "Please explain what danger Darren Wilson was in from a person who was more than 100 feet away from him and running in the opposite direction."}, {"id": "cmcen1x", "body": "Please explain what danger Darren Wilson was in from a person who was more than 100 feet away from him and running in the opposite direction."}, {"id": "cmcfx2p", "body": "The physical evidence shows that he was not turned around and that he was moving toward the police officer. \n\nYou can't argue with physical evidence.

To me, the phrase simply means that one of your friends is closer to you, and understands you better, and you just flat out get along with them better than anyone else. Due to this, they are your favorite, or best, friend. \n\nIf you look at best friends like this, anyone can be a best friend. If I only have one friend, they are my best friend. If I'm male and my friend is female, that doesn't change. \n\nGender is a very arbitrary and fickle thing. When people say things like, \"boys will be boys\" or \"girls have to play with dolls\" or whatever, they are making this image into which they cast everyone the meet, arbitrarily. What if you're a bit that plays with dolls, or a girl who wants to play \"boy\" sports?\n\nThe issue comes because everyone is completely unique. No matter how close you are to someone, there are parts of you that are different. Similarly, no matter how different you may be to someone, you share something common. Friendships can blossom in any number of ways, and restricting by gender or age or race or anything at all is limiting the scope of life's experience."}, {"id": "2nccrb", "body": "Alright firstly girls and guys can be friends sure.

I'm biromantic, though, first crush was a girl who sat next to me in school. By OP's reasoning I'm not sure whether this means I can be best friends with everyone (because I'm not interested in sex with anyone) or if it means I can't be best friends with anyone at all because I could potentially want to have a romance with them.\n\nThe point is OP's reasoning is pretty dumb. It's perfectly possible to like people a ton and to always have their back but to recognize that you both would be incompatible in a long term relationship or as lovers. You can value the shit out of someone's presence in life as a friend while recognizing that they want different things out of life compared to you. \n\nOne of my best friends basically falls into this category. He's personally conservative, pretty old school, somewhat religious, wants a family, completely straight, would like kids someday... yeah, I trust he has my back and if he ever needs me I have his, but I absolutely wouldn't want a relationship with him. He's still a pretty great guy, all told. And that doesn't mean I wouldn't want a relationship with guys at all - I *am* in a relationship with another guy right now, actually - but in the case of this one friend, I'm reasonably confident in saying love will never happen on either of our sides.\n\nAnyway, the point would be about roles. The role of a friend in your life is very different from the role of a lover or a life partner. Someone could check all the boxes in the friend category, but lack that added compatibility that you'd want if you were looking to live with them or be emotionally and/or physically intimate with them.

But then, we know there are pet owners who didn't think that through, who just adopted a pet with no clear thought of how to care for it.\n\nI'd like to say that anybody old enough to be responsible for an animal (children aren't really caring for a pet, their parents are and they share some of the responsibility) would be mature enough to not be swayed by a children's animated short film. Of course, there will always be a few exceptions, who are immature enough to imitate what they saw in the film without questioning whether it made sense in real life.\n\nHowever, I will point out that most pet owners who watch this will already own their pet before seeing it. They'll already have learned how to care for their animals, and are unlikely to change that just because they saw someone do it differently in a film. Or else, they'll already have proven themselves an irresponsible pet owner before the film could have had any chance to manipulate their behavior. The movie will not affect the outcome in either case. The practical risk is that someone sees the film, somehow accepts the behavior in the film as appropriate pet care, *never sees another example of pet care that might contradict it, or which might have equal or greater value by virtue of not being an animated film*, and then decide to adopt a pet *without ever looking further into the practice of caring for an animal, looking into things like pet food, pet supplies (litter for cats, for instance), etc.*, and never speaking with another person about their pet care practices or comparing with another pet owner. While this is possible, it seems pointless to get worked up about the ridiculously small number of dumbasses who fit into this category, or let it affect something like our choice of movie to watch on a Friday night because of the pre-show short film.\n\nOr, you know, you can watch the film and accept it as a metaphor for a man slowly improving himself for a woman he loves, instead of a literal influence on someone's pet ownership. *Just a thought*"}, {"id": "2nc8qe", "body": "I'm referring to this one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_%282014_film%29\n\nWhat would happen if you tried that in real life: the dog would get a bunch of severe health problems, become obese, and soon die.

Maybe I don't need more than three types of shoes and someoene else at least 5? Same with food, I already addressed that. For me perhaps a smaller food budget is perfectly satisfactory whereas someone else will see few \"fancier\" food items as very important (special brand of olive oil, organic something...) Therefore, my need to include alcohol can be perfectly covered by my smaller basic survival needs, and you can still judge me over someone whose all expenses come from the needs you listed, but they see bigger expenses on it as necessary. \n\n\n&gt;Also a fair point. However, these are all certain types of food. Maybe some of it is more expensive, but it still contributes to your continuing homeostasis. The things I describe do not. Financially struggling people should probably not be buying certain types of food either, depending on the situation, but I see that as less irresponsible than buying these pure luxury items.\n\nI disagree, so a juice that isn't necessary is ok because it is still food, but my beer (that might cost the same, and essentially be no less nutritious than some store brand juice, plus the comfort/entertainment) is a waste? Ice cream is food so its fine although neither necessary nor healthy but not beer? Oreo's? High quality olive oil  and organic, because you care about good nutrition? Food or not, none of these are necessary and we are talking about simple priorities and ways you treat yourself. I treat myself with beer, someone else has a sweet tooth, and another is very concerned with getting the right brands based on quality. Only thing that makes mine wrong to you is that alcohol also gets you drunk - but that is your prejudice. \n\nIt comes from the idea that if you aren't making tons of money you don't deserve to enjoy yourself. Fuck that. \n\n&gt;I used the above examples because it is what i see people buying on regular intervals. Normally you do not see financially unstable people always going to movies or concerts on a regular basis (like I said, doing this every once and a while is fine). It is arguably more rare, but I would still label it as irresponsible. It is just that alcohol, tobacco, and drugs are more of a consistent money hole.\n\nIn the examples I listed I am talking about regular basis. Regular basis of what one sees as necessary groceries. Regular basis of how much electricity you waste. A smoker can be very careful in every other way. ALl these items are consistent money holes, it is just up to a person to choose which one does the most for them.\n\n&gt;That is true. I never said I made that call from people at the grocery store or something. These are people I know of personally or semi personally that make these decisions, who I know are in the situation I describe.\n\nOk but the thesis is just that you are irresponsible if you spend money on the three things you listed. My point is that you don't have to be. Like I said, if there is some hypothetical list of 100 things you are wasting money on (anything not absolutely necessary), absolutely everyone will have some points checked since we aren't robots and prioritize based on what gives us satisfaction. These are just three possible things on list of many. Being irresponsible would mean checking on more points than a certain percentage. A person who spends money on alcohol can be perfectly responsible if they budget elsewhere. Same with drugs and same with cigarettes. A person not spending money on any of these things can still waste money in tons of other ways therefore being irresponsible. \n\nIt is possible that you know people who are both irresponsible and spend money on these things, but that alone isn't what makes them irresponsible.

Being poor isn't just about having less money to work with in budgeting. Being poor has a deep effect on the psychological context in which a person is operating. So, you simply can't say that poor people are irresponsible because they aren't able to do some of the things (resisting temptations, budgeting properly) that people are able to do while not poor.\n\nAccording to some researchers, scarcity overburdens the brain, depressing basic cognitive skills:\n\nhttp://thepsychreport.com/research-application/featured-research/the-cognitive-burden-of-poverty/\n\nPoverty also creates a huge amount of stress, and alcohol and cigarettes are ways people self-medicate for stress. Facing the constant stress of being poor is different from someone who is not poor just wanting to occasionally chill out or have fun by having some drinks. Quitting an addiction, on the other hand, is highly stressful. It requires significant emotional and social resources, which poor people often just don't have.\n\nYou say that people who spend money on cigarettes and alcohol when they're financially struggling are \"irresponsible people,\" as if this is a character trait, not a consequence of circumstance.

A drink at the bar every once and a while or a joint to take the edge off is great; we all have to let loose every once and a while (arguably even more so with poor people, because their lives are by and large very difficult).  \n\nMy issue is that I see many people who struggle to pay the rent, pay for food, and other basic needs (some of whom have kids, which makes it much worse) who set aside money for outrageously priced pack of cigarettes each week. \n\nIn essence, my problem lies with the people who view these *luxuries* as just as important as bills, rent, and food. \n\nCMV\n\n**Edit** [u/huadpe](http://www.reddit.com/user/huadpe) brought up some good points that I should add on. \n\nI did not properly address addiction. I realize these habits can be hard to kick and I do not expect someone to go cold turkey and stop overnight. However, I think these people should be *actively trying* to kick these addictions if it is eating into their primary survival expenditures. \n\nIf anything of what i described is used to not fall into a worse addiction, such as smoking cigarettes to avoid heroin, I see that as a necessity, and a definite exception to what I am talking about. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So five years ago I was drinking and driving and I ran into a parked car. the police that arrived to document the accident realized I had been drinking and took me to jail. I agreed to take the breathalyzer test, and 6 months later it was used against me as evidence to convict me of a dui my punishment was minor, but I was given the impression by my lawyer that I would have had a better chance of avoiding a conviction if the court did not have proof of my blood alcohol content at the time.\n\nSo I was guilty, and I did what I thought was the honest thing, and it was used against me. I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was a little more naive then. So I can't understand how anyone could benefit from consenting to taking the test.
