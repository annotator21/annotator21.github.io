Reasons include:\n\nBureaucracy\n-----------\n\n* GPs (family doctors) typically only see patients during office hours. \n* Hospitals often have very narrow windows for surgery, e.g. early morning one day per fortnight, which require the patient to be available at a very specific time\n* Even for minor surgery a patient can expect to need many appointments, from GP, to initial assessment in hospital, to pathology, to pre-admission, to surgery, meaning many days of work would have to be missed to treat a single condition.\n\nBecause of these bureaucratic issues, It is very difficult for people who work in the private sector and who cannot easily get time off work to access the healthcare system, unless it's so serious that they are admitted in an ambulance.\n\n\nReluctance to diagnose\n----------------------\n\nIt has been said by cynics that \u201cThe purpose of a GP is to stand between a patient and treatment\u201d. For whatever reason, GPs are very reluctant to refer people for tests for any condition that is not obviously life-threatening. Examples of \u201ctolerable\u201d conditions include herniated discs, recurring tonsillitis, tendonitis, ADHD, but also includes symptoms which might be deadly but which probably aren't (e.g. bleeding from the rectum).\n\nI mention these specific conditions because I have either had or witnessed people in my own life with such conditions be denied diagnosis and treatment. I would accept that the NHS is simply under-funded, and cannot afford to pursue such minor complaints; however, I\u2019ve known an equal number of people with the same conditions and of similar severity who *have* been able to access treatment on the NHS for these non life-threatening, but life-affecting conditions. It seems to always be the same people who either get access to treatment or denied treatment, affected by two main variables:\n\n* Affluence. I briefly lived in a very wealthy part of the country, and the NHS care and commitment from GPs was impeccable. Even for minor conditions they did everything they could to diagnose and treat me. I\u2019ve also lived in some of the poorest parts of big cities, and the care has been consistently abysmal. Wealthy people are can also pay for tests privately, e.g. for an MRI scan which reveals a herniated disc, which could then be used to force the GP\u2019s hand to refer them for NHS treatment. Poor people are simply sent away with no tests and thus no diagnosis in the hope that the condition will fix itself. \n* Patient persistence. Even within those poor regions, very insistent, pushy people who possess both the gall and the time to pester their GP, ask to see different doctors, or visit hospitals directly to seek treatment are more likely to get access. People who take their GP\u2019s first rejection as the final answer and who do not return until their condition has drastically deteriorated, are effectively shut out of the healthcare system. Such people will typically suffer for years or for the rest of their lives, resigned to the fact that the NHS is unwilling to help. The current system requires patients to \"game\" their doctors to access diagnosis and treatment.\n\n_____\n\nNo healthcare system will ever be accessible by 100% of the population; people with crippling social anxiety, strange religious practices, the homeless, and other marginalised groups will always be difficult to reach. But due to the sheer number of \"normal\" people who cannot access NHS care in the UK, the NHS should not be described as a \u201cuniversal\u201d healthcare system. Even the privatised healthcare systems of France and Australia are more \"universal\" than the British NHS.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n_____\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Nice job, NHS, only took a year and a lot of disobedience and not-taking-no-for-an-answer on my part to even get sent for a **test**, never mind treatment. As it progressed so far, once I'm healed up I might be anally incontinent. Yay. I feel sorry for the men who are too embarrassed to even see a doctor about a condition like this in the first place, never mind having to go back again and again to get it sorted. People who are taught \"no means no\" are getting screwed in the current system.\n\nI expected at least a little bit of debate and persuasion in this thread. Some statistics showing that my experience is an anomaly might have done it. Or showing that, say, some combination of factors, such as being a scruffy, strong and healthy-looking, shy, working-class male, might be what's working against me, and that this specific rare combination of traits is the only demographic to have these kind of experiences. That might have garnered a delta. But apparently CMV would rather just bury a thread than actually try to change someone's view about as sacred a cow as the NHS. Poor show, CMV.\n\nNo delta for you.

Foam protects the beer from oxidization, and slows down the process of getting stale.\n\n4. My biggest personal frustration with drinking from bottles, is that every time you take a sip from the bottle, you move/angle/shake the beer and that accelerates the process of getting stale. You probably do it 20-40 times while drinking from the bottle. You would do less in the glass, plus the beer would get less stress in the properly shaped beer glass. There is also foam which protects the beer.\n\n5. Yeast: from of the beers, it is customary to pour out 90% of the bottle into the glass, and the remaining 10% are swirled in the bottle to shake up the settled yeast, and then it is poured on top of the glass to increase the taste profile. You cant do that nor with can nor with the bottle, unless you shake the whole container, but them you ruin the rest of the bear.\n\n6. Flavour: points 2-5 add up to an inferior flavour. You can't smell the beer (Smelling improves your taste experience). Moving it around back and forth in the bottle while sipping it makes it stake and there is no foam to protect it. No yeast. Drinking from the can some could even argue that it adds metallic taste to it. \n\nPersonal anecdote: I didn't enjoy drinking beer as much, because it didn't taste as good, and it was just something I was doing because my friends did. Constant sipping from the bottle, it would take me 20 minutes to finish a bottle. After seeing one of the Stella Artois commercials about how their beer should be consumed, I decided to try it at home. Well, the process is interesting in itself, but I was delighted by the improvements in taste. I would drink half of the beer within a first hearty sip, and drink the rest within 5-10 minutes. Flavour was so much better. I thought it was just me and did the same test with my friends, and they all agreed with me. Just the same way as a glencairn glass enhances your whisky experience, same way a proper beer glass enhances the beer flavour. Do a test at home. Try it with your wine glass. This might not work with bud light, but I'm sure you will notice a difference even with mid-level commercial beers (Stella, Heineken, Corona, etc) and a must with craft beer ."}, {"id": "cmfxepf", "body": "I like your take on it."}, {"id": "2np8vd", "body": "I have multiple reasons.\n\n* You can see if there is beer in the bottle at a glance\n* They do not warm up as fast from holding it as in a can.\n* Cleanup is way better, the bottles will almost self-organize in the box\n* The box that bottles come in open from the top\n* The box that cans come in open in the center and you are reaching inside for cans and it is a pain in the ass to fill it back up with cans.

You play on a smooth flat table or counter top. You need 2 shot glasses, a quarter, and a bunch of beer cans. Essentially one player spins the quarter on the table. While the quarter is spinning, the player must then take both shots of beer with the same hand they spun the quarter and then pick up the quarter before it stops spinning also with the original hand. If done correctly, the quarter and glasses are passed to the right, if not, the player repeats until they get it right. Now where the game gets really interesting is when the land mines come into play. Basically any beer that has been finished by a player at the table becomes their own land mine. By using these land mines, you can smash a person's quarter mid spin causing them to have to down their remaining shot(s) and restart their turn; not to mention that once that land mine is used that beer remains in the spot it was used for the remainder of the game. So now it becomes a constant obstacle that a spinner must try and avoid. You play until the table is so filled with beer cans that nobody can safely spin. You can try to play with bottles but spinning quarters are hard to trap with bottles because of how flat they are, plus slamming a bottle on a table sometimes results in broken glass."}, {"id": "2np8vd", "body": "I have multiple reasons.\n\n* You can see if there is beer in the bottle at a glance\n* They do not warm up as fast from holding it as in a can.\n* Cleanup is way better, the bottles will almost self-organize in the box\n* The box that bottles come in open from the top\n* The box that cans come in open in the center and you are reaching inside for cans and it is a pain in the ass to fill it back up with cans.

My sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing, and I casually mentioned how I don't believe I'd leave any. This was met with much more vitriol from both my mom and sister than I expected. Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes (she just kept saying \"you take care of your own\" over and over) and my mother just kept telling me \"that is wrong\" without explaining why, I'd like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. Consider the following scenario:\n\nI have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about 80. I had my kids in my 30s, and so they are now in their 40s. My assumption would be that during the first 20 or so years, I have taken care of their educational costs, provided for their basic needs, and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their 20s, when they have begun providing for themselves, I will be there as a back-up should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen, but they would be largely left to their own devices. After 20 or so years of that, when I die, I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I don't even think I'd leave anything for the grandkids' education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan.\n\nThe reasoning:\n\nStatistics: 60% of the second-generation blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to 90% when you move into the third-generation. To me, this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending (I'm not saying this happens in all cases, as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs, but I'm saying it is the most common reason).\n\nEthics: I don't believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldn't be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned, these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood; why should they be guaranteed these \"lottery winnings\" well into adult life, when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? Moreover, leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives, as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition. Nearly every tycoon, from Carnegie to Buffett to Gates has noted that leaving anything more than a small sum of money to their children would be terrible for their ambition and their motivation to make something of their lives.\n\nSome final comments: I understand that this is putting the cart WAY before the horse. I don't have considerable wealth. I don't even have kids. This is just how I believe I'd behave in this scenario given my current mindset. Furthermore, I really don't want to come off as miserly, but if I do, please tell me. Anyway, beyond that, please try and change my view!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It would be ridiculous to expect 40 yr-old children to expect their parents to keep supporting them. The situation is completely different for a 20 yr-old, for example. Having grandchildren also complicate the situation. Nevertheless, after a certain point, your success and your failures *should* be your responsibility, and it's not like parents who are rich enough to leave a significant inheritance would neglect their children growing up."}, {"id": "2np4sw", "body": "I realized this was a controversial view yesterday while driving with my family to Thanksgiving dinner. My sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing, and I casually mentioned how I don't believe I'd leave any. This was met with much more vitriol from both my mom and sister than I expected. Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes (she just kept saying \"you take care of your own\" over and over) and my mother just kept telling me \"that is wrong\" without explaining why, I'd like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. Consider the following scenario:\n\nI have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about 80. I had my kids in my 30s, and so they are now in their 40s. My assumption would be that during the first 20 or so years, I have taken care of their educational costs, provided for their basic needs, and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their 20s, when they have begun providing for themselves, I will be there as a back-up should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen, but they would be largely left to their own devices. After 20 or so years of that, when I die, I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I don't even think I'd leave anything for the grandkids' education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan.\n\nThe reasoning:\n\nStatistics: 60% of the second-generation blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to 90% when you move into the third-generation. To me, this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending (I'm not saying this happens in all cases, as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs, but I'm saying it is the most common reason).\n\nEthics: I don't believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldn't be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned, these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood; why should they be guaranteed these \"lottery winnings\" well into adult life, when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? Moreover, leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives, as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition. Nearly every tycoon, from Carnegie to Buffett to Gates has noted that leaving anything more than a small sum of money to their children would be terrible for their ambition and their motivation to make something of their lives.\n\nSome final comments: I understand that this is putting the cart WAY before the horse. I don't have considerable wealth. I don't even have kids. This is just how I believe I'd behave in this scenario given my current mindset. Furthermore, I really don't want to come off as miserly, but if I do, please tell me. Anyway, beyond that, please try and change my view!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Likewise, it's ridiculous to simply leave a substantial amount of money to a child without first teaching them how to manage it. There is a huge difference between teaching your kids \"the value of a dollar\", and teaching them how to manage and grow wealth. It's the same as teaching a kid how to run a lemonade stand, and then expecting them to run a Fortune 500 company, it simply doesn't work. \n\nThe parent needs to take the time to ensure that the child knows how to manage the money before making those arrangements, otherwise they're asking for trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Moreover, leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives, as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition.

Each of them made their comments at a stage of their life where their children were adults. I'd like to assume that they tried to instill these qualities of wealth management in their children... And yet they still make these comments. Doesn't this say something to the effectiveness of a parent if even some of the most effective and prodigal managers of money may not have been able to instill the same qualities in their children? (Massive assumptions here, I know. There could be any other reason for them deciding to not give their wealth to their children).\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is this: Parents can try to teach something to their kids, but I believe kids, most often, learn from experience.

And I generally agree with the \"no free lunch\" approach to inheritance, but I think that merit based rewards are something I'm totally down with.  \n\nAlso, being an avid gamer, some kind of tiered reward structure seems pretty neat.  Like, if you get a 3.0 gpa or better in high school, congrats, you get a free ride in college.  If you graduate from college with a bachelors degree, congrats, you earned $10k (bronze reward), but get a 3.0 and you get $15k (silver), 3.5 $20k (gold), and if you have a 4.0 $50k (platinum).  When you work at at a job for at least three years, or, your total salary for the last three years is, say, $100k, you unlock the house buying starter fund ($100k).  At some point, maybe when they're about 40, if they've reached all milestones with at least a bronze rating or better, they unlock the big retirement fund starter of maybe a couple million dollars.  I think by that point, someone who's worked hard enough to hit all the milestones along the way *most likely* would be able to appreciate and not squander that kind of money."}, {"id": "cmfnwu9", "body": "Definitely a fair point. I think my view has changed in the sense that I now realize I would at least leave something like a scholarship with stipulations or compensation for the work of executing my final endeavors."}, {"id": "cmg97rv", "body": "It seems most of your argument against this is giving them a wad of cash and how that can be a bad idea. \n\nMy family isn't exactly rich but when my parents bought a house they ended up essentially borrowing a lot of that money from my grandmother and they split the difference between what she would get as a typical investment and they would have paid for a loan. Doing something like this is a great idea as both parties get a benefit and it keeps the money in the family without it being any sort of handout. I believe when my grandmother died the inheritance went to paying off some of these debts they had to her. \n\nIn the same token a lot of my schooling was paid through government baby bonuses they put in an education fund from the time I was born, it was never a massive amount of money but it helped pay for most of my university, the rest was borrowed from my parents as is essentially a student loan without interest. My parents put 4 kids through university this way (although some of my siblings have student loans as well) \n\nI'm not going to try an argue this is all better or worse than charity since that's another argument all together but if you want to enrich your family doing it in ways where people traditionally have to borrow money is a good way so that both parties benefit and there is still accoutability for everyone as well"}, {"id": "2np4sw", "body": "I realized this was a controversial view yesterday while driving with my family to Thanksgiving dinner. My sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing, and I casually mentioned how I don't believe I'd leave any. This was met with much more vitriol from both my mom and sister than I expected. Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes (she just kept saying \"you take care of your own\" over and over) and my mother just kept telling me \"that is wrong\" without explaining why, I'd like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. Consider the following scenario:\n\nI have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about 80. I had my kids in my 30s, and so they are now in their 40s. My assumption would be that during the first 20 or so years, I have taken care of their educational costs, provided for their basic needs, and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their 20s, when they have begun providing for themselves, I will be there as a back-up should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen, but they would be largely left to their own devices. After 20 or so years of that, when I die, I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I don't even think I'd leave anything for the grandkids' education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan.\n\nThe reasoning:\n\nStatistics: 60% of the second-generation blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to 90% when you move into the third-generation. To me, this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending (I'm not saying this happens in all cases, as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs, but I'm saying it is the most common reason).\n\nEthics: I don't believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldn't be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned, these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood; why should they be guaranteed these \"lottery winnings\" well into adult life, when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? Moreover, leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives, as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition. Nearly every tycoon, from Carnegie to Buffett to Gates has noted that leaving anything more than a small sum of money to their children would be terrible for their ambition and their motivation to make something of their lives.\n\nSome final comments: I understand that this is putting the cart WAY before the horse. I don't have considerable wealth. I don't even have kids. This is just how I believe I'd behave in this scenario given my current mindset. Furthermore, I really don't want to come off as miserly, but if I do, please tell me. Anyway, beyond that, please try and change my view!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We like that. The thing here is that the dices forming 1 2 3 4 5 6 is not more special than if it formed the sequence 6 6 1 3 4 1, for example. To nature, it is not more special than any other outcome. It is just about probability.\n\nNow the controversial part. Many religious people claim that order can't come from disorder. There must be some entity that created us. Well, in my opinion, we are not organized beings in the universe's point of view. we are that very low probability that happened. It is just like that same example in the last paragraph. Except that our hands throwing the dice is the big bang and the dice are octillions of atoms.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
