Now, the state gives incentives to those married, but the point is to recognize what is basically supposed to be an organic social formation.\n\nHomosexual marriage does not have that inherent ordering in itself to produce children and the bond to raise them. So the argument is that the *only* thing making homosexual unions a \"marriage\" is the declaration of the state.\n\nThis is often the point where people say we should just have \"unions\" for homosexual couples and just not call it marriage. But to have the same treatment legally and a different name is to miss the point of why the state grants the treatment it does to heterosexual married couples. And it's also very true that equality in all but name is still imperfect equality; that's why many homosexual couples are not satisfied to have a \"civil union\".\n\nThe primary concern in this line of thinking is that if all marriages become treated the same by the state, they are not being treated, really, as \"marriages\", but as \"unions\", regardless of the name used, because now it is not the act or social unit which is being given the name appropriate to it, but it is something that has its existence, in the cultural mind, thanks to the state's declaring it to be. Marriage becomes like money or state borders in this way; it's an artificial construction governed by the state.\n\nThis certainly isn't an apocalyptic scenario, but it causes some people to fear it is a step toward Plato's Republic, in which the family as an organic unit is completely destroyed, and there are a host of problems to be concerned about if that were to take place."}, {"id": "2nnulr", "body": "At the root of it, everyone who opposes gay marriage uses the Bible, Jewish religion, the Quran, or whatever other religious documents to counterargue gay marriage and continue it's prohibition.

Once again, I don't think it should be banned, and prosecuted. Everyone can do whatever he wishes to as long as it is mutually agreed and does not hurt. I only oppose its full exposure to the public, claims that it is absolutely normal and must be broadly accepted and discussed everywhere. First of all I think it is awkward to talk about someone's sexuality in public, because there are certain things everyone has to keep private. I don't really bother talking about the color of my poop in public, because I know it sounds disgusting to some people, although I do believe there are certain group of people who would like to discuss about it with me. But nonetheless I feel it is private to me. We die for privacy when Snowden and others reveal that all our communication being tapped, but we openly expose our genitals and fight for the right of bringing to everyone's attention for what sort of activities we use them. Isn't it ridiculuous? Why someone has to be proud to be gay? Is it an achievement? What is the reason behind dressing up like a woman with masculine beard, and claim top Eurovision award? This is insanity and cannot be explained through secular reason. It seems there is a conspiracy behind this shit. Because, it is obviously destructive phenomena in long run. But I don't think it will last long, it is just yet another sexual revolution, similar to what happened with hippie culture. Yes it gave many freedoms, but people went back to family values again. I think all the hype around being gay will soon subside, and the nature will prevail, people turn to their family values.

I'm not gay myself, but the idea of oppressing the happiness of an entire class of people offends me to my core and as such I'm very much in favor of gay marriage even though I have no personal dog in the fight. I'm also atheist so I have no religious basis of my thinking. \n\nHowever, I believe I have a legitimate reason it shouldn't be allowed that isn't based on theology. \n\nEvery time a man and a woman conceive a child, that child is a unique generic product of those two parents. Since we're all genetically unique, there is no other combination that can produce that child. This also includes any mutations that might occur in that child, a mutation that may never happen in any other combination. \n\nThat mutation could be to make that child immune to some disease. It could be a disease that will eventually destroy the human race. But, that child could be the key: the child may reproduce, passing the mutation down through its progeny, and breeding offspring that are immune. \n\nIn a very real sense, that child could wind up being the thing that saves humanity. \n\nNow, let's back up a step: what happens if the male parent turns out to be gay? What if he never mates with the woman to produce that child? Remember that genetically, no other pairing could produce that child with that mutation. \n\nIn a sense, isn't the fact that the male was gay a death sentence for the human race? Given that, should we disallow gay marriage to ensure that survival of the human race? Some might say yes. \n\nObviously, (one of) the flaws in that argument is that simply disallowing gay marriage doesn't ensure that male will breed with a female, let alone the right female. But couldn't you argue that the male is willingly taking that possibility away if he's allowed to? Isn't the continued survival of the human race worth a reduction in freedom? \n\nNow, my feeling is that if we're not going to allow people to be happy in whatever way makes them happy, then what's the point of the human race surviving anyway? No, in my opinion, even if I believed it was dooming us I wouldn't want to not allow people to be happy. That's defeating the reason for us being here (one of the reasons anyway). \n\nSo, just to TL;DR this thing: by allowing gay marriage we may, because of genetics, be dooming the human race. That's a completely non-secular reason against gay marriage (a reason I personally reject, but you didn't say it had to be an argument we ourselves agree with, right?

I'm not gay myself, but the idea of oppressing the happiness of an entire class of people offends me to my core and as such I'm very much in favor of gay marriage even though I have no personal dog in the fight. I'm also atheist so I have no religious basis of my thinking. \n\nHowever, I believe I have a legitimate reason it shouldn't be allowed that isn't based on theology. \n\nEvery time a man and a woman conceive a child, that child is a unique generic product of those two parents. Since we're all genetically unique, there is no other combination that can produce that child. This also includes any mutations that might occur in that child, a mutation that may never happen in any other combination. \n\nThat mutation could be to make that child immune to some disease. It could be a disease that will eventually destroy the human race. But, that child could be the key: the child may reproduce, passing the mutation down through its progeny, and breeding offspring that are immune. \n\nIn a very real sense, that child could wind up being the thing that saves humanity. \n\nNow, let's back up a step: what happens if the male parent turns out to be gay? What if he never mates with the woman to produce that child? Remember that genetically, no other pairing could produce that child with that mutation. \n\nIn a sense, isn't the fact that the male was gay a death sentence for the human race? Given that, should we disallow gay marriage to ensure that survival of the human race? Some might say yes. \n\nObviously, (one of) the flaws in that argument is that simply disallowing gay marriage doesn't ensure that male will breed with a female, let alone the right female. But couldn't you argue that the male is willingly taking that possibility away if he's allowed to? Isn't the continued survival of the human race worth a reduction in freedom? \n\nNow, my feeling is that if we're not going to allow people to be happy in whatever way makes them happy, then what's the point of the human race surviving anyway? No, in my opinion, even if I believed it was dooming us I wouldn't want to not allow people to be happy. That's defeating the reason for us being here (one of the reasons anyway). \n\nSo, just to TL;DR this thing: by allowing gay marriage we may, because of genetics, be dooming the human race. That's a completely non-secular reason against gay marriage (a reason I personally reject, but you didn't say it had to be an argument we ourselves agree with, right?

A lawyer could probably give you a better answer, but in most cases (AFAIK) the prosecutor, usually a county DA, would bring charges themselves.  Grand juries are used commonly for federal crimes, and to varying degrees in the states.\n\nMost countries have abolished grand juries altogether.  The intent was for a jury of people to be a check on prosecutors - to prevent a prosecutor from prosecuting ridiculous cases, and to compel a prosecutor to prosecute certain cases.  Whether it really does that is another question. Prosecutors, in practice, almost always get indictments.  \n\nThis is where it gets a little weird, though.  Prosecutors get indictments in literally [99% of grand jury cases](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/)... *except* in cases involving police shootings.  In those cases, it's incredibly rare for a grand jury to indict.\n\nIn this case, the prosecutor has been accused of bias, and of not wanting to prosecute.  He gave the jury access to a ton of information, a highly unusual process (normally they just get the selective evidence the prosecutor wants to show).  It's entirely possible the grand jury *thought* their job was to judge Wilson's innocence, when that would be the job of an actual jury.\n\n(I know this comment is getting long).  Doing a de facto trial by grand jury means that Wilson was never cross-examined, and the grand jury didn't hear experts cross examined.  It provided a biased view of the facts (like a pathologist report stating that Michael Brown was high, which wasn't necessarily backed up by the data).  That's what infuriates me about this scenario - we have less information than we would have had, and we don't get to see a trial.

[It's between \"reasonable suspicion\" and \"preponderance of the evidence\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof#Probable_cause_for_arrest). Notice that it's *lower than* preponderance of the evidence; in other words, even if the balance of the evidence is against the prosecution they can still have probable cause to indict.\n\nYou have probable cause for a search if there is \"a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found\". Generalizing this to an indictment, you only need to believe that there is a fair probability that the accused committed the crime. Conflicting evidence is therefore easily enough to constitute probable cause: if half the witnesses say he did it and the other half say he didn't, you've got about a 50% chance. A single witness is also generally enough; they'd have to be both unreliable AND heavily outweighed by other evidence for their testimony not to constitute probable cause.\n\nOn that note, there are currently [16 different witnesses](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/newly-released-witness-testimony-tell-us-michael-brown-shooting/) who said Michael Brown had his hands up when Wilson fired at him. Again, any one of those is generally enough for probable cause. "}, {"id": "cmf29qs", "body": "First, need to clarify a few facts.\n\nThe Ferguson jury didn't find Wilson not guilty.  There would have needed to be criminal charges for them to find him not guilty.  They decided that there wasn't probable cause that a crime had been committed, so no criminal charges were filed.\n\nWilson's collarbone was never broken.  Not sure where you've heard that.  [Here](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/photos-of-darren-wilson-s-injuries-released/article_f57bce0e-c214-5aa7-9b1f-4b5aeced6a42.html) are some pictures of Wilson after the encounter.\n\nFurther, it doesn't really matter if he did break Wilson's collarbone -  breaking a police officer's collarbone is a crime, and a very serious one, but the penalty isn't death, and it certainly doesn't warrant getting gunned down on the street.  The relevant question is if Brown posed a threat to Wilson *at the time he was killed*, which took place 150 feet away from the car where the alleged assault took place.\n\nAs far as whether or not Brown posed a threat, it depends on who you believe.  Wilson said that Brown looked \"like a demon\" and charged at him, and Wilson fired in self-defense - this would clearly be a justified shooting.  Brown's friend Dorian Johnson said that Brown was trying to surrender - this would clearly be unjustified.  Clearly, one (or both) of those accounts isn't accurate.  Which is it?\n\nAnd this is where we come back to the Ferguson jury... it's very likely that the Ferguson jury thought, as you did, that their job was to determine Wilson's guilt.  *But it wasn't*.  Their job was only to determine *if this case would go to trial or not*.  They decided it wouldn't - which means that Wilson was never cross-examined on his testimony, and neither was Johnson.\n\nA lot of details about Wilson's testimony [don't really make sense](http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7281165/darren-wilsons-story-side), and the same is true [of Johnson](http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7287443/dorian-johnson-story).

So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them.

It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you\u2019re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don\u2019t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let\u2019s pretend, ok?) , they\u2019d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \n\n**Thanks**\n\nHelp me out, guys.

I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you\u2019re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don\u2019t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let\u2019s pretend, ok?) , they\u2019d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \n\n**Thanks**\n\nHelp me out, guys. I\u2019m stuck on this one. Thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Someone will stop if you shoot them once and their initial attack is deterred by the pain.   However,  some people are going to try and fight you to the death.   If someone is raging on adrenaline and determined,  they won't stop just because you have inflicted a serious wound on them.   There are also many factors that will drastically reduce a persons experienced pain.   Being on drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine,  pcp, bath salts, etc can allow you to take an eventually mortal wound and keep going.   Persons in a manic or psychotic state feel limited or no pain.   An ED I was rotating through once saw a psychotic young man who was delusional and cut off his penis, used a turkey carver to go in and excise the abductor muscles in his groin, and had been pan searing it for twenty minutes before his family came home and discovered the horror.  His face was calm as can be as he rated his pain as a 0 out of 10.   The notion that everyone who could present an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm will be deterred by pain is naive. As such,  I choose to defend my family with a platform that is going to reliably stop any attacker(s) while still limiting the amount of overpenetration to limit the risk of harming my neighbors in the process.   55gr soft point ammo works great for minimizing overpenetration while still having reliable stopping power.

To me, this just leaves a lot less leeway for understanding and compromise, and would increase paranoia and the tendency to shoot first out of the fear that YOU might about to be shot. I have a strong suspicion that that sort of mindset is a large contributor to the dramatic increase in instances of police officers shooting civilians.

I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you\u2019re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don\u2019t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let\u2019s pretend, ok?) , they\u2019d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \n\n**Thanks**\n\nHelp me out, guys.

"}, {"id": "2nn1t8", "body": "I'm quite pro gun and argue about guns regularly on reddit. I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you\u2019re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don\u2019t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let\u2019s pretend, ok?) , they\u2019d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \n\n**Thanks**\n\nHelp me out, guys. I\u2019m stuck on this one. Thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

As a defensive weapon, it's accurate, reliable, and easy to shoot. \n\nWhen NRA supporters say that the bells and whistles that they stick on their \"big black gun\" are cosmetics, I disagree. Some things are cosmetic. But most things, foregrips, magpuls, optics, ect are features that help your tool to what it does better. So, in this, I agree with you somewhat. \n\nIn addition to accessories that may or may not make the firearm \"better\" the AR15 platform is extremely modular. The ability to change from a .223/5.56 to .300 blackout to .50 Beowulf to [cailbers I've never heard of](http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/showthread.php?t=337969) to meet the exact needs of anyone who needs a rifle makes this one platform good for anyone from farmers to competitive shooters to hardline survivalists. \n\n\nI agree that intermediate rifle calibers will not be the end all of armed revolution or repelling an invasion. The supposed \"enemy\" will have so much more hardware and firepower than any group of AR toting militiamen. However, they would be the backbone of any urban assault/defense, supporting those who are waging the war of attrition with ambushes and \"sneaky underhanded tactics\". \n\nI really think that the AR15 is a good rifle that meets the needs and wants of a large number of people. I believe that it is the everyman's firearm and helps lessen the number of physical firearms that someone would need just by being modular. \n\nI think I skimmed the surface on why the AR15 has a purpose for a commoner. The topic of discussion shouldn't be this firearm. What people are afraid of is what this and any other intermediate rifle caliber, rifle caliber, and pistol caliber firearm can do to human life in a short time span in the wrong hands.

I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you\u2019re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don\u2019t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let\u2019s pretend, ok?) , they\u2019d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \n\n**Thanks**\n\nHelp me out, guys.

"}, {"id": "cmfbr76", "body": "I notice that when you reference home defense you only talk about inside the home. If there is a riot where crowds of violent criminals are throwing molotov cocktails and firing indiscriminately into homes you would want something similar to an AR-15 to protect your family. I'm comfortable with my M1 Garand for handling such a situation but an AR-15 is a damn good weapon/deterrent for such a situation. You would be able to accurately fire from much further than a pistol, be able to take care of anyone throwing molotov cocktails, and target acquisition is much easier than with a 12 gauge or 30-06."}, {"id": "2nn1t8", "body": "I'm quite pro gun and argue about guns regularly on reddit. I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you\u2019re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from?

You get far more rounds, standard mags have 30, and an 18 in shotgun will have what, 7 or 8 max? An AR is much easier to reload than a shotgun, especially under stress.
