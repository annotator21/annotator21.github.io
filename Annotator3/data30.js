Recently my sister kept bringing it up, and the more she talked with me about it, the more I kept thinking: why doesn't this bother me? Is there something wrong with me? Maybe I need to go and see a psychologist, and see a psychologist I did. They told me that I had adequate coping skills and said I was fine. My sister made a big deal out of this and it made me doubt myself. If someone could make me falter in the belief that I have, just think about what the media can do to people.\n\nI realized that there was nothing that I could do, that the situation was out of my control. It wasn't my fault. It happened. Dwelling on horrible experiences only makes the pain worse. I just try not to think about it, and when my thoughts go to that, I can just let it go, and move on.\n\nEDIT: last paragraph."}, {"id": "cm8spqw", "body": "I'm glad you could cope with it well, and I wish the best for your sister man\n\n&gt;Dwelling on the horrible experiences only makes the pain worse\n\nThis was my reasoning too\n"}, {"id": "2mv3n4", "body": "This is something I noticed after seeing the huge amount of discussion about rape on reddit. Now note specifically I am talking about the non-violent kind of rape where neither member is injured physically, but express verbal consent still wasn't given or statutory rape where one member is too young to give consent.\n\nIt seems to me that in today's society, men are expected to want sex all the time. It's most obvious in cases where female teachers have sex with younger boys and peoples reaction to it (mostly) is 'NOICCE' or 'I wish this happened to me, my teacher was hot'. Then when it happens with the sexes reversed the reaction is mostly, 'That disgusting pedo deserves to get anally raped in jail' and 'Oh that poor girl, a terrible thing has been done to her'.\n\nAs a result of this, you come across a lot of men who have been technically raped but who simply get over it extremely quickly despite feeling dirty, violated etc as other guys around them just say stuff like 'You got laid dude quit complaining'. Essentially, society acts to minimise those bad feelings, allowing the man to move on quickly.\n\nHowever, when a woman gets raped, society's reaction amplifies these bad feelings to make the woman feel even worse. Society makes women feel they are now damaged, and a mark has been burned on them forever. This kind of thing is obvious in cases where a woman who initially thought a sexual encounter was just uncomfortable is now told she was raped. Society's general reaction to rape would only make the woman feel even worse about it, and not let her move on for a much longer time than for a man.\n\nI am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong, but it seems to be that way. So CMV, does society make female rape victims feel worse about it then they would otherwise?\n\n\n\n_____\n\n"}, {"id": "cm7y1cy", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cm7y1cy", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cm7y55w", "body": "Yeah this is kinda what I'm talking about.

First off, the oil is being mined anyways- it's going to happen, period. This pipeline will do nothing but speed up the way it's transported, and make it safer than road-travel. Secondly, there's already a pipeline, it just takes a much less direct route. That's the whole point of the KXL, is to give it a direct route, with a faster flow. And finally, it will, in fact, create jobs. Mostly temporary, but some will be permanent. That point in itself is enough to get many people on-board, including myself.

As others have pointed out, the tar sands have both a low EROI and a high ecologic impact (when compared to other petroleum sources).\n\n\nSo for some people, efforts to retard the progress of this petroleum type by defeating attempts at streamlining its transportation and sale are logical efforts.\n\n\nBut for me the biggest argument is that when you invest heavily in infrastructure, your are essentially carving ruts in the energy supply that you need to justify using. If green energy sources aren't competitive in price to black energy sources, investing in infrastructure for the black resources steepens this divide. The conversation will endlessly be: \"well, it's just not economic to invest in green energy sources\" if you continually invest more in black energy sources. Now, I'm realistic about the matter, I know that green energy is not where it needs to be yet. That has as much to do with the current green technology as it simply has to do with our electricity grid.\n\n\nBut I do think that if you are planning on making the switch over a long period of time, you can at least make incremental steps along the way. You can invest in natural gas infrastructure and technologies (aerodynamic nat-gas freight trucks, consumer vehicles, nat-gas stations, etc.) as we are already seeing a lot of objective benefits from our fracking boom. Investing in tar sands is, in a way, a back step.\n\n\nTar sands require a much greater amount energy to extract, and require a huge amount of water to utilize, and have a much greater ecological impact. Basically, if you are going to choose a black energy source, tar sands are a crummy option. So I believe there are real, sound arguments to voting against a project that supports tar sands over superior alternatives.\n\n\nThat plus all the other good points people have already made."}, {"id": "2muqkt", "body": "I see no reason that the KXL should be so hated, besides the (in my opinion unjust, but that's a topic for another CMV) practice of Imminent Domain being used.

First off, the oil is being mined anyways- it's going to happen, period. This pipeline will do nothing but speed up the way it's transported, and make it safer than road-travel. Secondly, there's already a pipeline, it just takes a much less direct route. That's the whole point of the KXL, is to give it a direct route, with a faster flow. And finally, it will, in fact, create jobs. Mostly temporary, but some will be permanent. That point in itself is enough to get many people on-board, including myself. Again, my only complaint is the use of Imminent Domain, but that's not a thing that's going away any time soon.\n\nBut if anyone has any unmentioned reasons, then I'd be happy to hear them.

No one has the means to reproduce his dish like he would and that's why the finished product is unique. This just isn't true for a digital recording of a pop song!

"}, {"id": "cm8ybpp", "body": "It should not extend because it discourages people from creating content.\n\nTo start from the beginning, the end-purpose of law is not to protect rights that have been agreed. The end-purpose of law (often enacted through giving people rights etc.) is to encourage certain actions, and discourage others. The purpose of the legal system isn't specifically to enforce the bill of rights, the bill of rights is part of a legal system whose purpose is to (among other things) stop people from stealing other people's things and keeping slaves. This is the reason that rights can be amended in law - **rights are not the end-point of any legal system, they are a means to an end.**\n\nSo what we need to look at isn't whether we're somehow violating a purchaser's 'rights', we need to look at what those rights are there for. The purpose of intellectual property law as it stands is to encourage the creation of new intellectual property. The way it does this is that it attempts to enforce the ability of content-creators to make money from things they have created. The reason it does this is that although some people create content purely vocationally, and don't care about making a living, the majority of content-creators do so, at least in part, because they know they can make a living from it.\n\nAllowing people to gain access to new content without paying the creator significantly limits the ability of the content-creator to make a living off of their work. If they can't make a living off of creating content, they'll get jobs doing other things, and less content will be created.\n\nEssentially, letting people get access to content for free, regardless of whether you want to call it 'stealing' or 'copying' or 'pirating', reduces the ability of the people who make content to make money from doing so. If they can't make money from making content, they'll stop doing it and do something else. I don't know about you, but I kind of enjoy getting new content in the form of new tv shows, music etc. and I'm not in favour of changing the legal climate in such a way that a lot of people stop making new things."}, {"id": "cm7ttx2", "body": "No, it's people coming up with noble-sounding excuses to get shit for free.

I think the logical thing to do it make the price appropriate, make it a small price for a near free item. This way you can make micro sales and pay the costs of the original production and distribution. \n\nWhat music companies and movie companies do is try to charge as much as they can. This makes piracy the logical alternative as that movie is not likely to be worth the $20 they are asking for. I would pay $1 for every movie I want without an issue. I would not pay $20, and I am well aware that these companies do a lot of dodgy shit to try and stop copying of movies, so I don't feel bad pirating their stuff. But a smaller band needs your money to get off the ground, so pirating their music only makes sense if you are going to disseminate it with the goal of increasing demand for their live performances which is where most smaller bands make their money. \n\n&gt;&gt;Are you pirating as a pure form of protest?\nOr are you pirating to get stuff for free?\n\n&gt;I pay for Netflix, Rdio, Hulu Plus, and HBO. I purchase games through the Humble Bundles and on Steam. When I pirate content that is available through these services. I wouldn't say it's pure protest, but more a desire to have the freedom to do what I like with the information available to me. And yes, I fill in the gaps as well, something that is only available through iTunes won't play on a chromecast, but the pirated version will. So to reiterate:\n\n&gt;&gt;Are you pirating as a pure form of protest?\nOr are you pirating to get stuff for free?\n\n&gt;Honestly a bit of both.\n\nMe too"}, {"id": "cm8lruk", "body": "&gt;&gt;Is copying something the same as sharing it?\n\n&gt;Yes.\n\nI think this position lacks finesse and clarity. Sharing something can mean having a shared viewing, discussing, showing, but not giving. A person cannot retain a perfect copy of information directly in their brain easily, so sharing onwards is harder, it is a lossy process. \n\nCopying gives a perfect copy of the information, meaning they have the exact same as what you have. While I always want to give people the best possible thing rather than a degraded quality item, copying is by definition not sharing, however you can say they are very similar and related. \n\n&gt;&gt;Is there a scale of value between sharing information and selling information?\n\n&gt;I don't believe information should be sold.\n\nWhy and why not? \n\nKnowledge about the universe should not be sold, knowledge about medicine or law or any other academic pursuit should be free for everyone. But that is not the type of information in media. You have to be honest about the difference. Media is entertainment, something made for enjoyment. It does not directly enhance our understanding of the world, however it can be argued that the aggregate of understanding modern culture is a part of knowledge. \n\nEither way, it is a fine line, and I really do think some things fall on one side or another of that line. \n\n&gt;&gt;Is it important to make money from information?\n\n&gt;This is a little more complicated. Making money from applying information (such as using a design to make a chair and selling it) is absolutely a good thing. Making money from selling information directly is a little more complex. If one were to sell designs for a chair, once one design was sold the rest of the world could learn to make a chair that way. In order to profit from the design the transfer of that information must be restricted, so it is not money being made from information, but instead money being made from a forced artificial scarcity of that information.\n\nI agree about artificial scarcity when it comes to directly replicable information.

I am actually enrolled in a Boot camp come January in the pnw."}, {"id": "2mukd3", "body": "A coding boot camp is an unaccredited for-profit company which offers to train members of the public in the basics of programming, in return for an up-front fee (as much as $17,000 USD) and/or a cut of the trainee's eventual wage. I think that coding bootcamps are an inevitable consequence of low barriers to entry. There are relatively high-paying positions available, and they don't require any sort of degrees or professional licensing. The only requirement is that candidates have enough basic programming knowledge to get past interview screening - and just about anyone can learn enough to do it.\n\nThe first issue I see is that of motivation. I argue that any programmer worth hiring has a fierce independent interest in the topic. I think that coding bootcamps attract people with the promise of salary (\"make $80,000/year!\") instead of appealing to their intrinsic passion for the subject matter. Prior to these organizations, programmers who were hired (particularly those hired without degrees) were usually people who were attracted to the field by a love of programming. They usually had a long track record spanning many years because of this. Boot campers, on the other hand, may only be interested enough to get their foot in the door to a cushy career. After all, that's what the bootcamp promised when they took their money.\n\nSecondly, I don't see this massive influx of people who know how to write for-loops as solving the need for programmers. The industry has more than enough entry-level people available, even after you eliminate the majority of them who can't even pass the fizzbuzz test. The positions that desperately need to be filled are the ones which require very high-level people, with many years of specialized experience.\n\nLastly, I don't see the value in these faux-credentials over, say, a free online tutorial. I think that self-directed learning is probably the better option, given that these boot camps usually pigeon-hole learners into some pseudo-trendy stack (usually involving Ruby on Rails, for some god forsaken reason). If you self-taught, you might find that you don't even want to do web after all, and start learning enterprise java.

Equality is supposed to be about \"what you get, I get\" not \"We have to continually make shit easier for women\".\n\nAnd it's not even little girls complaining- it's adult women complaining on little girls' behalves. \n\nThis whole \"girls have it too hard, we have to be easier on girls\" movement literally makes them not my equal and since more is expected of boys and men, they're better.\n\nEquality should be about raising women's bar to the men's bar level, not treating women like they're the emotional equivalent of a faberge egg."}, {"id": "cm7o80x", "body": "Well, feminists generally don't approve of GI-Joe or He-Man-like figures either, so I am not sure what the issue is.

I tried to look up annual sales, and couldn't find the figures. I did find out that the 12\" figures were discontinued in 2009, so the \"counterpart\" to Barbie doesn't even exist. You can still get GI Joe, but only in the 3.75\" size. In comparison, sales of Barbie have fallen to $1.3 billion each year.\n\nSo they probably get more pressure from their daughters to buy them Barbie's than they do from their sons to buy them GI Joes. Also, girls play with Barbie's by pretending Barbie is a normal woman, boys play with GI Joe by pretending Joe is a soldier (you can't even change the clothes on 3.75\" scale Joe figures). Not only is there more of a fantasy element to pretending to be an extreme soldier, feminists probably aren't as inclined to buy their sons war toys anyway.\n\nTL;DR: Barbie gets more focus because she is more popular."}, {"id": "cm8nd1m", "body": "How come femminists only put barbie in a blender then?
