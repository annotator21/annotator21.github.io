It's kind of a dorky shirt, but hey, I don't judge.  It's probably not appropriate for your TV interviews as a representative of the scientists that just put a rover on a comet, but again, your choices are yours.  But the backlash against this poor guy was such that he apologized, crying, for ever daring to wear the thing.  He was lambasted and belittled, all for daring to have zero fashion sense.\n\nThis seems utterly ridiculous to me, and also, I feel, presents something of a double standard.  I think if a woman had shown up in the public eye in that outfit, she would at worst have been called tasteless.  In some circles she likely even would have been lauded.

I do consider NASCAR a physically demanding sport. However, I think a large percent of the population, when compared to other sports, have the physical tools to drive professionally.\n\nTL;DR - Being a NASCAR driver isnt that hard\n\nEdit: A lot of people are asking the question, if NASCAR is so easy, why dont more people do it? I do think it takes time to become a professional, and most people dont have the flexibility of life to simply drop everything and train to become a NASCAR driver. If they had all day to sit around and practice, perhaps they could\n\nEdit 2: In 2005, nearly 1/3 (23/76) of all NASCAR cup series drivers had family connections. Meanwhile there have been 364 brother pairs and close to 50 father/son pairs EVER in the NFL, and those numbers are before taking out groups like Archie, Peyton, and Eli or Howie, Chris, and Jake. This represents much less than 10% of the total NFL player base. I see this as meaning that there are high barriers of entry to NASCAR that overcome by social means instead of skill alone. \n\nEdit 3: Best phrasing of my argument so far: the ratio of people who could drive NASCAR professionally versus the total number of people is much higher than for other sports. Another barrier to entry is that many fewer people have the opportunity to test their skill driving professionally as compared to playing other sports.

I have never understood the notion that ethics is somehow innately bound up with culture, as if culture was itself a bounded, discrete unit 100% responsible for the ethical content of an individual. I think it is a result of anthropologists wildly exaggerating the significance of culture relative to our own meaning. In short, it is a logical failure to acknowledge that individual ethics are not wholly bounded within the unit \"culture\" just as not all fast things are cars even though many fast things are cars. It is possible to have a sense of ethics quite apart from your culture, and the fact that our culture may *inform* our sense of ethics does not in itself mean that they are wholly synonymous. I think this places far too much importance on an idea that is in reality just a convenient way to conceive of an abstraction, culture, that does not actually meaningfully exist as a discrete entity. Treating what amounts to an arbitrary classification as having such overwhelming power is to me a rather bizarre way of conceiving of the world. "}, {"id": "cm3108x", "body": "Okay, fair enough.

By adhering to those core principles in a less inconsistent manner, moral progress is possible. Let's use feminism in the US as an example. Equality was important to the american culture long before women were treated equally. This was because the culture applied the principle of equality in an inconsistent manner (white men had a higher position in society than black people or women). These cultural norms were based on factual inaccuracies or incoherent moral reasoning. By getting rid of these two factors(or at least trying to), the american culture was more in line with its core values. I would argue that it had therefore experienced moral progress. Of course, this progress can't really go that far, as I don't think moral relativism allows for the changing of those core values, but it is progress nonetheless. \n\n"}, {"id": "cm2uv64", "body": "I can get the gist of this objection, that there are fundamental or superordinate values that members of a culture can appeal to in opposition to established cultural practces that are, after examination, in contradiction to those superordinate values.  Progress of a limited sort can occur through such a means.\n\nBut the privileging of these values and the assertion that whatever is valued by a society is right for that society is indefensibly arbitrary as a system of ethics."}, {"id": "2mbv93", "body": "Cultural relativism, in its normative sense, is that there is cultural variation in terms of what is considered good and bad **and** also that this difference is *right* or desirable state for the culture in question.  The view states that it is *good* that cultures abide by their idiosyncratic definition of the good.  Proponents of normative cultural relativism would also tend to hostility to those who would impose one set of cultural valuations on another culture.\n\nThis view is problematic for several reasons.  Firstly, it treats all change as being wrong, but then right as that change becomes established and institutionalised within a culture.\n\nTake for instance the position of women in society- for the longest time, women had no political representation and very little in the way of codified rights.  What would a relativist have to say about such a state of affairs?  Nothing, of course, except to convey a blithe sense of pluralistic approval.   However, English moral philosophers (particularly of utilitarian bent) like Bentham and Mill argued from their principles that women deserve political representation and rights **a hundred years in anticipation of feminism**.  The relativist is bound to decrying this moral foresight as lunacy on part of those that first conceived of it, or as a wicked sort of moral perversion.  If the culture is always right, morality is mob rule.\n\nFurther, the intuition that we should live and let live, abstaining from enforcing our beliefs and will on other cultures is self-defeating within the context of cultural relativism.  What if my culture approves of violent and exploitative colonialism?  It does not follow from the view that all culture's ethical beliefs are \"right for them\" that the violent imposition of my own cultural values is wrong.  Further, it would seem to state that my culture (or at least its attitude to colonialism) actually is wrong in some objective sense.  This is a completely arbitrary specification.\n\nWe can be moral realists whilst taking into account cultural differences.  If in culture A, dying one's hair purple is grievously hurtful to a lot of people but in culture B it is not, then that behaviour assumes a different moral importance relative to culture.  But this leaves room for moral realism and ethical systems like consequentialism without arbitrarily asserting the ethical supremacy of culture.

Rapid and fundamental upheaval of any given culture will lead to instability - for the most part people adapt their cultural values when they are young, and hold these values into their old age, if you have two different demographics (young and old) holding two fundamentally different and opposed sets of cultural values you are going to experience massive conflict.  We see the effects forced rapid progressiveness across many African and Middle Eastern countries - the Europeans came in, instilled their culture and their values, this broke their cultures and led to centuries of unrest.  \n\nCultural relativism isn't about who is right and who is wrong, it's about finding the best way for a culture to move forward without collapsing.

It also features white actors in blackface, playing up racist stereotypes, and portrays the KKK as heroes - inspiring the revival of the Klan in the 19teens, not to mention numerous protests, riots, and hate crimes. No critic or historian of film would deny its artistic significance, but it's always going to have that asterisk (at best), and you can't even make a serious commentary about the stupendous aspects without addressing the horrible ones.\n\nWhat makes a film \"good\"? Your underlying point that direction, cinematography, acting, writing are all separable from themes and motivation is true, of course. But that doesn't mean those aspects, or others like a lack of casting and writing diversity (with respect to gender or anything else), aren't part of our holistic assessment.\n\n---\n\nOr look at it another way: there are different kinds of people in the audience, who respond to different things. Much of what makes or breaks a film is that it has a \"relatable\" character. If you're a man, you may find every member of a largely male cast relatable and you might not even notice what's missing. If you're a woman, you don't just casually fail to notice that there aren't any women in the story doing anything interesting (especially since you've spent your whole life affected by hard-to-not-notice gender disparities, but that's another story). It sticks out like a sore thumb, the same as if you're an English person watching a movie that takes place in the UK and everyone has American accents - even though the occasional American might not notice. It requires more suspension of disbelief than usual.\n\nAnd then we wonder why the writers did that. (If you're spending the movie wondering about the motivations of the writers then they've already failed.) Is the film set in a men's prison? A historical warzone? A monastery? No? Then why does the entire plot and dialogue seem to happen only to male characters? It's quite a coincidence that the character-gender coinflip came up the same way every time - and in fiction we abhor unnecessary coincidences, because they're characteristic of lazy writing. Bechdel failure is entirely preventable with the slightest awareness, and then you don't needlessly alienate half the film audience.\n\nEDIT: a couple of important words I missed"}, {"id": "2mbd49", "body": "I was talking with a friend earlier, who had talked with one of her own friends (talk about second-hand discussion!) about a movie I had recently seen, Big Hero 6.
