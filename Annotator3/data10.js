It's a great tool for self defense because of those reasons.\n\nThinking it has no place in the modern world is simply ridiculous."}, {"id": "2nn1t8", "body": "I'm quite pro gun and argue about guns regularly on reddit. I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun.

If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff.

So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don\u2019t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let\u2019s pretend, ok?) , they\u2019d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \n\n**Thanks**\n\nHelp me out, guys.

After all, she is the one who can get pregnant, not the other way around. If the guy wants to help with the cost that's fine, in fact it is preferred. But the woman should ultimately be responsible for it. \n\nI know this isn't an overly popular opinion, but if you are having sex then you should be responsible for the consequences. For women this means that they should be responsible for any pregnancy, planned or unplanned. If a woman chooses to have sex and she gets pregnant, even if she was on birth control, it isn't right to force the man to pay for it, nor to force his insurance to pay for it. Even if there were a male birth control pill, she has no way of knowing whether he is on it or not, she has to trust him. Therefor, the only way to be reasonably secure against marriage is for the woman to be on birth control. \n\nFor abortion, it is a procedure happening to the woman, and is ultimately her choice, not his. If she chooses to get an abortion then she should have to pay for it, not him. \n\nSimilar arguments follow for Plan B. She knew the risk of getting pregnant if she had sex, so she should have to be responsible for them. If she is raped it is of course a different story.

In that case, arguing that the truth is 'between the two sides' is just derailing and equivocating. It's pointless resistance against the right answer during the conflict, and gives undue credibility to the losing side after the fact.\n\nAlso common: both sides are wrong, as are all the points between them. Often, the correct (or best) answer is a third position that doesn't closely resemble either position. In this case, arguing that the truth is between the two sides limits flexibility in thinking, and arguing after the fact that the correct answer represents a meeting point between the sides gives unearned credit to both wrong groups.\n\nAlso common: both sides are wrong, but one side is less wrong, and the best answer is an even more extreme version of the less wrong side, and very much not in between the two sides that are being advanced. \n\n[EDIT 10 p.m. EST: I'm going to bed now.

In fact, I just gave the one definition: Right and wrong refer to actions or entities in terms of their relationship to the goal of a narrative.  That definition means what is right and what is wrong varies based on the narrative you're attempting to advance, but it doesn't, under any circumstances, ever, define right and wrong in more than one way at the same time.\n\n&gt;As I understand it you define things that are factually wrong as morally wrong, as well as things that are morally wrong, or do you only define things that are factually wrong as morally wrong?\n\nNope. You've got it backwards.\n\n**Factually wrong** is a statement that is incorrect.\n\n**Morally wrong** is a thing that works against the goal of the presumed narrative.\n\n**Factual** wrongness informs **moral** wrongness because being factually, mechanically wrong about how to achieve your goals results in taking actions that are neutral to or work counter to the goals of your narratives.\n\n&gt;So are we talking about objective morality here? Religious idea? God(s) created morals?\n\nNo, not even a little bit. I said I believe in an external **reality,** not an external **morality.** What I meant was that I don't think an internally consistent narrative is automatically valid, and I don't think that the world exists entirely as a construct of my own mind.\n\nI feel like your confusion on that point was a major building block of your response.\n\n&gt;You cannot define something too broadly, like you have below, because you run into to many conflicts and you end up creating a definition of something no one can argue out of.\n\nThe thing about narratives wasn't really a point for contesting -- it was a narrative construct. The idea is not \"Morality is a metaphysical component of narratives, which are real things that exist in external space.\" The idea is \"All narratives have this quality, which is easily described as 'right and wrong' in larger, more sophisticated narratives, but there's no corresponding word for that phenomenon in narrower or smaller narratives, so it's useful to expand the idea of 'right and wrong' to include that quality's manifestation in those smaller narratives.\""}, {"id": "cmeu2mm", "body": "In my experience, it's generally more complicated than that.

Okay, so you're saying you're right that it's about reconciliation because the successful organizing of a revolution requires cooperation, but it doesn't defeat your point that the end goal of that revolution is the violent overthrow of an opposing side?\n\nYou're just narrowing down or expanding the scale of each of the possible alternatives until you find a link in the chain that resembles your point. The fact that reconciliation is a thing that exists doesn't discredit the existence of conflict, of argument for the sake of pursuing truth, of genuinely irreconcilable differences of opinion, and so on.\n\n&gt;you can't fight a battle/war on two fronts. \n\nYes you can? People do it all the time. \n\nAlso, this military metaphor is problematic if you're trying to defend the goal of arriving at the truth, because the winner in a military conflict isn't the people who are most in the right; it's the people who most effectively inflict an extraordinary amount of violence on the other people.\n\n&gt;the UN debates are getting more controversial i see. representative government is a bit like arguments about truth, in the sense of the original quote, but often there is an issue of personality in it. so these disputes aren't about truth, but preference. escalation regarding preference has lower capacity for violence. and things about how large groups of people interact don't always work as well on an individual level.\n\nI don't understand how this addresses any part of the quote you put above it. An argument I have with my partner is not a UN debate. I'm defending abandoning the argument, not escalating it. And two people are not a large group.\n\n&gt;that is why you dissaggree with the original quote. it would be a strawman but i don't think you meant to misrepresent the quote. \n\nNo, it really isn't why I disagree with the original quote.

In that case, arguing that the truth is 'between the two sides' is just derailing and equivocating. It's pointless resistance against the right answer during the conflict, and gives undue credibility to the losing side after the fact.\n\nAlso common: both sides are wrong, as are all the points between them. Often, the correct (or best) answer is a third position that doesn't closely resemble either position. In this case, arguing that the truth is between the two sides limits flexibility in thinking, and arguing after the fact that the correct answer represents a meeting point between the sides gives unearned credit to both wrong groups.\n\nAlso common: both sides are wrong, but one side is less wrong, and the best answer is an even more extreme version of the less wrong side, and very much not in between the two sides that are being advanced. \n\n[EDIT 10 p.m. EST: I'm going to bed now.

If you believe sex-positivity to be a philosophy which specifically endorses non-monogamy, then yeah; of course.  If you just mean it to be literally positive about sex, then not necessarily.  You can be very positive about sex with one specific person.\n\n&gt;You still have friends even though you have a spouse, right?\n\nMe specifically?  I'm not married.  People in general, yes generally.  But you could also argue that that's the sign of a personality flaw.  You aren't interesting enough to keep your spouse occupied nor are you interested enough in your spouse for them to keep you occupied alone. \n\nPretty much any relationship type or life decision can be attributed to some kind of character flaw.

It's not really a jealousy issue so much as a fulfillment one. I want my partner to feel more or less complete. And so do I. I want to show this person my love and feel theirs. I don't want to need anybody else. \n\nI can't imagine someone who likes multiple partners being satisfied with someone who just wants them alone. That would probably seem clingy and restricting. I don't think it's wrong to be poly or mono. But I'd don't think the two are very compatible. I want to spend my free time with this person. I want to live with them and share a home. Build a life. I can't imagine that working if he was gone all the time trying to build other relationships. I guess I feel like the more partners you introduce the more it would dilute the experience of each relationship. Instead of having a shared life with one person you have to split your time, money, energy, thought across multiple people. Honestly it sounds exhausting and not very rewarding. \n\nAs for the friends again I think it's a separate issue. We are social creatures. We need to be around others. Two people alone are never going to work out because we need other social stimuli. The difference is intimacy level. \n\nDifferent people bring different opportunities and experiences. Having lots of friends can enrich your life. But I'm not living with them. I'm not spending all of my free time with them. I don't take them to every social gathering. I might hang out with a dozen different people in a week but there would often be one person present of all of them. And if he isn't there then I'm going home to him. It's hard to describe. For most people it seems intuitive though. There is an intimacy and closeness that you don't ever get with friends and flings. I might share my emotional part of me with friends and physical part of me with a fling but neither gets to see and experience both.\n\nYou can share both with multiple people but as I said I think it gets diluted that way. Because you'll have less time and energy to share these things with multiple people. And the only way I can imagine it working is if say three of us lived together as a single unit. But I personally don't want that. Not jealous or envy. I just don't care to be that intimate with more than one person. The more cooks in the kitchen the easier it is to mess up the meal.

Secondly our productivity due to mechanization has granted greater earning capacity, this is mostly what led to women's liberation, which has ultimately led to the divorce rate. Whether this is a good thing for raising children is largely still untested, time will be the final arbitrator of the new system's success. Pick a sample of hugely accomplished people, how many of them come from single parent families? I'd hypothesise that exceptional people are far more likely to come from a traditional family than not.\n\nYou're right, but it's due to a wealth discrepancy that informs the divorce rate. Controlling for all other factors, being born to wealthy/succesful parents is *by far* the single greatest predictor of wealth/success.\n\n&gt;A subset of males can focus on seed-sewing and avoid as much child rearing as possible at the expense of those who do. This makes such groups vulnerable to infiltration by males who don't stick around. \n\nPotentially, but I can't find any studies on this subject at all. If there were legal protections in place for poly families, I don't see why this would be any different/worse than single moms getting knocked up by being serially monogamous. I guess more kids would have a stronger family unit as a result. It's vaguely reminiscent of the gay uncle theory.\n\n&gt;You mention selfish genes, it's probably worth reading Dawkins's book on the subject where he discusses the mathematics of different child-rearing strategies and family structures.\n\nI'll add it to my considerable backlog."}, {"id": "2nlrqs", "body": "There are exceptions all over the place, but a successful non-monogamous relationship requires involved parties to grow and overcome things like jealousy, envy, insecurity, and possessiveness. \n\nFor this reason, I feel that the average person in a non-monogamous relationship will be of a stronger character than their monogamous counterpart.\n\nMore over, the reasons for being monogamous are exclusively character flaws related to the items mentioned above, or outright ignorance (about non-monogamy, about STIs, etc).\n\nCMV.\n\ne: /u/GnosticGnome changed my view with the very pragmatic position that for many flavors of non-monogamy, there are no legal protections to mitigate the risk of forming an economic partnership as there are with couples."}, {"id": "cmerkdy", "body": "Monogamy is a preference in relationships.

Yeah - people only hear about murdered Jews, but in fact few millions of Polish (non-Jewish) civillians died during German occupation, many in concentration camps, or during \"intelligentionakzion\" - Germans were rounding up Polish teachers, priests, lawyers, artists etc and shooting them by tousands in the forests.

I call it \"Potential Consequentialism.\" The basic idea is that one should choose what is most potentially consequential. I assume that, in this world, anything can happen.  Countries may be dissolved in the next few minutes. An original social idea may immediately take hold of millions of people and revolutionize local or international social orders in a few days. A small group with the right intellectual and technological capital may greatly alter the entire world economy. Anything can happen, though, as you can you see, I'm mainly concerned with things related to power or things concerning to changing status quos.\n\nThe idea has only a few similarities to \"opportunity cost\" which is more of an economic idea and does not delve deep enough into what \"potential\" means. \"Potential\" isn't about the immediate such as immediate economic gain, but is actually more linked with human potential and revolutionary, philosophical, social and technological ideas. This world, to me, is like a giant building with extremely durable steel metals to support it but to a keen eye, has small but very vulnerable sensitive points. If done right, this \"building\" could be easily demolished. \n\nSo, in choosing between investing one's time in creating a potentially revolutionary social and technological movement vs. earning several millions of dollars which will take 3 years, the most rational decision, according to potential consequentialism, is the former. \n\nIt must be noted that I do have a very high opinion of my abilities. \n_\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
