A large amount of the observations are self-fulfilling. A large amount of posters are angry/grieving and therefore are not the most...clear-headed. However there is still a reasonable amount of good advice - if you can sift it from the chaff.\n\nI believe in barking, barking has always protected me, barking will ensure my safety. - a dog.\n\nOne real red pill, that everyone should swallow, is that humans are animals, and therefore biased towards people with attractive physical attributes, even when they know they should not be. Another is that you cannot assume that a romantic partner will put you before themselves in every (or any) interaction. another is that some people will not be attracted to you.\n\nTRP distils everything down to a power struggle, and aims to be the most powerful in each interaction. A decisions made by you is better than any made by someone else.\n\nTRP seems to be the response to the idea that women should aggressively use their sexuality to bargain for a \"better\" life partner, marrying up etc. Naturally TRP seeks to counter this, dismissing women to just their sexuality. As a counter it works Exceptionally well. It however also has large collateral damage.\n\nsome of what the red pill says, is self fulfilling; if you have superficial relationships, and don't be surprised that they flake away. \n\nIt preaches that you are only as good as your perceived value, and that people will take advantage of kindness.\n\nIt also preaches that a guy should never be subservient to a girl. while this may encourage doormats to have some self respect, it also removes respect for women as logical humans. In the context of a work in progress, this might be palatable. contrast with \"you deserve better than him\"\n\nTRP is ruthlessly efficient with your dating demands also clears out a large suite of women who want a more substantial relationship, or have emotional issues, and collects the remainder who can broadly be divided into two camps, those who just want to fuck, and those who have so little self value that they attempt to have a relationship by using sex as a bargaining chip. Compare with a pickup artist looking to fuck and fuck off.\n\nThose who want a fuck-buddy wont care, and those who want a relationship will get burned.\n\nTRP is pseudo-science, and like most pseudo-science, it is based in fact, and then extrapolates to the ridiculous. Unfortunately they have also perfected the salesmans agreement close, get you agreeing with basic statements, then move into the dotty, and watch as the sucker keeps nodding his head in agreement.\n\nTRP is a crutch for people who want an excuse as to why their relationships fail, introspection is replaced by dogma. The answers might still be correct, but personal responsibility to a relationship is avoided. Failing to put effort into a relationship is replaced with \"Bitches only seek 'social+material value'\" this puts the blame of being lazy on \"a woman's instinct\" rather than the less palatable realisation that they took the relationship for granted. This leaves the red piller unaware of his failing, but still gets the correct response - more effort is put into maintaining themselves.\n\nThe success found in following this advice will reaffirm the dogma, and gently push them down the rabbit hole.\n\nTRP is a defence mechanism that assumes the worst in their partners in a bid to reduce their vulnerability. \n\nTRP preaches that women should not be put on a pedestal, and discourages obsession over one person. while this prevents the quite frightening professions of \"love\" from total strangers, and the grieving over the loss of the delusion, TRP continues along this line of thought, cutting out any hope for a complex fulfilling relationship by reducing female value to the sum of her attractiveness and the mental and emotional capabilities of a stunted 12 year old. \"the most responsible teenager in the house\"\n\nTRP also promotes a man of purpose, while this is useful to suggest to a passive rider, TRP fails to acknowledge that having passions is desirable, and that being busy prevents pillers from swamping someone you barely know with so much enthusiasm they are scared you escaped from an institution. and simply focuses on the fact that it is a convenient excuse to give women.\n\nTRP teaches \"abundance frame,\" the idea that a piller should pretend that he has lots of women vying for his attentions, and that women are natively attracted to men who have already been \"judged worthy\" by other women, ignoring entirely the fact that the piller may have previously allowed himself to fall \"in love\" with some idealised imagined version of a woman he has just met, and this \"abundance frame\" has just prevented the other action.\n\nTRP makes use of the fact that, if you are making the decisions about your life, and working on improving your \"perceived value\" it is very difficult to be a man-child simultaneously.\n\nTL;DR TRP is a crutch for man-children to grow up, and get laid more, mostly by stopping the piller from cock-blocking himself."}, {"id": "2lwrsv", "body": "Hello everyone, I'll prefice by saying English isn't my main language, so I apologize for any misunderstanding, feel free to ask what did I mean by saying 'X'.\n\nI discovered TRP a few months ago.

I look at posts there and they are insane to extremely negative. When you go on actual PUA forums like RSD's forum you see posts like \"is laughing at my own jokes that bad?\" \"how do I prevent someone from getting too attached\" etc. Real topics. Instead of all the women-shittalk posts on redpill. When I was into it I used juggler's forum myself, a friend used RSD which was also decent. \n\nThe other is its hard to sustain and some of the long term views are bad. The idea that you need to be constantly improving means you are kind of in a state of \"I'm not good enough\". This is EXTREMELY useful when in fact you are far from good enough, but can be mentally taxing. It was hard to constantly care about every little thing I said, every approach I didn't make or messed up etc and still give my 100% to school/career. \n\nSome of the views are pretty awkward. Basically they shun all introverted activities and at least back when I was into it night game was a bigger deal than day game (the former I generally dislike the latter I loved). It also kind of assumes talking to a random person is actually worth it. After awhile it felt like most people were rather boring, but the skill to be able to talk to a stranger is really useful for you do run into that one interesting person. I pretty much have no fear of embarrassment anymore, I get a huge kick out of very loudly (my voice is just always accidentally very loud) talking about embarrassing stories or some of the dorkier stuff I've done. Some of the pua community sort of supports this in a be proud of who you are way, but some of it is very restricting \"you have to be outgoing all the time, don't waste time on nerdy hobbies, don't hang out with nerds hang out with cool people, why aren't you doing more sets meeting more women\" etc. \n\nBasically its useful as fuck and absolutely amazing for \"catching up\" or \"crash course\" on socializing and being more confident and general self improvement. But it has its limits and negative aspects as well and after awhile seems like you go from one kind of slavery to another where you value things like \"be alpha fuck bitches get huge\" a bit too much. Balance I guess is really the answer.

The chance is small, so small it's negligible, but it's still possible.  If it does happen, does the Soldier who fired that round bare the responsibility of what happened to it?

To me that makes about as much sense as being charged with shoplifting because a cashier forgot to scan an item.  \n\nI expect many people might try to argue \"oh, well people will just claim they didn't know the age to get away with sleeping with somebody who is underage\", however I believe that it is much better to err on the side of not punishing an innocent person here and destroying their lives, rather than attempting to punish an adult for something that was done consensually.  Also, it should be pretty easy to tell in most cases whether the accused actually knew the person was underage or not.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Instead a discussion about premises and the way how we conclude our views from given premises should be much more rewarding.\n\nMost people will never do brain surgery or fly planes and many people will stay on boring menial jobs their whole life that many children could do. However those skills don't tell us about whether someone is able to decide for himself or is not.\n\nIt is true that time leads to experience. But only if one is free to make errors. Think about the following scenario: A child is about to touch a hotplate. He would only make the experience how hot the hotplate actually is of you let him. However, you can say something like \"Stop! You could injure yourself.\" which is a simple fact. If the child learns his lesson that way, that's not _experience_, it's _insight_, which happens to be the only form of learning that no other animal than the human is capable to. Some children still touch the hotplate and learn their lesson the hard way, but that wouldn't be a valid reason to lock up the children as long as you cook or something crazy like that. The point is, the next day, the child definitely will be able to make the decision for touching or not touching the hotplate. Even if it's only, let's say, a 5-year-old. Some children may forget the fact that a hotplate may be extremely hot and touch it repeatedly, but it's not that they wouldn't know not to touch a hot hotplate, it's just because they didn't know when a hotplate is hot or cold. But they will that learn too and soon associate the hotness with the right herd controls.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that a lack of information does not show that someone is not able to decide correctly given the information he knows. Nearly everyone, including nearly every child is able to decide correctly, but is limited to his own information. Testing children for simple problems (like text problems in math) may be a good way to test the decision making ability of someone. (And I agree that let's say a baby is of course not able to it correctly in most circumstances.)\n\nSince having sex is a pretty important decision, it's right to require the ability for _informed_ decisions. So the next big step would be to offer neutral and helpful information about sex. This would be one requirement for making sex consensual - of course check the child's understanding of it. Of course only if the child wants to be informed. Which leads me to my next point: The ability to consent _is_ the ability to say \"no\", even in fear of consequences - which is the foundation for the argumentation behind the abuse of power disparities between children and their trusted persons. So, my proposal is that the most trusted person(s), the parents in most cases, would have to be informed. If the parents say \"You are not allowed to have sex with x\" and the child can honestly answer \"But I want to, I won't listen to you.\" (This is the \"no\" I am meaning) then the child therefore shows that he is able to give consent freely without fear of consequences. Since there may be cases where the parents are the one who are pushing their children to have sex, either with them or with strangers, which is barbaric nonetheless, I'd require another trusted person (a teacher for example).\n\nI believe those three mentioned points (intelligence test, sex education and the ability to object/reject trusted persons) should be a necessity for sex being regarded as consensual. All of them can and should be observed by teachers and doctors. It is independent of age, but of course in all cases I could imagine, no 5-year-old could ever pass.

That exemplifies that the grading system is based on grades rather than the actual work students are putting in.\nAlthough the education system is flawed, it is still a huge staple in society.

There are times when I have gotten pretty far in a course with a pretty basic misunderstanding of something early on. If I hadn't started getting something unexpectedly wrong later on then it's entirely possible that I wouldn't have realized that there was something that needs correcting. If not for grades, something else would have to take this place.\n\nAlso, what about people who don't go out and hunt down video tutorials? I mean, some people are in it because they have to be as opposed to having a true passion for that particular subject matter. Other people are in it because they need a passing understanding of this to get to what they really want to be doing. How would whatever system that replaces grades help them out?\n\nThere are a lot of teachers. Some of them are better than others. How can you separate those teachers who are genuinely bad from those who are merely unpopular? Well, grades are one way. When students persistently underperform it's a good way for an administrator who cannot possibly sit down and observe each teacher often enough to figure out the quality for his/herself (and trying to do so would be prohibitively expensive) to determine that the work of the teacher is lacking. Conversely when students score well it's a pretty good time that the teacher is preparing the students for the test. There can be a difference between \"imparting knowledge\" and \"preparing for the test\" but it's not a particularly big one.\n\nStudents do have a lot of stress, but students really need to learn how to manage time. Homework mimics the kind of time sensitivity and low oversight they will have to cope with in many jobs. Additionally, repetition is essential to learning, often times it takes doing a kind of problem a number of times for it to really be understood and devoting class time to repeating the same problem is impractical as there often isn't enough time to cover the necessary subjects as is. I am all for reducing stress levels for students, but not at the cost of teaching time management skills and the necessity of practice to understand the class subject early in live. In fact, failure to develop those skills is a major contributor to that stress.\n\nIf those things were rationed by grades then they would be rationed by something else. It's better to trace them to something that students change by effort than to limit them by something outside student control, like geography or ethnicity.\n\nNot all tests are multiple choice, many are essay or short answer. Or, they have been to my memory. Multiple choice tests are simply faster to take and grade, so they are used where applicable. Moreover, how is this an issue with grading?\n\nPeople aren't graded on work? I have always lost points when I don't show work. Moreover, how is this a problem with grading?\n\nYou'd be facing an uphill battle if you miss a few days in any event. At least when you are dealing with grades you have a number value measure about how bad off you are. This is one of those cases where knowing is better than not knowing.\n\nReally, without having an alternative program that is as useful to students, teachers, and administrators as grading is to judge how effectively information has been transferred there really isn't a choice. Grades offer obvious benefits, even if how they are implemented is sometimes problematic. Removing all accountability from both students and teachers isn't going to improve the quality of education of the average person, and it is very likely to reduce it."}, {"id": "2lw8kl", "body": "I'm going to admit from the beginning that I'm currently a student tired of being in the system, so that bias may shine through, but I'm not really sure that the current educational system with grades is effective.

With homework, there isn't really that chance. Because it's a grade, it's an assessment. It's asking \"did you understand what we did in class and can you get this correct\" rather than asking \"what didn't you understand and where can we grow\".\n\nBut prior to a test, you should already be asking yourself the latter. What parts are you not understanding? The tests also evaluate your ability to iron out the details you don't understand under a certain timeframe. If given an infinite amount of time, surely everyone would be able to learn from their mistakes. But at the beginning of the semester, they tell you term test 1 is on November 21st. You have until then understand what you can't, and work on what you don't understand. In short, grades can also be interpreted as an evaluation of how well you CAN learn from your mistakes. A better argument would be to make everything cumulative, but only consider the final grade (and hence the overall improvement) because those who learn from their mistakes should experience an upwards trend to an A+, figuratively speaking.\n\n&gt;They pull students down, and for a lot of students who want to get into colleges and get scholarships, the thought of a bad grade on homework which should be helping us learn is just stress that we might fail and be punished for life because of it.\n\nYou mentioned earlier that you understand grades are used to evaluate whether one knows enough to move further into a subject. If they received a bad grade, would that not suggest (not indicate) the student is inadequately prepared for college? The thought of a bad grade does add stress. However, having stress can be helpful as well. Yerkes-Dodson Law (I remembered it as the Yankee-Doodle Law for Psychology 100! Haha!) states that having either low or high stress will impair your performance. With no stress, you simply don't care. There aren't consequences. With high stress, you can't focus. Grades do contribute to the stress that students like you and I carry every day. But without any stress of performing well, we may not work as seriously. Excessive stress doesn't inflict everyone and can't really be generalized in the way you seem to be aiming for.\n\n&gt;A lot of subjects simply don't make sense with multi-choice exams and tests. Classes like English and History often ask \"what is the best answer\" which doesn't prove if people had the knowledge and intellect to reason, only that they can think like the exam writer. I much prefer short answer.\n\nIf you've taken logic tests like the LSAT, you can see how there is a definite answer in a multiple choice exam for topics like English. It is based on the ability of the reader to critically analyze the passage for explicit hints and implicit messages. Even if it is ambiguous, being able to rule out other options as impossible due to the criteria given also shows your ability to understand the passage. In this way, a multiple choice exam is still a valid way of testing classes that don't initially seem to fit with it.\n\n&gt;Maths and Science answers can often be ruined by a single step in an equation, so should be graded on the work not the final answer.\n\nI agree with this. I believe many TAs and professors already adopt this thinking. I haven't met anyone (except those in engineering) who focus solely on the answer. I can understand why engineers may need to, as having the right work is great but meaningless if your one misstep is going to lead to the deaths of \"x\" people. The penalty shouldn't be as great as you suggest, but it emphasizes the need for them to verify their work, for the safety and security of those affected by their work in the future.\n\n&gt;They suck the passion out of students, which is the opposite of what you want from someone you're trying to teach. I've seen friends bite off more than they can chew and it just destroyed them.\n\nYou might have to elaborate on this point. I'm reluctant to comment on it because I don't know if I fully understand your argument. But it seems to me that you're saying people are focusing on getting good grades instead of learning. And in that respect I would agree with you that it's not the greatest mentality. But one would think that if a student did focus on learning, and learned the material, would they not have a high grade as well? It might just be the approach taken by students. If they were wired to understand that grades reflected their learning of the material and not their ability to do the test, the same grade you attempt to besmirch could also be seen as diagnostic of their learning.\n\n&gt;If you miss a few days, you end up fighting an uphill battle which makes all of your work worse as you try to both catch up on missed assignments and keep up with incoming ones.\n\nThat's not an argument for why grades make education less effective. Lack of time management and inability to make up for your mistakes is what's making education less effective here.

The main issue with testing is that it forces the student not to learn what they want to learn, not to learn what is useful for them personally (its different for every person and their goals), but learn what is going to be on the test.\n\nTests are usually very retarded. Any test that isn't open book almost certainly has components in it that are a waste of time completely. Why are we still forcing students to memorize often very random and useless facts that are going to be immediately forgotten after the class or hell the day after the test when we can now look anything up almost instantly. Usually its because making tests is a pain and professors aren't the best at it. Its much easier to think of a simple \"what is X\" than actually make a question that involves true understanding and things you can't look up easily. \n\nStudents are generally paying a shitton of money to go to college to actually learn something or boost their resume. How is memorizing random facts that are useless doing either? People sometimes say \"OH STUDENTS ARE LAZY THEY JUST WANT THE EASIEST CLASS EVER\" but that is hilariously not true, especially in middle to top tier universities. Students want to take classes that will get them the internships and jobs they want. They usually have a much better idea of what they need to learn specifically to get there than a professor does for a random student. I say this as someone who has gone to both public and ivy league schools. Its the same in both, students aren't lazy idiots, they are smart and most of the time realize that memorizing what temperature Taq Polymerase functions at optimally is completely a waste of time and if you ever did need to know (which you almost certainly won't) you could look it up then instead of memorizing 2423432 random facts preemptively.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIn fact I would say that kids that complain or do mediocre shitty tests are smarter than the kids who do well. They know deep down how useless the knowledge on the test is and so their brain just doesn't want to do it. Meanwhile hyper-submissive does what they are told can't think for themselves other student does excellent. Ofc this is an exaggeration (I got straight As), usually the straight A student is just someone who HAS to get good grades for one reason or another and is aware of how stupid some classes and tests can be but are willing to bite the bullet for their end goals. \n\nFuck I hate how horribly inefficient almost all classes are.

A grade of 75% on a math test means, roughly, you could correctly answer 75% of the questions. This isn't completely accurate, as a grade isn't made solely from answering questions, but that's the rough idea behind it. \n\nA lot of the other problems are personal and on a case by case basis. For example, when I was in High-school and college, most of the homework was done with the expectations that (1) you should get all or almost all of the questions correct, and that's because (2) you had the ability to use your resources to answer the questions. Any math problem can be solved with the internet now, including the work you need to do for it, but barring that, most of them can be checked by going over your answers and making sure everything makes sense. You can also often work with other people or get assistance form the teacher / prof if you really need it (I know I sure had to suck up my pride and ask for help in some subjects). Your English and History thing can vary too: The answer choices can range from obviously wrong to possibly correct in certain cases. The choices depend on the teacher. With math, my teachers/ professors gave partial credit based on your work.

I don't think any people are different because of their appearance, nationality, or religion. I *do* however believe that like people stick together even in multicultural countries like the U.S. and our cultural differences are still there.\n\nI don't think that European people hold a lot of power in the world while third world countries exist because we oppressed or exploited them. I think it's pretty evident that Greco-Roman ideas helped jumpstart our civilization. While some people like to argue that \"throughout history whites oppress other races, from the beginning of time\" thats really not true. White people were pretty much at the same place as everybody else until Rome. Pretty much everywhere that the Romans conquered was inhabited by white people. It was Greco-Roman ideas that surfaced after the fall of the Roman empire that gave us things like empiricism and rationalism, as you all know. \n\nWhite people started to become really \"oppresivish\" during the colonial era, which a lot of people also like to talk about. Well during this time, thanks to navigation, European powers started exploring and their influence began to stretch across the ocean. Trade became more global and not limited to neighbors. Enlightenment thinkers started thinking about shit like the nature of government and the economy. The latter was really important because Mercantilism was pretty much the school of thought that ruled the era. Because of mercantilism, colonies were good, and they traded with their colonies for raw goods that nobody else could have. Both sides were benefitting from this trade, mind you, even Africa was making money. So with all this thinking about politics, the stage became much more global, and the Europeans knew how to play it thanks to all these new ideas from the Enlightenment era. When people talk about how \"white people start all these horrible wars and blah blah blah blah\", what they're talking about wars that are much larger scale than the ones fought by third world countries like the world wars or the seven years war. The reason why these wars happen on such a huge scale is because Europeans are much more involved in global politics because of the enlightenment era. \n\nThird world countries exist today because they really don't want change socially and let go of old cultural traditions. For instance, in the Middle East they're still fighting age old wars over religion and cultural differences, and in Africa the people can't establish a stable governments because the people don't want to die and the people leading the civil wars are only interested in their own benefit. Some places that were just as exploited as the Middle East/Africa or arguably even more so are hugely powerful today. Despite the fact that the Brits basically turned their country into a massive drug den, China is a massive economic and military power. Japan was also \"exploited\" by Europe, but they also came out a massive military power that competed in the second world war. Its because they went out and modernized the shit out of themselves with some proper leadership.\n\nI think that today, the racial disparity in the United States and elsewhere can be blamed more on our cultures than our skin color. There are a lot of rich white people. But there are also a lot of rich indian and asian immigrants as well. Indian and asian americans make ~$26,000 and ~$12,000 dollars more, respectively, on average than \"whites\". Then, African Americans make $20,000 less on average than whites, and hispanics make ~$10,000 less. The argument is supposed to be that immigrants are put down and the evil white capitalists exploit the minorities for money.\n\nThink about this for a second. Asians come from a culture where hard work and honor is highly valued. Indians come from a culture where doing your best in society is extremely important. Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don't have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles.

I think it's pretty evident that Greco-Roman ideas helped jumpstart our civilization. While some people like to argue that \"throughout history whites oppress other races, from the beginning of time\" thats really not true. White people were pretty much at the same place as everybody else until Rome. Pretty much everywhere that the Romans conquered was inhabited by white people. It was Greco-Roman ideas that surfaced after the fall of the Roman empire that gave us things like empiricism and rationalism, as you all know. \n\nWhite people started to become really \"oppresivish\" during the colonial era, which a lot of people also like to talk about. Well during this time, thanks to navigation, European powers started exploring and their influence began to stretch across the ocean. Trade became more global and not limited to neighbors. Enlightenment thinkers started thinking about shit like the nature of government and the economy. The latter was really important because Mercantilism was pretty much the school of thought that ruled the era. Because of mercantilism, colonies were good, and they traded with their colonies for raw goods that nobody else could have. Both sides were benefitting from this trade, mind you, even Africa was making money. So with all this thinking about politics, the stage became much more global, and the Europeans knew how to play it thanks to all these new ideas from the Enlightenment era. When people talk about how \"white people start all these horrible wars and blah blah blah blah\", what they're talking about wars that are much larger scale than the ones fought by third world countries like the world wars or the seven years war. The reason why these wars happen on such a huge scale is because Europeans are much more involved in global politics because of the enlightenment era. \n\nThird world countries exist today because they really don't want change socially and let go of old cultural traditions. For instance, in the Middle East they're still fighting age old wars over religion and cultural differences, and in Africa the people can't establish a stable governments because the people don't want to die and the people leading the civil wars are only interested in their own benefit. Some places that were just as exploited as the Middle East/Africa or arguably even more so are hugely powerful today. Despite the fact that the Brits basically turned their country into a massive drug den, China is a massive economic and military power. Japan was also \"exploited\" by Europe, but they also came out a massive military power that competed in the second world war. Its because they went out and modernized the shit out of themselves with some proper leadership.\n\nI think that today, the racial disparity in the United States and elsewhere can be blamed more on our cultures than our skin color. There are a lot of rich white people. But there are also a lot of rich indian and asian immigrants as well. Indian and asian americans make ~$26,000 and ~$12,000 dollars more, respectively, on average than \"whites\". Then, African Americans make $20,000 less on average than whites, and hispanics make ~$10,000 less. The argument is supposed to be that immigrants are put down and the evil white capitalists exploit the minorities for money.\n\nThink about this for a second. Asians come from a culture where hard work and honor is highly valued. Indians come from a culture where doing your best in society is extremely important. Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don't have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles. Black people grow up in the hood, see all the cool gangbangers selling drugs, and hearing rappers talk about money and chains. They wanna cut school, go sling dope and kill people. If they just did well in school they could easily break the chain of poverty in their family.

Because enlightenment, we play the world stage. Minorities are poor because their culture makes it so. "}, {"id": "clyvpvh", "body": "I would argue that a lack of capital and unequal opportunity for economic development, most notably \"Dutch Disease\" issues where a resource extraction and service sector boom starves industrial sectors of credit and capital, are the big factor in the disparity in world wealth. Much of the growth that has been achieved in the third world is undone by the lack of protectionist policies that might allow local industries develop to the point where average costs drop below international markets or by population growing faster than capital investment resulting in \"capital shallowing\" that makes everyone functionally poorer despite more wealth existing than previously. Still, almost two billion people in the third world went from \"global poor\" to \"global middle class\" over the past few five decades, because they got access to credit and capital at reasonable rates though expanding international markets. Just look at the kind of growth seen in Brazil and India.\n\nAfter all, economic prosperity leads to the general populace having the power and vested interest in high quality governance, which leads to better government. Better government leads to a reduction in damage done by corruption, crime, and war to economic prosperity. It's a positive feedback situation, if a prolonged economic depression happens then good governance slips in the first world, resulting in some similar problems. This is especially visible in the rise of the popular bank robber in the Great Depression and the collapse of Detroit.\n\nDoes culture have something to do with it? Possibly, but at best that effect is grossly overstated because the lack of access to public resources (such as unequal quality of public education), lack of financial services (such as the need to use a check cashing business as opposed to utilizing a free checking account from a bank/the need to use a payday lender for short term lending as opposed to a cheaper revolving line of personal credit from a bank), and the presence of more expensive poverty oriented shopping options (rent to own appliances are more than twice as expensive than mainstream stores charge, gas station and convenience store food is much more expensive than supermarkets which can be too far away for the poor to access).\n\nMercantilism rarely actually benefitted the colonies. They often restricted the income of colonies by preventing them from exporting to other nations to keep the prices low for homeland industry. There were also often legal restrictions preventing the formation of local competition to homeland industry. Basically mercantilism allowed European industry to develop to the point of maturity while preventing colonial industry from doing likewise. This meant that the colony was dependent upon European capital instead of developing local capital. It's not surprising that the former colony would struggle to develop industry from scratch while having to compete directly with already matured competition.\n\nIt's also important to realize that community investment in new business is important. If a guy has a great idea family and friends are the first people they tap to make the idea into a business. If none of them have money and none of them have connections then it becomes much, much harder to develop that business. Then there is the fact that they need to find and develop a specialized set of skills, without the connection to people who have successfully accomplished things like that before they are stuck reinventing the wheel. Gangs aren't a first choice for anyone, they are a \"fallback\" position when people seek to accomplish something and don't have the tools and resources to accomplish that thing legally in the formal sector of the economy, it's important to that poor white populations are equally prone to gang and organized crime activity given the same set of circumstances.\n\nI would argue that many of the cultural elements decried aren't a cause of anything, but a symptom of absence of essential financial and capital resources.\n\nTL;DR: White people have access to multiple generations of stored capital in their informal social networks, geographical access to capital and credit, and higher quality public resources and training. Minorities are still hindered by previous legal barriers preventing the formation of wealth that can be inherited or transferred through social networks and geographic isolation from capital and credit through institutional inertia and the expense of expanding such networks."}, {"id": "2lw7id", "body": "First, I wanna say I'm not racist.

Catherine the Great released a public manifesto in which she \"deliberately set out to stress a return to happier times\" by pursuing Enlightenment."}, {"id": "2lw7id", "body": "First, I wanna say I'm not racist. I don't think any people are different because of their appearance, nationality, or religion. I *do* however believe that like people stick together even in multicultural countries like the U.S. and our cultural differences are still there.\n\nI don't think that European people hold a lot of power in the world while third world countries exist because we oppressed or exploited them. I think it's pretty evident that Greco-Roman ideas helped jumpstart our civilization. While some people like to argue that \"throughout history whites oppress other races, from the beginning of time\" thats really not true. White people were pretty much at the same place as everybody else until Rome. Pretty much everywhere that the Romans conquered was inhabited by white people. It was Greco-Roman ideas that surfaced after the fall of the Roman empire that gave us things like empiricism and rationalism, as you all know. \n\nWhite people started to become really \"oppresivish\" during the colonial era, which a lot of people also like to talk about. Well during this time, thanks to navigation, European powers started exploring and their influence began to stretch across the ocean. Trade became more global and not limited to neighbors. Enlightenment thinkers started thinking about shit like the nature of government and the economy. The latter was really important because Mercantilism was pretty much the school of thought that ruled the era. Because of mercantilism, colonies were good, and they traded with their colonies for raw goods that nobody else could have. Both sides were benefitting from this trade, mind you, even Africa was making money. So with all this thinking about politics, the stage became much more global, and the Europeans knew how to play it thanks to all these new ideas from the Enlightenment era. When people talk about how \"white people start all these horrible wars and blah blah blah blah\", what they're talking about wars that are much larger scale than the ones fought by third world countries like the world wars or the seven years war. The reason why these wars happen on such a huge scale is because Europeans are much more involved in global politics because of the enlightenment era. \n\nThird world countries exist today because they really don't want change socially and let go of old cultural traditions. For instance, in the Middle East they're still fighting age old wars over religion and cultural differences, and in Africa the people can't establish a stable governments because the people don't want to die and the people leading the civil wars are only interested in their own benefit. Some places that were just as exploited as the Middle East/Africa or arguably even more so are hugely powerful today. Despite the fact that the Brits basically turned their country into a massive drug den, China is a massive economic and military power. Japan was also \"exploited\" by Europe, but they also came out a massive military power that competed in the second world war. Its because they went out and modernized the shit out of themselves with some proper leadership.\n\nI think that today, the racial disparity in the United States and elsewhere can be blamed more on our cultures than our skin color. There are a lot of rich white people. But there are also a lot of rich indian and asian immigrants as well. Indian and asian americans make ~$26,000 and ~$12,000 dollars more, respectively, on average than \"whites\". Then, African Americans make $20,000 less on average than whites, and hispanics make ~$10,000 less. The argument is supposed to be that immigrants are put down and the evil white capitalists exploit the minorities for money.\n\nThink about this for a second. Asians come from a culture where hard work and honor is highly valued. Indians come from a culture where doing your best in society is extremely important. Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don't have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles. Black people grow up in the hood, see all the cool gangbangers selling drugs, and hearing rappers talk about money and chains. They wanna cut school, go sling dope and kill people. If they just did well in school they could easily break the chain of poverty in their family. If their parents were telling them from the time that they are born that they need to work hard to make it and if they don't that they will be a disgrace, I bet there would be many more successful blacks.\n\nAnyway, this post got a little long, so I'll just say:\n\nTL;DR: White people experienced enlightenment. Because enlightenment, we play the world stage. Minorities are poor because their culture makes it so.

Here are two ways in which I see racism:\n\n1. When he says:\n\n&gt;African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles.\n\nAfrican American culture doesn't encourage crime. That's a ridiculous stereotype. The vast majority of African Americans don't ever commit crime. Furthermore, there's a lot of data that suggests that drug crimes are committed by whites just as much as blacks, but African Americans are disproportionately incarcerated for those crimes. Plus he ignores the mountains of research that suggest blacks don't have equal opportunities and face discrimination in terms of every avenue through which the typical person can attain upward social mobility.\n\n2. His argument basically says that \"Whites/Asians work harder then Latinos and Blacks because of cultural differences, not structural factors.\" Ignoring the institutional racism that's embedded every aspect of our society is a form of racism. What he doesn't realize is that structure and culture have an interactive relationship. Cultures adapt due to structural factors (like segregation). To the degree to which urban blacks do reject middle class norms and values (oppositional culture), this is a reaction to segregation and inequalities. It's self-defeating and it perpetuates the very inequalities that cause it."}, {"id": "clyracb", "body": "First, I wanna say that the viewpoint you just expressed above is absolutely racist.

First, it presumes that persons of color are too stupid to already know what it is they\u2019re experiencing. Those who bemoan the so-called victim mindset appear to believe that no one would think about racism were it not for the constant presence of liberals and leftists raising the issue. Secondly, the argument supposes that black and brown folks are so weak-willed that if they really understood the obstacles in their way, they would crumble like pie crust...\nThe truth is, folks of color (especially African Americans) are well aware of the negative stereotypes held about their racial group by an early age. Indeed, recent evidence indicates an awareness of these stereotypes by as soon as the third grade, and rarely later than the fifth: around the age of, say, eleven. This awareness\u2013which is not due to liberals bringing it up, but rather, the result of black and brown folks living with the mistreatment that stems from the stereotypes and being exposed to them in media and elsewhere\u2013has been found to dramatically impact academic performance. Even (and especially) among highly capable and motivated students of color, the fear of living down to a stereotype has been shown to generate such anxiety that it can suppress performance, relative to ability, thereby perpetuating the very performance gaps that feed the stereotypes about black intelligence in the first place. In other words, whether or not white racism is discussed, the knowledge of its existence is sufficient to negatively impact black and brown success. Talking about racism isn\u2019t the problem: racism itself is.\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s stunning that anyone would deny this basic truth, especially given the historic evidence at our disposal to prove its veracity. After all, if you ask most any black person over the age of forty what their parents told them about race when they were younger, you will hear one or another version of the following in reply: that they would have to work twice as hard as white folks. And this they were told, not as some free-floating, de-contextualized notion, but precisely because the system was so profoundly unjust and discrimination so deeply ingrained, that despite their best efforts and talent, they would too often be overlooked for the best jobs and opportunities solely because of the color of their skin.\"\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "clyt0gz", "body": "the quote was to convey a general idea that i present overall rather than to be taken literally sorry it flew over your head.

It is difficult, but why do we see so few people trying? They would rather just sit back and collect welfare and deal drugs and talk about the \"struggle\" than actually build something of their lives for their children and their children's children\"\n\n\nyea this is a racist view. for this i will quote [one of my fav pieces on the myth of the victim mentality.](http://www.timwise.org/2010/02/racism-and-the-myth-of-a-victim-mentality/)\n\n\"The possibility that persons of color might adopt a victim mentality once they learn the extent of racism, means we simply have to move on, and tell those who are, as a matter of fact, often the victims of injustice not to dwell on their experiences too much, lest their commitment to self-help be vitiated.\n\nThat such an argument as this is fundamentally racist should be obvious. First, it presumes that persons of color are too stupid to already know what it is they\u2019re experiencing. Those who bemoan the so-called victim mindset appear to believe that no one would think about racism were it not for the constant presence of liberals and leftists raising the issue. Secondly, the argument supposes that black and brown folks are so weak-willed that if they really understood the obstacles in their way, they would crumble like pie crust...\nThe truth is, folks of color (especially African Americans) are well aware of the negative stereotypes held about their racial group by an early age. Indeed, recent evidence indicates an awareness of these stereotypes by as soon as the third grade, and rarely later than the fifth: around the age of, say, eleven. This awareness\u2013which is not due to liberals bringing it up, but rather, the result of black and brown folks living with the mistreatment that stems from the stereotypes and being exposed to them in media and elsewhere\u2013has been found to dramatically impact academic performance. Even (and especially) among highly capable and motivated students of color, the fear of living down to a stereotype has been shown to generate such anxiety that it can suppress performance, relative to ability, thereby perpetuating the very performance gaps that feed the stereotypes about black intelligence in the first place. In other words, whether or not white racism is discussed, the knowledge of its existence is sufficient to negatively impact black and brown success. Talking about racism isn\u2019t the problem: racism itself is.\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s stunning that anyone would deny this basic truth, especially given the historic evidence at our disposal to prove its veracity. After all, if you ask most any black person over the age of forty what their parents told them about race when they were younger, you will hear one or another version of the following in reply: that they would have to work twice as hard as white folks. And this they were told, not as some free-floating, de-contextualized notion, but precisely because the system was so profoundly unjust and discrimination so deeply ingrained, that despite their best efforts and talent, they would too often be overlooked for the best jobs and opportunities solely because of the color of their skin.\"\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "clyvw0j", "body": "\n\n&gt;Frankly, it\u2019s stunning that anyone would deny this basic truth, especially given the historic evidence at our disposal to prove its veracity.

Sociology is so poorly understood by so many people that I don't think it's all just willful ignorance. Rather, in the absence of any formal education about the nuances of modern race relations, people with little experience turn towards the simplest and incorrect explanation: that black people are just lazy, their culture is bad, etc. It's the easiest thing to blame when you can't see everything else that's going on.

I think it's pretty evident that Greco-Roman ideas helped jumpstart our civilization. While some people like to argue that \"throughout history whites oppress other races, from the beginning of time\" thats really not true. White people were pretty much at the same place as everybody else until Rome. Pretty much everywhere that the Romans conquered was inhabited by white people. It was Greco-Roman ideas that surfaced after the fall of the Roman empire that gave us things like empiricism and rationalism, as you all know. \n\nWhite people started to become really \"oppresivish\" during the colonial era, which a lot of people also like to talk about. Well during this time, thanks to navigation, European powers started exploring and their influence began to stretch across the ocean. Trade became more global and not limited to neighbors. Enlightenment thinkers started thinking about shit like the nature of government and the economy. The latter was really important because Mercantilism was pretty much the school of thought that ruled the era. Because of mercantilism, colonies were good, and they traded with their colonies for raw goods that nobody else could have. Both sides were benefitting from this trade, mind you, even Africa was making money. So with all this thinking about politics, the stage became much more global, and the Europeans knew how to play it thanks to all these new ideas from the Enlightenment era. When people talk about how \"white people start all these horrible wars and blah blah blah blah\", what they're talking about wars that are much larger scale than the ones fought by third world countries like the world wars or the seven years war. The reason why these wars happen on such a huge scale is because Europeans are much more involved in global politics because of the enlightenment era. \n\nThird world countries exist today because they really don't want change socially and let go of old cultural traditions. For instance, in the Middle East they're still fighting age old wars over religion and cultural differences, and in Africa the people can't establish a stable governments because the people don't want to die and the people leading the civil wars are only interested in their own benefit. Some places that were just as exploited as the Middle East/Africa or arguably even more so are hugely powerful today. Despite the fact that the Brits basically turned their country into a massive drug den, China is a massive economic and military power. Japan was also \"exploited\" by Europe, but they also came out a massive military power that competed in the second world war. Its because they went out and modernized the shit out of themselves with some proper leadership.\n\nI think that today, the racial disparity in the United States and elsewhere can be blamed more on our cultures than our skin color. There are a lot of rich white people. But there are also a lot of rich indian and asian immigrants as well. Indian and asian americans make ~$26,000 and ~$12,000 dollars more, respectively, on average than \"whites\". Then, African Americans make $20,000 less on average than whites, and hispanics make ~$10,000 less. The argument is supposed to be that immigrants are put down and the evil white capitalists exploit the minorities for money.\n\nThink about this for a second. Asians come from a culture where hard work and honor is highly valued. Indians come from a culture where doing your best in society is extremely important. Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don't have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles. Black people grow up in the hood, see all the cool gangbangers selling drugs, and hearing rappers talk about money and chains. They wanna cut school, go sling dope and kill people. If they just did well in school they could easily break the chain of poverty in their family. If their parents were telling them from the time that they are born that they need to work hard to make it and if they don't that they will be a disgrace, I bet there would be many more successful blacks.\n\nAnyway, this post got a little long, so I'll just say:\n\nTL;DR: White people experienced enlightenment. Because enlightenment, we play the world stage. Minorities are poor because their culture makes it so. "}, {"id": "clyy6p1", "body": "First: these are two completely separate issues(the third world and post-industrial economies).\n\nRegarding the disparities between first and third world countries. A lot of that can still be traced back to the transition from Hunter/gatherer societies into horticultural ones. Eurasia's climate provided bountiful harvests significantly quicker than the other continents, allowing them to transition into agricultural societies. Eurasia also had the luxury of animals capable of domestication. \n\nThose two major factors resulted in Eurasia having a significant developmental advantage over the other regions by allowing higher yields for less work, resulting in specialized labor advancing their technological capabilities.\n\nIt also resulted in smallpox/flus  ravaging European population centers although this ended up being an advantage because they developed resistance to the diseases. \n\nThus, when Europeans ventured outside of Eurasia, they encountered groups who had not progressed as far technologically and established colonies. \n\nThis did help to bridge the technology gap, however the whites had suppressed the natives every step of the way. Slavery, oppression, lack of education, indentured servitude and so on. Then, by the time the colonies pulled out the natives had such mistrust in their oppressors, the transitions were rarely peaceful. This resulted in destroyed infrastructure and a power gap with no one to maintain their economies/infrastructure. \n\nThen different groups struggle for power, a government gets formed but because they have so little to work with/not enough education to make progress. Then another war breaks out and the cycle repeats. \n\nThe countries who get out of this cycle easily usually had a peaceful transition or large populations that let them move straight into an industrial economy(India, China). For the others though, with how spread out their population is, the transition away from agricultural economies isn't as smooth. \n\n\n\nAs far as the culture clashes in the US (especially the contrast between blacks and whites) is more socioeconomic than anything. As a whole, it hasn't even been 100 years since open racism(White only establishments) has been removed from our society. As such, there are still people alive who lived through Jim Crowe laws, never graduated high school,  etc. \n\nIt is also important to realize that property taxes are one of the major funders of schools in America. \n\nAs America transitioned away from segregation, whites started to move outside of urban centers and into suburbs as the cities became more mixed (this wasn't entirely a racist response, although it certainly affected it and is called the \"White Flight\") and crowded. A great example would be Gary, Indiana. \n\n With cities losing much of their established customer base to suburbs, businesses relocated or closed. Property values then declined, resulting in more poorer minorities moving in.\n\nSince the schools get funded from property taxes, these inner city schools suffer. With parents who are uneducated/distrusting of the schools/too busy working to support their kiss education like the middle class can. \n\nAsians do not suffer from this because many of the ones who come to the US do so for a better life. There are Indians and Asians who are not extremely studious/hard working, however they do not typically leave their home country without a reason to do so. \n\n\nTl;dr - 3rd world countries are the result of bad luck and colonialism hindering a \"natural\" progression. \n\nRacial inequality is the lingering result of slavery and poor schools.

Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don't have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles.

As a whole, it hasn't even been 100 years since open racism(White only establishments) has been removed from our society. As such, there are still people alive who lived through Jim Crowe laws, never graduated high school,  etc. \n\nIt is also important to realize that property taxes are one of the major funders of schools in America. \n\nAs America transitioned away from segregation, whites started to move outside of urban centers and into suburbs as the cities became more mixed (this wasn't entirely a racist response, although it certainly affected it and is called the \"White Flight\") and crowded. A great example would be Gary, Indiana. \n\n With cities losing much of their established customer base to suburbs, businesses relocated or closed. Property values then declined, resulting in more poorer minorities moving in.\n\nSince the schools get funded from property taxes, these inner city schools suffer.

Its thanks to Baghdad (Which was the center of the civilized world for almost twice as long as London held the title), that the works of little philosophers such as Plato were kept alive. Without them the enlightenment would not have taken place. \n\nThe Far East had governed lands for as long as Egypt did, and their technical advances gave birth to the underpinnings of the industrial revolution.

We were a backwater with a curious amount of railroads being built.

Well during this time, thanks to navigation, European powers started exploring and their influence began to stretch across the ocean. Trade became more global and not limited to neighbors. Enlightenment thinkers started thinking about shit like the nature of government and the economy. The latter was really important because Mercantilism was pretty much the school of thought that ruled the era. Because of mercantilism, colonies were good, and they traded with their colonies for raw goods that nobody else could have. Both sides were benefitting from this trade, mind you, even Africa was making money. So with all this thinking about politics, the stage became much more global, and the Europeans knew how to play it thanks to all these new ideas from the Enlightenment era. When people talk about how \"white people start all these horrible wars and blah blah blah blah\", what they're talking about wars that are much larger scale than the ones fought by third world countries like the world wars or the seven years war. The reason why these wars happen on such a huge scale is because Europeans are much more involved in global politics because of the enlightenment era. \n\nThird world countries exist today because they really don't want change socially and let go of old cultural traditions. For instance, in the Middle East they're still fighting age old wars over religion and cultural differences, and in Africa the people can't establish a stable governments because the people don't want to die and the people leading the civil wars are only interested in their own benefit. Some places that were just as exploited as the Middle East/Africa or arguably even more so are hugely powerful today. Despite the fact that the Brits basically turned their country into a massive drug den, China is a massive economic and military power. Japan was also \"exploited\" by Europe, but they also came out a massive military power that competed in the second world war. Its because they went out and modernized the shit out of themselves with some proper leadership.\n\nI think that today, the racial disparity in the United States and elsewhere can be blamed more on our cultures than our skin color. There are a lot of rich white people. But there are also a lot of rich indian and asian immigrants as well. Indian and asian americans make ~$26,000 and ~$12,000 dollars more, respectively, on average than \"whites\". Then, African Americans make $20,000 less on average than whites, and hispanics make ~$10,000 less. The argument is supposed to be that immigrants are put down and the evil white capitalists exploit the minorities for money.\n\nThink about this for a second. Asians come from a culture where hard work and honor is highly valued. Indians come from a culture where doing your best in society is extremely important. Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don't have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don't have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles. Black people grow up in the hood, see all the cool gangbangers selling drugs, and hearing rappers talk about money and chains. They wanna cut school, go sling dope and kill people. If they just did well in school they could easily break the chain of poverty in their family. If their parents were telling them from the time that they are born that they need to work hard to make it and if they don't that they will be a disgrace, I bet there would be many more successful blacks.\n\nAnyway, this post got a little long, so I'll just say:\n\nTL;DR: White people experienced enlightenment.

Because enlightenment, we play the world stage. Minorities are poor because their culture makes it so. "}, {"id": "clyy75c", "body": "First: these are two completely separate issues(the third world and post-industrial economies).\n\nRegarding the disparities between first and third world countries. A lot of that can still be traced back to the transition from Hunter/gatherer societies into horticultural ones. Eurasia's climate provided bountiful harvests significantly quicker than the other continents, allowing them to transition into agricultural societies. Eurasia also had the luxury of animals capable of domestication. \n\nThose two major factors resulted in Eurasia having a significant developmental advantage over the other regions by allowing higher yields for less work, resulting in specialized labor advancing their technological capabilities.\n\nIt also resulted in smallpox/flus  ravaging European population centers although this ended up being an advantage because they developed resistance to the diseases. \n\nThus, when Europeans ventured outside of Eurasia, they encountered groups who had not progressed as far technologically and established colonies. \n\nThis did help to bridge the technology gap, however the whites had suppressed the natives every step of the way. Slavery, oppression, lack of education, indentured servitude and so on. Then, by the time the colonies pulled out the natives had such mistrust in their oppressors, the transitions were rarely peaceful. This resulted in destroyed infrastructure and a power gap with no one to maintain their economies/infrastructure. \n\nThen different groups struggle for power, a government gets formed but because they have so little to work with/not enough education to make progress. Then another war breaks out and the cycle repeats. \n\nThe countries who get out of this cycle easily usually had a peaceful transition or large populations that let them move straight into an industrial economy(India, China). For the others though, with how spread out their population is, the transition away from agricultural economies isn't as smooth. \n\n\n\nAs far as the culture clashes in the US (especially the contrast between blacks and whites) is more socioeconomic than anything. As a whole, it hasn't even been 100 years since open racism(White only establishments) has been removed from our society. As such, there are still people alive who lived through Jim Crowe laws, never graduated high school,  etc. \n\nIt is also important to realize that property taxes are one of the major funders of schools in America. \n\nAs America transitioned away from segregation, whites started to move outside of urban centers and into suburbs as the cities became more mixed (this wasn't entirely a racist response, although it certainly affected it and is called the \"White Flight\") and crowded. A great example would be Gary, Indiana. \n\n With cities losing much of their established customer base to suburbs, businesses relocated or closed. Property values then declined, resulting in more poorer minorities moving in.\n\nSince the schools get funded from property taxes, these inner city schools suffer. With parents who are uneducated/distrusting of the schools/too busy working to support their kiss education like the middle class can. \n\nAsians do not suffer from this because many of the ones who come to the US do so for a better life. There are Indians and Asians who are not extremely studious/hard working, however they do not typically leave their home country without a reason to do so. \n\n\nTl;dr - 3rd world countries are the result of bad luck and colonialism hindering a \"natural\" progression. \n\nRacial inequality is the lingering result of slavery and poor schools. Comparing blacks to immigrants is inaccurate because we get the \"best\" immigrants.

The muscle loss cannot simply be countered by working out extra hard.  Testosterone is a vital hormone for building and maintaining muscle mass.  Most transgender women end up with even less testosterone than ciswomen due to the removal of their androgen producing gonads.  Their natural steroids are basically gone.  And since estrogen promotes fat storage, transwomen are more likely to have a worse muscle to fat ratio for their weight class than ciswomen.\n\nSo, what is this \"physical build of a man\" that carries over through a process of gender transition and hormone therapy?
