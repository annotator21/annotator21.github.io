It is not priceless, nor is it worthless. It is simply something that is and isn't. \n\n*What is the worth of a human?* -At one time, the human species had value just as much as the other life forms on earth. Over the next couple thousand years, we have done horrible damage to our one reliable resource. I cannot in good conscience value human life.\n\n*What is the worth of society?* -Society is like the fly population. It serves a very vital purpose in how what we know is structured, but can it please just take a day off or something? The most ignorant and horrible things ever done in the history of mankind were done because a group of people with certain beliefs agreed on something (ie: the KKK, holocaust, 9/11). Society is a petri dish where humans can grow in a biased environment. Society is also something that cannot be valued, but for different reasons. The urge to be around others of your own kind exists everywhere, and this cannot be blamed for the barbaric acts that arise from humans following the instinct.\n\n*Why do people have power that isn't physical?* -Society is the answer to this. Having 100 people on your side would usually make the other 10 fall right into line. There are outliers as shown all across history, but the pattern exists for a reason.\n\n*Why has the world degenerated so much?* -Because of humans. We all(arguable) want to improve the standard of living of ourselves and those we look favorable toward, also known as our \"loved ones\".\n\n*How does all of this tie together?* -People look after their own due to the attachments they develop. This would cause you to rush to the defense of those you form attachments to. In this way, we have those who \"serve and protect\" because of their abstract attachment such as loyalty to a country, society, or government system. Morals are just people agreeing that certain things are right and certain things are wrong. If you do not conform to such a view, you are bombarded with disapproval and peer pressure until you approve, are somewhere you cannot impact society from, or are dead. Humans are flawed so our morals and values must also be flawed on some level.\n\n*Where is the danger?* -Mommy only knows best when you're mommy. Otherwise, she is just trying to impose her ideas and worldview on you. This attitude is the biggest cause of conflicts throughout human history. We just can't *trust* one another! And for good reason, too. Humans just cannot be trusted, especially by other humans. So what's the next best thing? Conformity. Peer pressure. Social norms. Playing to your instincts. You will defend what you want while the other team will defend what they want and both of you will look like idiots afterwards because you will finally see that your motivations are one and the same. *You* are the same as *them*. There is no us and them because we are all exactly the same. Does that perspective make every single altercation in the history of mankind look completely and utterly moronic to anyone else? Forget sacrifice. Forget selflessness. Forget duty. Forget necessity. Forget greed. Forget quarrel. Forget *love*! Every single altercation between two humans, no matter what it was over, looks so laughably primitive to me that I find myself wishing that I had never been concieved.\n\nChange my view, Reddit.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We *ought* to make every attempt to preserve biodiversity. We *ought* to recognize the beauty of other life forms. But make no mistake, there is no part of nature that obligates us to do this.

We may not show it now, and we may end up finding it too late. But the important thing to recognize is that we are the only hope for the preservation of our current level of biodiversity. If humans face a clear existential threat to the planet, it will be our interest to save it. If we have to/can move off planet, no doubt we will preserve some species that would otherwise be unpreserved. But in the end, why do you have such an intense fixation on our current biodiversity? Do you weep for the 99.99% of all species that have gone extinct? Or the quadrillions of organisms in the following eons that will perish as well? \n\nThis is nature.

And if your current life is so bad that it seems like a net negative and you believe there to be a high probability of this continuing to be true into the future *and* you deem any negative impact your death at this time would have to others as not important then there is nothing *logical* (as opposed to instincts, emotions and rationalizations) that stops you from pursuing suicide.

Most models make that subjective assessment on the actions that they are judging.  However, Consequentialism makes that subjective assessment on the end goal rather than the actions themselves.

I like this because I find it much easier to construct an ideal model of the goal to try to shape the world after, and then judge the actions I take based on what they do to achieve this goal.\n\nIn the particular case of hunting, my ultimate goal is to maintain a stable ecosystem for as long as possible.  My reasons for this are two fold.  My primary reason can be best sumed up by a quote from Theodore Roosevelt: \n\n&gt;\"Defenders of the short-sighted men who in their greed and selfishness will, if permitted, rob our country of half its charm by their reckless extermination of all useful and beautiful wild things sometimes seek to champion them by saying the \u201cthe game belongs to the people.\u201d So it does; and not merely to the people now alive, but to the unborn people. The \u201cgreatest good for the greatest number\u201d applies to the number within the womb of time, compared to which those now alive form but an insignificant fraction. Our duty to the whole, including the unborn generations, bids us restrain an unprincipled present-day minority from wasting the heritage of these unborn generations. The movement for the conservation of wild life and the larger movement for the conservation of all our natural resources are essentially democratic in spirit, purpose, and method.\"\n\nIn short, this refers to the responsibility to future generations to ensure that the natural resources available to us today, remain available.  This does not just apply to the physical use of resources, but also the aesthetic use of resources.\n\nMy other reason is a bit more complicated.  It can be best summed up as the fact that I find the value of an ecosystem or our biosphere to be greater than the sum of its parts.  As such, I am willing to sacrifice parts of these systems to ensure the well being of the whole.\n\nThe end result, is that because hunting can be used for the benefit of the ecosystem as a whole, it is justified."}, {"id": "cmb64d2", "body": "I have no problem with hunting, but interestingly enough, I think I might have an easier time convincing you that it's *never* ethical. \n\nEthics are not conditional, I don't believe.

For example, [wolves eat their prey while they are still alive](http://listverse.com/2012/04/14/top-10-little-known-facts-about-wolves/) (fact #1).  So do lions, hyenas and other predators.  Constrictors slowly squeeze the air out of their prey over the course of many minutes.  Venomous snakes can take up to an hour for their prey to die from the venom.\n\nHunting is one of the cleanest and most ethical ways of killing.  Most of the time the hunter will get a clean kill and the animal will die almost instantly.  A good shot with a rifle will kill a deer almost instantly.  It will either pierce the spine with a high shot or the heart &amp; lungs with a lower shot (depending on which you aim for).  This is a far easier death than almost any other death the animal could get.\n\nFurther, hunters have contributed more to wildlife and wilderness preservation than almost any other group.  [Here](http://blog.gaiam.com/as-hunter-numbers-decline-how-will-we-fund-wildlife-conservation/) is an article on the subject.\n\n&gt;In my own state of Wisconsin, deer-hunting licenses and permits generated $22.7 million in revenue for the department of natural resources in 2010. And in most years, an excise tax on hunting equipment provides an additional $10 million to the state for wildlife management\n\nThat is over $30 million every year in one state.  Including other hunting licenses, that could easily top $40 million per year that is all going to fund conservation.\n\n[Here](http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/2014/10/the-role-of-hunting-in-modern-conservation-biology/) is an article and presentation from Berkeley's Environmental website (extremely left wing) that agrees.\n\nHikers don't do this.

For example, [wolves eat their prey while they are still alive](http://listverse.com/2012/04/14/top-10-little-known-facts-about-wolves/) (fact #1).  So do lions, hyenas and other predators.  Constrictors slowly squeeze the air out of their prey over the course of many minutes.  Venomous snakes can take up to an hour for their prey to die from the venom.\n\nHunting is one of the cleanest and most ethical ways of killing.  Most of the time the hunter will get a clean kill and the animal will die almost instantly.  A good shot with a rifle will kill a deer almost instantly.  It will either pierce the spine with a high shot or the heart &amp; lungs with a lower shot (depending on which you aim for).  This is a far easier death than almost any other death the animal could get.\n\nFurther, hunters have contributed more to wildlife and wilderness preservation than almost any other group.  [Here](http://blog.gaiam.com/as-hunter-numbers-decline-how-will-we-fund-wildlife-conservation/) is an article on the subject.\n\n&gt;In my own state of Wisconsin, deer-hunting licenses and permits generated $22.7 million in revenue for the department of natural resources in 2010. And in most years, an excise tax on hunting equipment provides an additional $10 million to the state for wildlife management\n\nThat is over $30 million every year in one state.  Including other hunting licenses, that could easily top $40 million per year that is all going to fund conservation.\n\n[Here](http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/2014/10/the-role-of-hunting-in-modern-conservation-biology/) is an article and presentation from Berkeley's Environmental website (extremely left wing) that agrees.\n\nHikers don't do this.

Yes, hunters do get some enjoyment out of it, but I hardly think that their happiness outweighs the pain of a gunshot wound. I do however place the life and wellbeing of humans over animals, which is why if it is ever necessary, humans can ethically kill and eat animals. Hunting should not be done as a means to merely increase food supplies either because it is very possible to live a healthy life without the consumption of meat.\n\nMy view boils down to that it is only ethical to kill out of necessity, so if anyone could elaborate on some reasons why it would be ethical to kill without needing to I would genuinely like to hear them.\n\nLastly, I don't only want reasons why hunting without necessity is ethical, but also reasons why hunting is never ethical.\n\nEdit: My view has been changed when invasive and over all harmful species are taken into account, but there's still room to change my view about non-invasive, non-harmful species.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But I don't think you understand how that would happen. The process is, I consider, unethical and has terrible consequences. For example wolf populations have been all but decimated. In many places, deer don't have enough predators. This leads to overpopulation. That in turn leads to their mass starvation, damage to the environment(the plants they eat being over-consumed) and their encroachment on humans. \n\nThat last part doesn't sound so bad at first. But you have to remember that would lead to an increase of deer being hit by cars. That kills or maims the deer and is likely to kill those in the car as well. Large animals loose in human society is very dangerous, even if they are generally passive animals.\n\nNow take those factors and apply them to a more dangerous animal, such as boar. They can grow to be huge and are extremely aggressive. They can kill or main people and other animals. They are actually one of the more dangerous animals to hunt.\n\nUnregulated hunting is bad. That's what lead to the decline of wolves, for example. But human society has advanced to the point that any hands off approach to conservationism will only lead to more damage to the environment and more loss of animal life. We've put ourselves a difficult position due to our society's size and our past actions that damaged the ecosystem.

Even if the parks can be effectively closed off, there is still the issue of maintaining a proper ecological balance within the park.\n\n**Edit:**  I forgot to note that physical barriers only affect some species.  All birds in the US are capable of flight, and so they would just fly over any barrier.  Then there are also several fossorial species that could just burrow under barriers.  For these species, no amount of barriers can affect them.\n\n&gt;In non-urban areas, perhaps the reintroduction and protection of predators, along with contraceptive methods, might keep the deer population to manageable levels.\n\nThere are some areas where predators are being reintroduced, but predators typically have very fragile populations and a slow recovery.  Even when they are brought back to the necessary levels, they are indiscriminate about what they hunt.  They will go where they can get food, and that isn't always the same as the populations that need to be controlled.

In fact, nonlethal hunts would likely be more effective than lethal ones as they wouldn't face the same restrictions.\n\nContraceptives need to be delivered in precise doses and on a precise schedule.  How do you make sure you have the right dose for the deer you are shooting?  How do you know if it has already received its dose or not?  How do you make sure you got enough of the deer to make an impact?  Shooting up the same deer 11 times isn't the same as shooting up 11 deer.  With a lethal hunt, you know there is no chance of a single deer being crossed off twice.\n\nJust so you know, contraceptives is one of the things that has been proposed, but no one has been able to figure out a way that we can actually deliver them effectively.\n\n&gt;In urban environments, I don't see any reason why deer populations could not be controlled by physical barriers, repellents, and altering the environment itself to be less suitable to deer.\n\nUrban environments typically don't have that much of a problem, the issue becomes bigger in suburban environments.  For some areas, physical barriers work, and they are already in place where they are effective.  However, there are some parks in suburban areas that are simply too large to effectively close off, especially in the cases where there are paths crossing the parks that people enjoy going on walks through.  Even if the parks can be effectively closed off, there is still the issue of maintaining a proper ecological balance within the park.\n\n**Edit:**  I forgot to note that physical barriers only affect some species.  All birds in the US are capable of flight, and so they would just fly over any barrier.  Then there are also several fossorial species that could just burrow under barriers.  For these species, no amount of barriers can affect them.\n\n&gt;In non-urban areas, perhaps the reintroduction and protection of predators, along with contraceptive methods, might keep the deer population to manageable levels.\n\nThere are some areas where predators are being reintroduced, but predators typically have very fragile populations and a slow recovery.  Even when they are brought back to the necessary levels, they are indiscriminate about what they hunt.  They will go where they can get food, and that isn't always the same as the populations that need to be controlled.

It might be easy for you to go to the supermarket and grab a can of chickpeas and soy proteins, but in most countries, these sorts of luxuries don't exist. Meat can quite often be more affordable in terms of cost to protein when alternatives are available, and when alternatives aren't available, meat is literally the only option for protein nine times out of ten.\n\nAlso, your CMV brings up questions about the definitions of \"ethical\" and \"necessity\". In regards to necessity, what are we defining as necessary conditions for it to be 'ethical' to kill animals? For human sustenance? For animal control and environmental preservation? Farming and agriculture? Small-scale non-industrial farming may kill animals, but it is generally more environmentally friendly and more protein efficient than a similar small-scale non-industrial soy farm. Do the ethics of animal rights outweigh the ethics of environmental damage?\n\nIn regards to \"ethics\", we need to make comparisons between what ethical and moral issues exist now, and what issues would exist in a world where no one eats meat or kills animals out of necessity.

If something is off-topic or inflammatory enough to be removed, moderation should step in to handle it. \n\n\"Downvotes=Disagreement\" is against most of reddit's policies and most subreddit policies as well, and is also not as useful (\"I don't want people to see this\") than an upvote (\"I want more people to see this\").  Upvote what you want people to see, and ignore what you don't want people to see. \n\n\nI'd also like to make a special note for the AMA subreddits, where unpopular people doing an AMA can be downvoted and have their comments annoyingly hidden.  The downsides of downvoting are especially prevalent in these situations.\n\nIt also hampers individuality and creative thought by introducing a disincentive to voice an unpopular or non-mainstream idea or stance.\n\n\nIt may sound like a minor thing, but I think the change to remove the downvote would be beneficial.\n\n\nEDIT:  An idea was proposed to use RES to avoid negative-comment collapse, and I like that idea.

In practice they take a thread off topic. The ability to downvote excites the contrary beast of Reddit's \"What's wrong with this picture?\" outlook.

Which George Lucas was the head of and while he did not direct 2/3 of the original trilogy he was still running the company that produced them and acted **a writer and executive producer** on both films (not necessarily writing the screenplay but the story). This put Lucas in a unique creative position as the head of the production company, a writer of the story and executive producer of the film.

For example, even though Alfred Hitchcock didn't always work with the same producers, screenwriters, or actors, we can find similarities in a Hitchcock film because his creative influence was so strong. He picked his stories, came up with ideas, hired personnel, cast actors, etc. The auteur theory states that we should view Hitchcock as the \"author\" of his movies in the way that Hemingway is the author of his novels. \n\nNot all directors are auteurs, and not all auteurs are directors. Lucas is actually a really great example of auteur theory because even though he didn't even direct OR write Empire Strikes Back, his *influence* still remains in the story, concepts, and images. \n\nThe problem a lot of people have with the auteur theory is the exact problem you're having which is that, at the end of the day, yes, maybe there is one person who has the most creative input, but there are few films in which *only one person* has ALL the creative input, and placing importance on one person as the \"author\" takes away from all of the people working on the movie. Your view isn't just about STAR WARS, therefore, but pretty much all movies, ever.\n\nIf you actually read up on the auteur theory, though, you'll find that the core idea is not **many influential filmmakers are the single creative source of a film** and more **if we HAD to point to a single \"author\" in order to make film conveniently analogous with novels and paintings that traditionally are the work of a single artist, that artist WOULD HAVE TO BE the director or producer that has the most creative control.** Therefore, working under auteur theory, we HAVE to point to Lucas, even if we acknowledge we are working under a flawed way of thinking. The theory is a flawed way of thinking about movies the way we think about other art forms.

I'm sure it's possible, but it's not usually practical or how we live our life.  You can keep separate bank accounts easily enough, but what happens if you separate and you now have to divide all of the tangible property you've accumulated?  Are you going to put a sticker on everything each of you has bought while in the relationship?\n\nWhat about home-owning?  If you foresee yourself buying a house, you're going to run into issues regarding mortgage payments and liabilities as well as who owns (and would likely get) the house for dissolution purposes.\n\nWhen we starting living out our life with someone, we naturally commingle assets.  That's exactly how we do things with our partners, married or not.  Relationships implicitly carry out the risk of dissolution, but marriage comes with more defined markers on who belongs to whom and where it will consequently go if the relationship doesn't last.  They're flexible contours because we're usually concerned about fairness and equity, but they're still nonetheless defined and give some predictability and management to the couple.\n\nIf someone dies, there's no guarantee either of you will be able to give away your stuff to the other partner.  Good, thorough drafting of wills and other estate planning documents should help with this, but my experience has shown that (1) people very rarely want to deal with this particular hurdle because no one likes to talk about or anticipates their own death, and; (2) with non-traditional couples in particular, it requires way more vigilance on updating the documents because the law is presently in flux.  That's annoying, costly, and not something most people are likely to devote themselves to.  Real life takes precedence and this is usually in the back of our minds even if we know it's important.\n\nThen there is the sadder topic of your partner getting hurt.  We've had problems in the US with hospitals denying gay people access to their partners in the hospital even with rigorous documentation that should have, by all means, let them through.  Even if you're \"technically\" able to visit, it's so much harder to tell a married person they can't see their spouse than to tell a person with ten pages of paper that they're super close and s/he needs to see them.  Mix in disapproving families and you're just adding more to your grief, since next-of-kin is a status that likewise carries heavy legal weight and can beat out 'special friend' status, rather than married partner status.\n\nFinally, marriage creates benefits with respect to parental rights.  I don't know what the rules are in the UK but being married and having kids typically creates very strong presumptions for those married people.  This is particularly important for gay couples since they are marginalized not just on the marital front, but on the child-rearing front.  A marriage license effectively announces a number of rights and privileges (and responsibilities) to the world, making them harder to take away."}, {"id": "2n6ttn", "body": "So I am a 24 year old gay guy and I have been criticized by some gay guys for having no real interest in same sex marriage and admitting that its something that isn't going to affect my life in the slightest. \n\nI just see marriage (even the secular form) as a religious idea and it only still exists as a result of religion.

Here are a few:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Receiving Social Security, Medicare, and disability benefits for deceased spouses.\n&gt; 2. Insurance benefits through employers.\n&gt; 3. Wages and workers' comp benefits for a deceased spouse.\n&gt; 4. Family medical leave.\n&gt; 5. Bereavement leave.\n&gt; 6. Hospital visitation rights outside of normal visiting hours.\n&gt; 7. Making medical decisions for your spouse in the event of an emergency.\n&gt; 8. Consenting to postmortem examinations and procedures and other death arrangements.\n&gt; 9. Inheritance/trusts.\n&gt; 10. Suing for wrongful death of your spouse.\n&gt; 11. Marital communications privilege for evidentiary purposes in a court proceeding.\n&gt; 12. Protections granted to you if your partner is being stalked.\n&gt; 13. Renewal of leases or housing agreements (retaining previous terms, when applicable) in the event of the death of the lease signatory.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are just a few. Some can be addressed legally with contracts, others not so much. You would need to spend some money on legal assistance to cover as many rights as possible, which would be the same situation as a pre-nup. There's a fuller list [here](http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf), but it will contain stuff pertaining to issues like military benefits and residency and other issues that may or may not apply to your particular situation.\n\nAnyway, to that what I'd say is that the point of having same sex marriage is so that couples who *do want these* are not prevented from getting access to such benefits for themselves. This is very much not a purely religious idea - rather, when two people wish to share their lives with each other, marrying makes it easier for them to look out for each other. It's basically a status marker - 'I care about this person and in the event that anything happens to me, I want it clear that I would want them looked after'. It simply is unfair to deny that to consenting adults just because they're the same gender. People falling in love and wanting to look out for each other isn't a religious idea.\n\nNow the trappings of marriage and the concepts of what it should be might stem from religion, but the reality of it is something else, and if you are getting married to someone, it doesn't have to be based on symbols but rather on where you both plan on going with your lives. Do you have to *want* to get married? Maybe never, in a religious sense, but I'm not sure about whether you would want to rule it out forever. \n\nThat said, I don't see how supporting gay rights in one area takes attention away from another. It's not an either or sort of thing. Allowing gay marriage or campaigning for that comes hand in hand with increasing the visibility and profile of LGBT people in relationships and getting people to see them as not something to be marginalized, feared, or mocked. It can in fact be a good way to combat homophobic abuse - by demonstrating that all individuals should have these rights regardless of their sexual orientation or the gender of their partners, any government or group that supports gay marriage is making a statement against discrimination. \n\nIn any case, you still totally don't have to personally want to get married - that's completely fine and your own decision. However having an interest in supporting people who *do* should be. Going 'well I don't want to and no one would like me, so I don't give a shit about other people like me who might' is being pretty wilfully blind to the reality of the kind of benefits that marriage confers on people and what advantages it might give as well as how important it can be to them. People should have the personal freedom to want or not want things. Not wanting marriage doesn't hurt you, that's great! But wanting to marry and not being allowed to is hurting people like you or similar to you in some way, and it would also be great if you could empathise with what they are going through on some level, at least."}, {"id": "2n6ttn", "body": "So I am a 24 year old gay guy and I have been criticized by some gay guys for having no real interest in same sex marriage and admitting that its something that isn't going to affect my life in the slightest. \n\nI just see marriage (even the secular form) as a religious idea and it only still exists as a result of religion.
