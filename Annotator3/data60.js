I am also an avid Notre Dame fan, and Seahawks fan. \n\nI believe people watch sports for three reasons. \n\nFirst, they want to watch the best play at their peak. They want to see talent manifest itself. They want to see spectacular feats of strength, speed, intelligence, and dexterity. They want to see what humans are capable of when pushed to the limit. \n\nSecond, they want a connection with the human behind the athlete. For example, if I really wanted to, I could probably go to Denver and try to meet Payton Manning somewhere. Yeah it would be creepy, but I know he is a real person living somewhere, with a family, and a mortgage, just like me. I can go up to him and ask him how his kids are, what's the best place to get a steak, and so on. \n\nThird, they want something to root for. They want to feel invested in something bigger than themselves. They want to feel like they won the game, even though it was their team that won. \n\nLeague of Legends I believe is doing a mediocre job at the second area, and a pretty good job at the third. Games like smash do a great job at the first, but ignore the other two areas. \n\nUnless you play the game, there is little reason why anyone else would watch, especially if you take out everything it means to be a fan. \n\nFor example, I am a fan of Jason Zimmerman. I enjoy watching him play. He is unstoppable when he is on top of his game. His ability to think and adapt as well as his deep understanding of the game mechanics makes him a very enjoyable player for me to watch. But he also has his flaws. He has said in interviews he has depression problems. He didn't used to be very outgoing or personable for the longest time. He, however, want to prove people wrong, that he can be the best. \n\nHow many of you know who I am describing? \n\nWhat if I replaced Jason Zimmerman with Mew2King? \n\nThis is the problem.

Off the top of your head, what are their names? How would you introduce them to someone who has never watched league at a bar? \n\nOh that jungle his name is Meteos. Think about how cringe worthy that sounds if you didn't have any interest in the game. \n\nTLDR: eSports needs to move away from usernames, and start using real names to embrace the human element of sports that casual fans love.

The packaging of the eSports experience should be friendly to outsiders while still being informative to passionate fans. The games themselves do not have to be dumbed down. \n\nSports broadcasts often explain relatively mundane details and provide context through stats so that people who may be unaware of the significance of something can be made aware of it.

American football is certainly complicated and difficult to follow for someone who has never seen a game but the broadcasts do their best to be informative to all types of viewers. The SuperBowl, for example, which is watched by more casual fans is generally commented in such a way that is *more* friendly to people unfamiliar with the game and personalities. Major events like the Dota World Championships should be done the same way.\n\n&gt; Under the current status quo, there is a sufficiently large backing to Esports that there isn't a scarcity of people to talk to about it.\n\nI would *strongly* disagree with this statement. In an average social situation with an average group of people you could expect precisely 0 people to have *any* familiarity with eSports. It is still very much a niche hobby.\n\n&gt;So you can't bring it up at the water cooler. Not that big of a deal.\n\nOf course.

You don't watch Jason Zimmerman or William Hartman when you watch eSports, you watch the screen, and you watch the Marth, or the Sheik, or Elise, or Lee Sin. With that, there's already a disconnect between the fans and the humans behind the in-game avatars that will never be bridged in the same way as actual sports. Being a gamer intrinsically means that you are representing yourself with something else on a screen, and in that I think we could agree that it is MORE acceptable for eSports to use nicknames, than it would be for real sports, if not still unacceptable overall in your eyes. Stick with me if you can agree with that much.\n\nWould eSports fans like to see more real names over fake names in eSports? Or would it just make it more accessible for non-gamers? In my experience, and you may disagree, I think that fans prefer to see the nicknames as the player's identities, because it gives them something to strive for with their own username. People create these names as alternate personas, and usually use the same name for multiple different games. It becomes their online identity. For people at the peak of competition, they have spent hours, days, and even years playing under \"Meteos\" or \"Mew2King.\" Especially in the case of League of Legends, these players first met future teammates under their psuedonyms, first competed in tournaments under these names, first streamed to 20,000 people under these alternate identities. Should they have had their real name be their identity the entire time? Or should they suddenly switch once they \"make it big?\" People are born in glory THROUGH these names, so it only makes sense for them to continue using them once they really make it big. While using real names might make it \"easier\" for ESPN to want to do interviews, I don't think that it is a true issue when it comes to keeping us out of mainstream. While there are a lot of things that eSports can learn through big sports broadcasting to improve the scene, names/nicknames just isn't one of them. The nicknames of players gives a stronger connection to the casual player, which is the expanding audience that eSports should focus on, not people that don't understand why nicknames aren't weird for us.

But that's not going to happen because it's creepy and he would likely just ask you to leave because it isn't appropriate.  Esports has streaming and for the most part that is all about the human element.   You get to see the player's reactions, potentially ask them question.  Everything about streaming is a much more real human thing than an interview about Zimmerman's depression.\n\nEsports has the human element.  Scarra has responded to a question of mine on Twitch, I've beaten Reginald, Bjergsen, Nightblue.  I've played with Mrn and against Lautemortis.  These are things that I think are much more human than any interaction I could possibly have with Peyton Manning.  \n\nEsports isn't limited by its human element because it has a better human element than any other sport.  Just because I call him Meteos doesn't mean I don't think of him as a human, because I do.  When I got my picture taken with C9, there were 5 real people there that I could relate with.  When Hai was in the hospital over All-Star break it felt incredibly human seeing his tweets supporting Link.\n\nI think you're overstating vastly the amount that using a username gets in teh way of the human element because it doesn't.  Using their username in no way prevents me from being able to connect with my favorite players on a human level.\n\nYeah, their real name gets lost to oblivion, but they don't.

I know they're people, but I know nothing about them. David Krejci is on my fantasy hockey team. If he wasn't on my favorite team and my fantasy team, I wouldn't care if he got injured. I pick people for my fantasy team because either they represent where I'm from or have good stats. Mostly is about stats. It's a numbers game. I think that's why most people like sports. They like to root for their home team. To a degree, you can do this with esports. Mang0 vs. Armada can be seen as USA vs. Sweden. Azen vs. Ken was East Coast vs. West Coast. If you don't look at that, then you pick them because of their character. I'm a huge fan of Darkrain and BizarroFlame because they play my two favorite characters: Captain Falcon and Ganondorf. I know nothing about them. When it comes to the five gods I root for Armada and PPMD because I think Sweden is a pretty great country and I like Peach, while PPMD lives in the same state as me.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, who cares. They don't need to have a serious name. I can't stand when ESPN does the inside look at players or whatever. I watch the game to watch the damn game. ESPN is the real joke. They've become a oversensational news station. There have been whole segments that have absolutely nothing to do with sports. Not a single person in the segment played, managed, or commentated, but they got an hour block on the Entertainment and *Sports* Programming Network. I'm not saying no one likes those segments, but the majority of the people I know don't. This really doesn't have much to do with the topic, other than ESPN being a joke already, so having an interview with M2k wouldn't be a huge detriment.\n\nAnyways, I really don't think the human element is what most people care about. Most people like players because they're good. If not, then they're probably just rooting for the underdog. The names might throw people off initially, but they probably won't care once they see them play.\n"}, {"id": "2lvskv", "body": "I play smash, and used to play LoL, so most of my references come from those communities.

Riot Games even makes videos of the players and their personal stories (Dyrus's father, SSW rise to victory in Season 4, Cloud 9 gaming house). All of these help us feel closer to the players and establish empathy with them. I hardly knew anything about SSW until Riot's video [SSW's return to Worlds.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbPGj9gXtQM&amp;list=UUvqRdlKsE5Q8mf8YXbdIJLw)\n\n&gt;This is the problem. How is espn going to take an interview with \"Mew2King\" seriously? How are they going to go to a tournament and say Grand Finals is between ChillenDude88 and Chu Dat. Who are these people? \n\nFirst of all, I don't think eSports should ever be on ESPN or FOX or anything of the sort. It defeats the whole movement of what eSports is about. We don't want cable packages and premium channels. The majority of League of Legends players are between the [ages of 14-25](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1aohu2/league_of_legends_players_age_survey/). People living with their parents or in the college dorms may not be able to persuade others to purchase cable packages or even afford them. I am 25 and I don't even have a basic TV package. With Netflix, Hulu+, and CrunchyRoll I don't need to have a TV/DVR. Most of my friends are the same way. eSports is just another method to help push the industry away from big media/television and onto the internet (similar to Pandora, YouTube, and Spotify pushing the music industry away from traditional radio\u2014think of Lindsey Stirling). Radio and TV were once mainstream, and they may be quickly going away.\n\nSecond, compare the views of [LOL eSports videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/LoLChampSeries/videos) to that of [ESPN](http://awfulannouncing.com/2014/espn-ratings-buzz-august-4-10.html). Football doesn't even show up in the Top 10 programs until you get to College Football on ESPNU. NASCAR is the highest viewed \"sport\". Twitch.TV on a daily basis has ~100,000 viewing League of Legends around the clock. Season 3 World Championships (2013) had [32 million people watching on Twitch.TV and ~13,000 seats available.](http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/19/5121688/league-of-legends-season-3-world-championship-finals-viewers) Season 4 (2014) was held in South Korea with 45,000 seats (Since this was in South Korea the show was rebroadcasted for US viewership. [2014 Worlds Finals has over 2 million views on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY-hTW1W-DU&amp;list=UUvqRdlKsE5Q8mf8YXbdIJLw) and [114,000 views on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/profile/past_broadcasts). It is harder to find more solid numbers, but here is some of the [coverage on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2jnyxd/spoilers_league_of_legends_season_2014_world/)). They also had [Imagine Dragons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJOW2IyxDtU) play live. While these numbers are still shy of Super Bowl XLVII ([108.69 million U.S. viewers](http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/19/5121688/league-of-legends-season-3-world-championship-finals-viewers)), this gap could close quickly if eSports continues to have concerts with famous bands and half-time shows. Just compare to the viewership of the [World Cup](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/14/world-cup-final-viewers-record_n_5585861.html). eSports are not too far from these numbers and may continue to grow larger.\n\nObviously there is overlap between viewers who watch sports on ESPN and eSports (especially considering there are [NFL players on League](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO2URqoUBnU). This doesn't even take into account StarCraft, DOTA 2, CS:GO, or Hearthstone.

They are abusing their relationship of dependence with their customers. They are taking a service that someone paid for on the promise of a specific speed and lying, all in the name of undermining competition and driving themselves into monopolies. We already have issues with the monopolization of the internet. Most people don't have a lot of broadband high speed options, and most ISPs stay out of each other's territory. And with the Comcast-Time Warner merger up, we might just see an industry become almost completely without competition and therefore the drive to innovate. Innovation comes from having an open market with lots of companies all fighting for consumer attention. It's about having the better product or service which gives you the merit to earn your customers.

I would submit to you that jail is an excessive punishment for that and we do not punish guilty minds that harshly in any other context unless harm has been done.\n\nI would likewise put it to you that it is a waste of taxpayer money to hold someone incarcerated to teach them a lesson and in fact jail does not teach people a lesson and recidivism rates are shockingly high as a result.\n\nI would also put it to you that a criminal record has serious negative economic effects on a person going forward and economic struggles are the top predictor of future criminality.\n\nFinally I would suggest that people who support marijuana laws have something to answer for themselves in causing a huge amount of harm to society in order to prevent a harmless vice.

If you're going 60 in a 30 zone, people *expect* you to be traveling at 30 but you're not, so you're putting people at risk.  If you cross where there's no crosswalk, cars don't know that they'll have to stop for you, so you're creating an unsafe condition.  Violating these road rules puts people in danger specifically because people need to be able to predict what you'll do in order to move about safely.  If you're driving at 30 in a 60 zone, that's also dangerous!  In many places there are posted *minimum* speed limits as well.  It's all about the flow of traffic.\n\nOn the other hand, marijuana isn't that.  If you break the law by possessing or even selling marijuana, you're not putting anyone at risk by virtue of breaking the law.  See, driving at 60 miles per hour or crossing the street are not crimes; what is a violation is going much faster than the flow of traffic or crossing where cars don't expect it.  But for marijuana, the crime is just owning or using some.  There are no victims.  What is the point of holding a person prisoner in such a case if the original violation is no longer a crime?  It's a waste of resources, and there's no real deterrent because the person's original crime is now legal.\n\nYou shouldn't confuse criminal laws with regulations.  Regulations are simply the rules of the game; if you break these regulations, you're cheating, which is bad in itself: doing X is unfair so build your business around not doing X.  Criminal laws refer to crimes that are bad in themselves: doing Y is bad therefore Y is a crime.  If society repeals both the regulation against X and the law against Y, then doing X is no longer unfair so you can change your business practices, and Y is no longer bad.  If you did X before the repeal, you were cheating then and gaining an unfair advantage.  If you did Y before the repeal, you were committing an act that was considered bad, but that same act is no longer considered bad.  Your punishment for doing X was for cheating; your punishment for doing Y was because Y was bad.  If X is no longer cheating, well, that's OK because when you did X *then*, it *was* cheating.  But Y is simply not actually considered bad anymore."}, {"id": "2lvawn", "body": "Edit: thank you kingbane for your great post: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2lvawn/cmv_people_that_get_jailed_for_committing_an/clyichz my view had been changed\n\n\nNow with states starting to legalize marijuana a lot of people are saying that people who got jailed for smuggling/using marijuana should be release.

There are many, myself included, that believe the vast majority of drug laws (all those that don't involve violence, fraud, or similar harm to others) are not just unreasonable, but outrageous; anathema to the concept of a free society.  Just because society is taking its sweet time to wake up to that, doesn't somehow change whether the law was reasonable or not.  BUT, your question wasn't specifically about drugs.  However, the question of reasonablness still exists.  Did a law change because society *realized* it was a *fundamentally unjust* law, or because society decided to *reorganize* itself in a way that made the law merely *unnecessary*?\n\nIn fact, you admit by your own words that not all laws are equal, when you exclude unreasonable laws.  The only question then is, what's reasonable?  The sterile impartial social scientist might say something like, there's a continuum you see; on one end are the heinous laws like apartheid (evil), and on the other are laws that make you heinous for the breaking, like premeditated murder (good).  In a given domain, like drug use, society might slide along the scale, and when the norm of society is such that a particular law is far enough away from the norm, in the \"evil\" direction, we call that law unreasonable, and decide everybody should get a pardon.  Actually, I'm fairly certain a window very much like this exists, and I forget its name.\n\nThe problem with this scale idea (as I've articulated it, I'm not trying to denigrate any scholarship here) is that it presupposes that society, majority rule basically, decides what morality is.  That goes against the idea that people have inalienable rights, since it allows for the possibility that if the mob wants, it can take away whatever rights of yours it wants.  So, when determining reasonableness, we can't just rely on society, on majority rule.  This concept, btw, definitely has a name: [Tyranny of the Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).\n\nThere are certainly some laws that for various reasons, deserve punishment even if they are later changed or repealed.  But I think you'll find that in many *reasonable law* situations where that is the case, the fundamentals of the law have not actually changed, only the real-world implementation details.  Fined for jaywalking and they later paint a crosswalk?  You broke the laws of the road, which are there to preserve safety.  The particulars of *your situation* don't matter that much, only that you violated a social contract, a set of rules that people agree on, *and that are reasonable*."}, {"id": "2lvawn", "body": "Edit: thank you kingbane for your great post: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2lvawn/cmv_people_that_get_jailed_for_committing_an/clyichz my view had been changed\n\n\nNow with states starting to legalize marijuana a lot of people are saying that people who got jailed for smuggling/using marijuana should be release.

For example you pull up to a red light at 4am. No one else is on the road. If you pull away before the light changes to green you have just broken a law. Why is their a law that says you must sit at a red light until it is green? Is the intent of that law to keep people safe? Maybe so when traffic is heavy but not so much at 4am when your the only person on the road. The intent and function of a red light is so people can make turns safely. You don't need a law for that. You should just have one law that is drive safely. So if you can safely run the red light then do it. If you run a red light and plow into a school bus you have just broken the drive safely law and will be punished accordingly.

It will prefer to add  more  space  between  the  words  in  a  line  to  push  the  last  word  over to the next line, rather than break up a word. But sometimes the word causing the problem is a rather long word. In this case, the amount of space they would need to add would be distracting. \n\nFor this, there would be a couple of possible solutions. The program could go to the line above the troublesome line, and try adding space to knock the last word of that line down, which might make it possible to add the spaces to the troublesome line and knock the too-large word over onto the next line. It can keep trying this for all the lines before the troublesome line, at least until it gets to the beginning of the paragraph. Most of the time, this is able to resolve the problem. But if the problem occurs early in a paragraph, the options are limited. Rather than create too much space (which would be distracting), it's better to hyphenate a longer word between lines. But, as I said, there are other options which should be explored first.\n\n(Also, pushing a long word to the next line may cause a cascading effect, wherein multiple problems are created later in the paragraph. Better to hyphenate the one word than to have to hyphenate two later on.)\n\nSo, hyphenating has it's place as a weapon of last resort. This is why you only see it rarely. (It will be more common when the total width of the text space is smaller, such as in newspapers, since it's easier to have \"too much space\" when there is less space to begin with.

In 1967, the Supreme Court overturned laws prohibiting interracial marriage, yet churches were allowed banning it if they wanted. The LDS Church, for instance, continued to prohibit blacks from receiving the priesthood (which in Mormonism, also restricted their access to the temple--which meant no blacks were allowed to be sealed to their families for ever or enter the celestial kingdom; i.e. the central point of Mormonism), as well as a ban on interracial-marriage. It wasn't until 1978 that the LDS Prophet had a prophecy to overturn the ban.  So there was a whole decade the LDS Church was engaging in racist activities, yet legally, it was fine. There were people who were mad, of course, even some pushing that the LDS Church should lose its tax exempt status. But that never went anywhere because the LDS Church was breaking no laws.  They probably received \"revelation\" from peer pressure in that the rest of the country was disgusted by their behavior, hence the eventual change. But it wasn't from government forces. They could change their mind and go back to their previous stance, and the government wouldn't do anything.\n\nSame with many other churches.\n\nThe argument that we'll be forcing churches to marry gays against their will is a lie pushed by opponents of same sex marriage to scare the religious into opposing it.

Appeals to tradition for the sake of tradition is nothing more than expressing an opinion.\n\n&gt;Homosexuals can get the same benefits as heterosexuals through alternative means, such as contracts written up with a lawyer - living together, having common property, etc. If this is hard or impossible, one can improve laws to streamline this process, but without influencing the concept of \"marriage\".\n\nThis is a semantic game based on the fallacy of the previous one: complicating the law and taking a \"separate but equal\" approach are proven negatives, and the supposed justification is the arbitrary reverence of what marriage is said to mean \"traditionally.\"\n\n&gt;Heterosexual marriages get tax benefits to encourage men and women to marry, which then makes them more likely to have children. Homosexual unions do not result in children so there is no reason for a financial incentive.\n\nThis is an often repeated misconception. If it were true then those tax breaks would be applied to the having of children, not just the act of marriage itself.\n\n&gt;The \"it's bad for kids\" argument has not been \"demonstrated to be false\", because that's completely based on opinion and by definition cannot be proved or disproved. You might however mean the argument in the following point.\n\nYes it has. There is absolutely no correlation, let alone causal link, between a society's acceptance for gay marriage and any increased metric for harm or decreased metric for wellbing in children. \n\n&gt;The government recognizing gay marriage is a step towards allowing homosexuals to adopt children (slippery slope). If this is what you mean by \"it's bad for kids\" being disproved, then that's not true either. Homosexual adoptions (especially 2-women households) have a noticeably higher rate of child abuse than heterosexual adoptions.

Decide if you want to encourage marriage or children, then tax accordingly. Changing what the incentive is for to suit your argument is shifting the goal posts.  If taxes are written to encourage marriage, without mentioning children, then claiming that it's \"for children\" or to \"encourage children\" is you putting your interpretation on it, and immaterial to the fact that there are separate tax breaks specifically for children.\n\n&gt;Misses the point entirely, this is purely value-based.

The traditional business model of journals was to take in articles, let other scientists review them (the scientists do that for free), and publish them if they get positive reviews. When you want to read such a journal you have to pay a huge fee, often $30+ per article. Universities usually have subscriptions to many journals, which often costs $10,000+ per year for one journal. Clearly that was ridiculous since the scientists are doing all the hard work of writing and reviewing the articles, and then they even have to pay to read other scientists' work. Especially in an era where a PDF can be hosted virtually for free, that's crazy. It's also bad because the research is often funded by taxpayer money, and taxpayers don't have free access to the articles.\n\nThen came the open access journals, like PLoS. Instead of charging the readers, they charge the writers. In order to publish in a PLoS journal you have to pay $1350 - $2900 ([source](http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/about-journals.gif)), though this fee may be waived under special circumstances. Like the traditional journals, PLoS has scientists who do the reviewing for free, and they have scientists who do the editing for free.

If necessary to prevent spam you could require that each reviewer is a known scientist. A known scientist is somebody who either published an article in an existing journal, or somebody who published an article on said website that got at least 1 good review from a known scientist.\n\n&gt; Well, no, not nothing.

The skills and knowledge of the reviewers matter; the skills and knowledge of the editors matter. A democratized version treats everybody as equals or, when it scales, it scales based on populism of that person. That is a fairly easy system to corrupt.\n\nThe readers can see who is the reviewer. If I see a review by a random person I'm not going to treat that as equal to a review by somebody who has tons of publications in the field.\n\nI don't think the death by populism is a big danger, and if it does become a problem, which I find very unlikely, it's easily solvable. Furthermore, with current journals it is *very* often the case that the journal asks somebody to review an article, and that person lets one of his PhD students write the review. When reviews are public, that practice will be much reduced, and the name of the reviewer will be far more likely to be the name of the actual person who did the reviewing."}, {"id": "2lugri", "body": "Science is published in journals. The traditional business model of journals was to take in articles, let other scientists review them (the scientists do that for free), and publish them if they get positive reviews. When you want to read such a journal you have to pay a huge fee, often $30+ per article. Universities usually have subscriptions to many journals, which often costs $10,000+ per year for one journal. Clearly that was ridiculous since the scientists are doing all the hard work of writing and reviewing the articles, and then they even have to pay to read other scientists' work. Especially in an era where a PDF can be hosted virtually for free, that's crazy. It's also bad because the research is often funded by taxpayer money, and taxpayers don't have free access to the articles.\n\nThen came the open access journals, like PLoS. Instead of charging the readers, they charge the writers. In order to publish in a PLoS journal you have to pay $1350 - $2900 ([source](http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/about-journals.gif)), though this fee may be waived under special circumstances. Like the traditional journals, PLoS has scientists who do the reviewing for free, and they have scientists who do the editing for free. So the only real value that PLoS adds is to put a PDF on the web, and for that you pay $1350 - $2900. Note that that money is mainly coming out of taxpayer's pockets in the form of research grants. Compare that with the humanities, where open access journals usually don't charge *anything* to publish an article.\n\nMy view is that this is ridiculous, and journals like PLoS should be replaced by a simple web site where scientists can submit their articles and other scientists can submit reviews of those articles (anonymously if they wish). A government can fund such a website for virtually no cost compared to the total research budget, and it should require that all articles coming out of taxpayer funded research are submitted to that website.

With traditional journals the only information you get is that the article got positive reviews by some people that were selected by the journal. You don't know who those people are.
