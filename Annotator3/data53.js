Ancient humans had complex relationships also - so your assumptions here about ancient civilizations are over-simplistic and not really based on historical evidence. Some ancient folks had 2-person relationships; some didn't.\n\nWhich is to say, no, humans are not meant to be monogamous. Humans are meant to survive, period. That's it. Which means humans are meant to be adaptable. Which means humans are meant to not only be adaptable as individuals, but also as a species/group. Which means some people will fall more on one side of a spectrum, and others will fall more on the other.\n\nAll of which is to say, the natural state of humans appears to be to have there be a tension between the desire to partner/pair up and reproduce, and the desire to still sex up people who are not your partner. Seems like a lot of what we choose to do with these desires is something that society has provided - similar to how we don't just steal what our neighbor has just because we want it or have less, but instead have learned to work together in ways that at least benefit the majority in certain ways. \n\nThis is true in many domains with people - our lot is to exist between a multiplicity of tensions of opposites. We want to be present-oriented to enjoy ourselves, but we have to be future-oriented to maintain longevity, and past-orientation can teach us a lot of things. Too much of any one and we'll be employing sub-optimal living strategies. In a society, some people can be too much one way, and others too much the other, and that's how everything gets done, as long as people don't start fighting over it. Which they often do, of course.\n\nLoyalty to one person isn't \"wrong,\" just as screwing everyone we could possibly want also isn't \"wrong.\" Both benefit us, just in different ways. Humans evolved to employ reason (at least to some extent) and so we can exercise that reason and try to sculpt the life and lifeview that we wish to use during the exceedingly brief time when we're alive. \n\nSo, no - humans aren't meant to be monogamous. But nor are we meant to be polyamorous, or whatever word you want to use to refer to having a multiplicity of partners. We are, however, able to do all of those things.\n\nThat said, you're all over the place. Cheating isn't coincidental; it's an indication of a relationship breakdown. It doesn't relate to evolutionary theory as much as a dynamic between two people. If someone wants to screw around, they can break up or create an open relationship. What you're talking about is dishonesty and betrayal. Relationships fail a lot because yeah people are dishonest and wounded and there's a lot going on. \n\n\"The one\" has nothing to do with it. That's romance movie talk. A good relationship has to do with being with someone you respect and love and are attracted to - and all that to an adequate enough degree. And you could screw other people, sure - but maybe you do want to be with your partner, so you willingly put that aside. Are there perhaps other, more attractive people out there? Sure, probably. But it's about maturity, and understanding that you have found someone good enough to spend your time with, someone you can be happy with. And there are a multiplicity of such other humans in the world that would work with you, and that you would work with. And so you find someone who you work well enough with, and who works well enough with you, and you create rules to establish a sense of emotional safety, which for the majority of the population is monogamy. And that's another important point - relationships are not only about sex. Emotional needs are even bigger, in my experience. The desire to be with someone, to not be alone, to be known, to have someone you know you can rely on - all those things are benefits of relationships. On reddit we tend predominantly see the worst relationship moments, the most dramatically messed up people, and since the loudest population on here is the youngest population - that 13-25 year old demographic - there is also a lot about sex, which gives a lot of people the mistaken notion that motivation for sex really, actually is the #1 thing keeping people together. It's up there, and it's huge, but it's a revolving carousel of really crucial shit, without which a lot of people feel their lives are the poorer for it.\n\nThis is not to say that being someone who actively eschews monogamy means you're unhealthy. However, it is a relatively small percentage of the population who can truly persist as polyamorous individuals. As I say, humanity is all over the spectrum - so these people are legitimately the way they are, and that's fine. That, too, doesn't constitute an indictment of monogamy - just as there being lots of dyed-in-the-wool monogamists doesn't constitute an indictment of polyamory. "}, {"id": "cm0licf", "body": "Firstly, when was this mythical time when we were \"cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on?\" What ancient world cultures are you referencing, from where, who were they - that entire thing is a variation on a golden age myth. Ancient humans had complex relationships also - so your assumptions here about ancient civilizations are over-simplistic and not really based on historical evidence. Some ancient folks had 2-person relationships; some didn't.\n\nWhich is to say, no, humans are not meant to be monogamous. Humans are meant to survive, period. That's it. Which means humans are meant to be adaptable. Which means humans are meant to not only be adaptable as individuals, but also as a species/group. Which means some people will fall more on one side of a spectrum, and others will fall more on the other.\n\nAll of which is to say, the natural state of humans appears to be to have there be a tension between the desire to partner/pair up and reproduce, and the desire to still sex up people who are not your partner. Seems like a lot of what we choose to do with these desires is something that society has provided - similar to how we don't just steal what our neighbor has just because we want it or have less, but instead have learned to work together in ways that at least benefit the majority in certain ways. \n\nThis is true in many domains with people - our lot is to exist between a multiplicity of tensions of opposites. We want to be present-oriented to enjoy ourselves, but we have to be future-oriented to maintain longevity, and past-orientation can teach us a lot of things. Too much of any one and we'll be employing sub-optimal living strategies. In a society, some people can be too much one way, and others too much the other, and that's how everything gets done, as long as people don't start fighting over it. Which they often do, of course.\n\nLoyalty to one person isn't \"wrong,\" just as screwing everyone we could possibly want also isn't \"wrong.\" Both benefit us, just in different ways. Humans evolved to employ reason (at least to some extent) and so we can exercise that reason and try to sculpt the life and lifeview that we wish to use during the exceedingly brief time when we're alive. \n\nSo, no - humans aren't meant to be monogamous. But nor are we meant to be polyamorous, or whatever word you want to use to refer to having a multiplicity of partners. We are, however, able to do all of those things.\n\nThat said, you're all over the place. Cheating isn't coincidental; it's an indication of a relationship breakdown. It doesn't relate to evolutionary theory as much as a dynamic between two people. If someone wants to screw around, they can break up or create an open relationship. What you're talking about is dishonesty and betrayal. Relationships fail a lot because yeah people are dishonest and wounded and there's a lot going on. \n\n\"The one\" has nothing to do with it. That's romance movie talk. A good relationship has to do with being with someone you respect and love and are attracted to - and all that to an adequate enough degree. And you could screw other people, sure - but maybe you do want to be with your partner, so you willingly put that aside. Are there perhaps other, more attractive people out there? Sure, probably. But it's about maturity, and understanding that you have found someone good enough to spend your time with, someone you can be happy with. And there are a multiplicity of such other humans in the world that would work with you, and that you would work with. And so you find someone who you work well enough with, and who works well enough with you, and you create rules to establish a sense of emotional safety, which for the majority of the population is monogamy. And that's another important point - relationships are not only about sex. Emotional needs are even bigger, in my experience. The desire to be with someone, to not be alone, to be known, to have someone you know you can rely on - all those things are benefits of relationships. On reddit we tend predominantly see the worst relationship moments, the most dramatically messed up people, and since the loudest population on here is the youngest population - that 13-25 year old demographic - there is also a lot about sex, which gives a lot of people the mistaken notion that motivation for sex really, actually is the #1 thing keeping people together. It's up there, and it's huge, but it's a revolving carousel of really crucial shit, without which a lot of people feel their lives are the poorer for it.\n\nThis is not to say that being someone who actively eschews monogamy means you're unhealthy. However, it is a relatively small percentage of the population who can truly persist as polyamorous individuals. As I say, humanity is all over the spectrum - so these people are legitimately the way they are, and that's fine. That, too, doesn't constitute an indictment of monogamy - just as there being lots of dyed-in-the-wool monogamists doesn't constitute an indictment of polyamory. "}, {"id": "cm0pije", "body": "Wow.

Animals that are monogamous share a number of traits. Monogamous animals tend to exist when both parents can contribute equally to the development of the young.

Our large brains require most of the brain to be developed in the womb taking up much of the resources. This means we have women with narrow hips giving birth to babies with large heads and tiny bodies.

When looking at other primates, we can get an idea of their mating behavior simply be the degree of sexual dimorphism in the species. If the males in a species are significantly larger than females then it means females are being sexually selective. Resources are probably limited in the environment and males that can defend and monopolize resources are get access to mate with several females. Now, other species of primates have almost no sexual dimorphism. This is most likely because resources are evenly distributed in an environment and females are more concerned with selecting males that will contribute in rearing offspring.\n\nAll this is to say that humans are confused. We fall somewhere in the middle of the continuum. Yes, males tend to be larger than females but not necessarily significantly so. While I agree that our species isn't \"meant\" to live in monogamous pair bonds, we also aren't \"meant\" to be polygamous. We typically engage in some form of both. Males are often equally invested in childcare. However, males and females also have sex outside of pair bonds.

There exist in the population of humans today individuals who exhibit monogamous behavior, and another cohort which exhibits non-monogamous behavior. (And, to be fair, a still smaller group which exhibits no sexual predilections at all.)\n\nIf there were a \"correct\" trait that humans were biologically \"meant\" to have, then it would already be universal. I know this sounds tautological, but please bear with me.\n \nWhen there's been selective pressure for a trait, then we tend to see greater uniformity across the population. For example, bipedal locomotion. Humans are \"meant\" to walk on two legs and have a forebrain because those traits were selected for over time.\n\nOn the other hand, when there's nothing selecting for a particular trait, then variations tend to proliferate. For instance, there was nothing in our past which selected exclusively for hair color, so we see much more variation among hair color across the population. It would be nonsensical from a biological perspective to say that because brown hair predominates, human beings are \"meant\" to have brown hair.\n\nRather, hair color is a group of traits that has several alternatives. Until a single hair color is selected for, by environmental pressures, sex selection, genetic drift, or some other mechanism as yet unidentified, that particular group of traits it will continue to be diverse.\n\nMonogamy/polygamy/asexuality are diverse traits in the same group of traits, just like hair color. Some individuals in the population exhibit monogamous behavior, and others exhibit polygamous behavior. This is confused a bit by the fact that all of this operates on a spectrum, from extreme promiscuity to total asexuality, and further muddled by the variety of religious, cultural, and philosophical compulsions that we have layered over biological tendency.\n\nBut on the whole I would argue that we have both biological tendencies in the population, and it would be silly to say one is \"correct.\"\n\nWhile I've already talked too long, you should look into studies that compare the relative size of genitalia among primates to the level of promiscuity among those populations. As I recall from college biology (I hope someone will correct me if this is false), gorillas are almost entirely monogamous, and have smaller genitalia relative to body size than humans, whereas chimps and bonobos (almost entirely promiscuous) have much larger genitalia relative to body size.

By your same argument, we're meant to eat cake and pizza because there are good evolutionary reasons why we crave sugars and fats.\n\nThe availability of sex today is nothing like it was back then. You can't judge an *ought* (\"meant to\") from an *is*, or this case, a *was*.\n\nHowever, to counter your point, *love* evolved as a way to keep us in pairs rather than serial partners. \n\nEdit: Generally speaking, males and females have different best interests when it comes to reproduction, so there isn't even a human \"meant to\". Males tend to maximize reproductive success, as a baseline, by impregnating as many females as possible. This is because the cost of reproduction is so low for men, and handful of calories and a ~~30~~ 2 minutes of their time. For females it's a huge investment of calories, time, risk of predators, difficult in gathering calories, then raising the offspring.\n\nSo females benefit by only having sex with males who are willing to stay around to help acquire calories and protect the woman and child from predators, and help raise the child. (We're talking over evolutionary times and wild conditions, not modern society.) Hence men end up maximizing reproductive success by actually being that type of guy that women chose to have sex with, which includes signs of commitment. \n\nAlso note that men have no value in committing to an unfaithful woman and end up raising some other guy's child without knowing it. So guys will tend to chose women who also show signs of commitment.\n\nAs a result we have at least serial monogamy as a result -- love that keeps people together and monogamous for \"long enough\". There are other strategies that work. Orangutans mate for life. Bonobos have sex often with everybody and tend to raise children communally, for instance.\n"}, {"id": "2m34jb", "body": "I don't believe humans are meant to be monogamous.

Obviously females for many species invest more by laying a giant egg or having a parasitic growth in their bodies in whose best interest it is to render her infertile. Good. Anyway, this makes female choosiness and male sluttiness, if you will, an evolutionary trope of sorts. In species where males have the higher investment, ie ornate moth males who gift the female a giant spermatophore containing nutrients, defensive toxins, and sperm, the females mate with multiple males, and males must be choosy about whom to give their sex present.  \n\nAlso looking at animal systems, in systems where one gender has disproportionate access to resources, that gender gets to have multiple mates. In some birds, females will choose the males with bigger territories, even if it means being that male\u2019s second mate, simply because the difference between that territory and the small territory of a bachelor is too great. Without aid from a male holding a resource-rich territory, the offspring will not survive, and so the female chooses the male with the superior territory. But, in another species of birds, African weavers, there is an overabundance of resources available. Females apparently do not need help from males to raise their young, and since weavers nest in colonies, they don\u2019t need a strong partner for nest defense either. So the female is free to choose any male to father her offspring, regardless of his other attachments. \n\n(So one day, when we make as much money as men, and have mad access to birth control, and can maybe grow our babies outside of our bodies or get some sort of equivalent contribution from our mates\u2026 we will be totally sexually free! And might be biologically totally sexually free in another zillion years but who actually knows because evolution doesn\u2019t really work like that!)\n\n\u2026Anyway, if we knew a bit about the environment we adapted for, we might be able to extrapolate from there and see what sort of system might have been selected for. Still, there\u2019s no guarantee the system we think might reasonably arise is the exact system we would have had. \n\nFinally, pretend we could see into the past and see EXACTLY how we behaved, what the system was like. What\u2019s to say your original question might still remain\u2014like what if we lived in communal cave-colonies, having mad sex like bonobos, because that\u2019s just what our social custom was? And a cavewoman would have felt burning shame and anger if her caveman didn\u2019t sleep with many, many cavewomen, as their primitive cavecustom dictates????

So the question is more \"do there exist humans for whom monogamy is perfectly natural?\"\n\nAs someone who's polyamorous (and has three girlfriends, one of who has two other boyfriends)... yes.  Some people are naturally monogamous.  I know, because I've dated a few of them.  Even though I never had any problems with them sleeping with anyone else and they had ample opportunity, they simply never wanted to.  It was simply their nature.  And of course they wanted me to be monogamous as well.  This did not work for me (which is why, obviously, we're not together).\n\nIn fact, generally polyamorous people regularly learn that some folks are simply downright monogamous (male and female, despite the stereotypes).

Citations to scholarly articles below.\n\n&gt;I think the human stride [bipedal locomotion] caused a problem for females: they became obliged to carry their babies in their arms instead of on their backs. In the trees, their quadrupedal chimplike ancestors had carried their infants on their backs. In that leafy universe a mother's hands were free to gather fruits and vegetables. And she could easily dash from predators to safe places high above the ground. But as our forbearers began to walk along the ground beneath the trees and out into the open plains, as well as carry sticks and stones to harvest dinner, I think females became overburdened.\n\n&gt;How could a young mother dig for roots and catch small animals with one arm while she carried a squirming, twenty-pound infant in the other? How could she sprint away from hungry lions that licked their chops as she toted armloads of bulky things? I believe these early females began to need mates to help feed and protect them\u2014at least while they carried and nursed a child.\n\n&gt;As pair-bonding became essential to females, it became suitable to males. How could a male protect and provide for a harem of females? Even if he succeeded in attracting a flock of women, other males would join his group to woo them, perhaps even steal away with one or more. But a male could provision and safeguard a single female and their nursing child. \n\n&gt;So as our forebears adopted life on dangerous ground, pair-bonding became imperative for females and practical for males. And monogamy\u2014the human habit of forming a pair-bond with one individual at a time\u2014evolved.^1\n\n&gt;We have some evidence that monogamy evolved long ago. Recently the bones of men and women living some 3.5 million years ago and known as *Australopithecus afarensis* were remeasured for skeletal size. As it turns out, males were somewhat larger than females, in fact sexes varied from each other in roughly the same proportions that modern men and women vary. Anthologists regularly use size differences between the sexes of species to gauge what sort of social group they lived in. And this size difference suggests these early relatives lived in the same sort of social units we do today: they were \"principally monogamous.\"^2\n\n1. Fisher, H. 1989.

That is, sex and romance aren't the same thing.\n\nThere are various benefits and drawbacks to various levels of sexual monogamy in species. Smaller, fast breeding species tend to have no monogamy. Species with long developmental times tend to have more monogamy. Both are valid tactics. Our closest biological relatives is an even split between Chimpanzees and Bonobos. Neither are sexually monogamous, and there's no compelling reason to believe that humans are biologically wired to be sexually monogamous either.\n\nYou want to know if sexual biology prompts is to be promiscuous? Yes. There, you can go home now.\n\nThe reason that that's not a satisfying answer is that sexual biology isn't all there is. Humans are self aware. We have psychology as well, and psychology is rooted in and can affect biology.\n\nWith self-awareness, and group behavior, we gained social needs. Social needs affect a person's psychological state, which affects a person's physical well being. With sexual biology, mating is about reproduction. With humanity's self-aware group psychology, mating is about Love (read: affection, infatuation, respect, desire, security, safety, comfort, etc.. I'll be using Love (capitol) to refer to all these aspects of relationships at once). Love (psychology) trumps lust (sexuality) most of the time in with humans because most of the time societal interactions (psychology) are more important for humans in matters of health, prosperity, and reproduction than base biological needs.\n\nOther users have posted that there is no \"should\" in this case. That's not quite right. What we \"should\" do is what is most conducive (individually and as a species) to survival, health, happiness, and advancement.\n\nSo while being sexually monogamous might not be optimal, being romantically monogamous can be. \n\nTo generalize, females benefit from monogamy because it helps to guarantee that their child will be cared for. For males monogamy is beneficial because it helps guarantee that their children are genetically theirs. Females are disadvantaged by monogamy because they could potentially get better genes for their child while with a worse mate. Males are disadvantaged by monogamy because multiple partners means more children (which may potentially be taken care of for free by another man).\n\nThat's the biology. Socially, however, both men and women benefit from monogamy. The implicit purpose of sex is reproduction. The choice to have sex and the choice to reproduce have become relatively divorced from one another in modern first-world society. However, all of the biological drives that males and females have for their children that are tied to mating have colored our culture.\n\nSex and Love are treated roughly the same societally. This is especially true once one is in a relationship. If one fails to be monogamous sexually, this is seen as a violation of monogamy relationally. This generally makes at least one person in the relationship very angry, which damages the relationship. Damage to a relationship generally causes all members of the relationship stress and emotional trauma. Stress and emotional trauma impact the advancement, happiness, health, and sometimes security of those damaged by the transgression.\n\nSo why should humans be monogamous? Because it hurts us not to be. This obviously isn't the case across the board, because some people are clearly capable of happy polyamorous relationships, but is true generally because people are selfish and unwilling (or able) to fully Love more than one person."}, {"id": "2m34jb", "body": "I don't believe humans are meant to be monogamous.

Its also likely that this was sexually selected against by women, because its less painful, so that wouldn't have been possible unless there was a semblance of monogamy as spiney penis male would have an evolutionary advantage. Yes, marriage is a social construct, but monogamy definitely isn't, as many animals mate for life. Furthermore, the development of humans further demonstrates the evolutionary advantage of monogamy. Human babies are born much less developed than other organisms, and as such have a much longer time in which they require protection to survive. While a lone female could protect her offspring, a male would offer the size and power advantage of protection, and a non monogamous male would kill off children that aren't theres, so its much more likely that a male would need to be present to protect the infant from other males. Even more, this development time (relatively long time in utero) serves to better develop the high number of neurons that give humans a more developed cerebral cortex than other proto-humans.

That would be pointless, because the next man to find any women you've laid seed in will kill your offspring and father his own offspring.  (Also the penis is shaped specifically to pump out the seed of any competing males in favor of your own, but that's besides the point). Historically, If you were not there to protect your young, there is a very high chance that they would not survive until adulthood.  \n\nIn order for your DNA to successfully survive long enough to propagate itself, you have to not just create the offspring, but protect them until they are old enough to defend themselves and reproduce on their own. This typically happens at around 12-15 years of age, which is why those were the unofficial ages of adulthood in medieval times (women tended to enter adult hood a little earlier then males).  \n\nNow it would also help your DNA if your children weren't poor, degenerate, alcoholic, anti-social, psychotic fuck ups. If they were, then they are less likely to attract mates themselves, and your DNA would not propagate. So you stick around, guiding them and teaching them, supporting them, etc. so that they can grow up to be fully functional human beings that are capable of reproducing.  \n\nMonogamy helps in all of this, and it isn't just an accident or coincidence that every single human culture in the history of the world has had the construct of marriage.

Women don't either. Homosexual people don't. Straight people don't. A lot of people of all orientations and backgrounds do not want to limit their love and sexuality to one person. You probably agree with that.\n\nStill, I think any evolutionary explanation for non-monogamy is going to be lacking. There have been cultures which thrived under all types of relationships. (Depending on your definition of thriving. There was probably still a lot of unhappiness and restrictive gender/sex roles.) \n\nA reason for why monogamy seems unsatisfying or impossible for many isn't as important as the fact that the situation exists. And we should live in a society that does not pressure anyone to have any type of relationship (with the exclusion of something harmful like pedophilia). If a woman wants to run for president, never have children, and never get married, she should be able to without criticism. People can be happy and healthy without any of those things.

It is ideologically driven, it has a monopoly on force in the state, it is often elected, it doesn't have shareholders or private owners (at least not in the same way that the private sector has).

But governments have formed, and either they were part of the market or they have subverted the market forces. But if they have subverted the market - how can they meaningfully be considered a force \"outside the market\"?\n\nPrivate actors could rule through force, start to hold elections, tax people and more.\n\nSo why should any government not be considered a part of a free market?\n\nTo clarify - I think there can be an argument that governments act in ways that betray the ideal of fair trade in a market, but the practical import of this is questionable - because private players in a market can also do the same. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This depends on the contracts involved but employment is part of a market of labor and firing people within the terms of their work contracts is a market activity. In a labor market a laborer agrees to sell their labor to a buyer and it's only a free market as long as this deal is made with the consent of both parties. Labor contracts can be used to specify details about an extended transaction. Labor unions and collective bargaining can participate in a free market but they'd need some advantages to function without outside control on the market.\n\n&gt;what about extortion,\n\nCoercion is a form of force. Not free market.\n\n&gt;or fear created demand like in the wake of a natural disaster?\n\nDemand is demand regardless of the source. One example my econ professor used involved someone buying a truck full of generators at some price (say $200) then driving several states to Louisiana and selling them for $600. There were still many people willing to buy at this price and so selling those was a free market activity. Those generators were needed and his markup was a response to market demand.

Monopoly on force. \n\nThe state has the ultimate monopoly on force. Even in a situation where private actors are granted the right to use force (such as PMCs or security firms) they must be given this right by the state. Any private actor trying to take this right, independent of the state, would be met with resistance (which is how civil wars start). \n\n2. The state makes the laws. \n\nPretty straight forward. Law plays a huge role in how the market operates, and the state is the only actor that makes law. Like the monopoly of force, even when private actors are allowed to make their own laws (contracts) they are doing so with the permission of the state, not in spite of it\n\n3. Central banking\n\nBit smaller, but each modern state has a central bank used to control the money supply and provide liquidity. Because this bank is run by the state and is not a private enterprise, it is able to exist outside the typical market rules, running up debts, providing liquidity during crisis, buying and selling money, etc. This role literally can not be done by a private enterprise because any privately owned bank would not be willing to provide liquidity or control the money supply during a time of crisis"}, {"id": "2m28ek", "body": "I see this dichotomy in discourse which treats the government as something \"different\", but I am unsure if it really is. \n\nI see the government as a result of various \"market forces\", the same way any other enterprise is. \n\nOf course - I don't mean that government is no different from the private sector.

I haven't studied any Macroeconomics yet (my first Macro class, \"Social Accounting and Introduction to Macro\" is going to start around May next year) but I do have studied a lot of Microeconomics (the same as \"Microeconomics I and II\" classes in my country), so I can tell what economists think when you view this from a microeconomic perspective.\n\nGovernment is a special agent that has unique powers due to coersion. It can correct market failure, successfully provide public goods but can make deadweight losses due to subsidies and taxation, for example. The main difference from companies is its drive: it is driven by social forces, not economic ones. It isn't a profit-maximizing agent (like companies) neither a utility-maximizing one (like individuals). Its role is much different.\n\nYou could say that government is inserted into free market logic, and you would be right.

I've seen instances recently of children in middle school learning simple integer division and multiplication.  When I consult my peers, future teachers, about this, they defend the system claiming that the teachers must teach to the test.  I find this unacceptable for several reasons, but most of those are unrelated.\n\nChildren have an outstanding capacity for learning when faced with the proper motivation, any argument that a child simply cannot handle more difficult content is insulting.  This assumption that children don't hold the ability to learn at a higher rate often results in a failure to reach the fullest potential.  In addition to this failure on the education system's part, it instills a sense of complacency within children that they should never be challenged to learn something.  This becomes very clear as I watch courses become diluted and spread out over longer periods of time.\n\nSo what stands to be gained from increasing the rigor and difficulty of a child's education?  First let's analyze the benefits as a society.  After completion of a more rigorous curriculum, a student will have progressed much further in every math and science course.  In addition to this knowledge that is otherwise not learned, the student has a much more firm understanding of writing and reading comprehension, although the benefits for English and History are much more limited than in the applied sciences.  Let's choose an arbitrary number of years that the student was able to progress in addition to a standard curriculum, although any increase in progress will yield great results.  Just two additional years of applied math or science classes that can be taken as a result of a more difficult curriculum can prepare a student for a large number of college programs in those respective fields as well as any number of related fields.  Practically speaking, it prepares students for the applied sciences.  In the case that the student wants to pursue education in this field, they will have an easier time, and possibly save money.  Furthermore, the world will *always* need more bodies in the applied sciences.  \n\nJust look around, in the U.S. some of the most popular undergraduate majors are business, psychology, and communications.  In many instances, and no disrespect to those who study in those fields, students perceive the previously listed to be easier than other choices.  I've had conversations with people who chose to study each of those because they sounded fun or easy.  Any time someone can list easiness as a reason for choosing something of that magnitude is highlighting what's wrong with the decreased standards of education that I've mentioned.\n\ntl;dr: I could never support an education system that doesn't promote absolute excellence, why shouldn't we make it significantly more difficult.

Not to mention, in the USSR, one could quit school after 8 grades (14) and go to work or vocational school - and those kids never took your beloved calculus.\n\nA second aspect is that education in the 1900s was structured very differently. Science was still a fairly new thing, so students didn't study as much in terms of volume, and took subjects like botany, anatomy. The typical high school curriculum included a lot more humanities and languages (Latin, Ancient Greek), and everybody more or less read and translated the same things.

What do you think about students who see themselves as failures or less intelligent because they can't manage to learn at the same speed as the class, and as such, fall down a potential slippery slope. I don't see how a harder education curriculum would make students in this situation any better off.\n\n&gt;If every student is exposed to a larger variety of coursework, it gives them a larger pool of experience to sample from when choosing what they may want to do. I\n\nThis is true- and I don't think it's a bad idea, just that requiring students to take what amounts to advanced courses in classes they have minimal interest or skill in is a little silly. I think it's reasonable to experience a number of different subjects, but having to experience them at a higher level could potentially turn students off to the subject- especially if it's something they have trouble with.\n\n&gt;When I came to college I realized how much time was wasted in my education. In one semester of college level work (for some fields of study), you do more work than an entire 4 years in high school. \n\nYou do. I think that the system needs to be a bit tighter and the classes a bit quicker, but college and high school are quite different. In high school, teachers teach at the pace of the class. If your class has slower students, the class will be taught a little slower- if the class is quick, it will be taught quicker. Professors don't have to do this. They won't slow down unless the bulk of the class is getting hammered- and even then not by much.\n\nAgain, high school education is about building basic skills- it's not so much the information, but the practice you have, as outlined in my previous comment. While you could theoretically teach a class of high school students how to think critically, solve problems, and comprehend writing in a shorter amount of time, wouldn't this harm them in the long run? Wouldn't you want their basic skills more advanced than their trivial knowledge?\n\n&gt; There is very little difference between a 17 year old and an 18 year old.\n\nThere isn't, really. But there is in motivation, as you posted-\n\nIn high school, we haven't got much of a choice of what we want to do. We learn better when we are doing things we like. When we get to post secondary we are able to pick(for the most part) our classes and what we will be learning- if its something we are passionate about, we learn it easier. It's why for some people(including myself) doing business math is much easier than doing the math we learned in high school. If we judge the information to be relevant and useful, we will learn it more- if we know that the information(not the skills) to be useless- such as what year the hundred years war started in, we will not retain the knowledge and have a more difficult time learning it.\n\nI think you're right, and the system does need an overhaul. At the same time, I think making the information learned more relevant and useful to daily life is a better strategy than simply making the course harder.\n\nI have to get some sleep here- so I will happily respond to you tomorrow!

Not from the perspective of what their educational capacity is, but rather what type of person they were, are, and are going to be.  The societal perspective of a 17 year old vs 18 year old is considerable. .

Careers focused in fields that offer minimal benefits of participation outside of a paycheck should be limited.  Of course, some of these are necessary, but I believe that positions like this are currently overfilled to the point of saturation.

As I went on in the world, I realized that the education system doesn't cater to ~~geniuses like me. \n\nAfter going through the lower education system and entering an applied math program, I knew after my first semester that my time had been wasted for at least the previous 6 years.  After years of doing nothing for my good grades in high school, I was quickly forced to adapt to a system that required self motivation and manufactured knowledge.  This is a combination of traits that I was not able to master until recently, and these traits would have been very helpful if I had been forced to learn them at an earlier age.  I stand now, 6 months away from graduating in applied math and physics, applying to graduate school for nuclear engineering.

Offering a more intense and by extension more diverse curriculum provides more opportunities to develop an understanding of what a student holds interest in.\n\n&gt;Basically, that's literacy and numeracy, and further, that's teaching children, say, common American values, so that when you meet a stranger in America, you can be reasonably sure that they can read a contract, give change for a dollar, and know something about slavery via To Kill a Mockingbird. \n\nWhy don't we just make the standards even lower then so that *everyone* can stand on the same floor?

If you feel like you're not challenged in school, you have to enroll in a more difficult program, take college classes, read in your free time - granted, in America, these resources are freely available to you.\n\nAgain, why not make the standards even lower then and let those with the highest motivation take advantage?  That's because promoting a system that promotes less knowledge just sounds silly.  Every day people take the tougher road because it possesses a more fruitful reward, and every day people reap the benefits of those decisions.  Why should education be any different? \n\nI've done my part, I'm not blaming society for my lack of success.  As I mentioned before I'm applying for graduate school as we speak.  What irks me greater than anything is the complacency with mediocrity.

Careers focused in fields that offer minimal benefits of participation outside of a paycheck should be limited.  Of course, some of these are necessary, but I believe that positions like this are currently overfilled to the point of saturation.  The applied sciences offer benefits for humanity as a whole on multiple levels.  So while the marginal benefit of adding mediocre workers in those fields will decrease over time, the reduced benefit is still better than a vast majority of jobs that fall under the useless category that should be minimized.\n\n&gt;When I was finishing high school (as I imagine you are doing now), I had this opinion. As I went on in the world, I realized that the education system doesn't cater to ~~geniuses like me. \n\nAfter going through the lower education system and entering an applied math program, I knew after my first semester that my time had been wasted for at least the previous 6 years.  After years of doing nothing for my good grades in high school, I was quickly forced to adapt to a system that required self motivation and manufactured knowledge.  This is a combination of traits that I was not able to master until recently, and these traits would have been very helpful if I had been forced to learn them at an earlier age.  I stand now, 6 months away from graduating in applied math and physics, applying to graduate school for nuclear engineering.  Somehow I feel I would have been better off had I not been taught at a snail's pace for years approaching college.  \n\nRegarding most of the remainder of your response, I'll do my best to address \n\n&gt;The education system's number 1 purpose is creating a common platform between the citizens of a society.\n\nI don't agree with this, I see the education system as a vessel to provide the tools to build a life for every child.  Offering a more intense and by extension more diverse curriculum provides more opportunities to develop an understanding of what a student holds interest in.\n\n&gt;Basically, that's literacy and numeracy, and further, that's teaching children, say, common American values, so that when you meet a stranger in America, you can be reasonably sure that they can read a contract, give change for a dollar, and know something about slavery via To Kill a Mockingbird. \n\nWhy don't we just make the standards even lower then so that *everyone* can stand on the same floor?  I'll bet many parents would love this, their child would never be considered unintelligent.\n\n&gt;Get this: \"absolute excellence\" is something you have to pursue - it's not up to society to provide you with that. If you feel like you're not challenged in school, you have to enroll in a more difficult program, take college classes, read in your free time - granted, in America, these resources are freely available to you.\n\nAgain, why not make the standards even lower then and let those with the highest motivation take advantage?  That's because promoting a system that promotes less knowledge just sounds silly.  Every day people take the tougher road because it possesses a more fruitful reward, and every day people reap the benefits of those decisions.  Why should education be any different? \n\nI've done my part, I'm not blaming society for my lack of success.  As I mentioned before I'm applying for graduate school as we speak.  What irks me greater than anything is the complacency with mediocrity.  Great things can't be made if the minds that make them never come to be, and these improvements to curricula will certainly increase the amount of great minds that the world sees.\n\n&gt;What do you mean?

EDUCATORS HATE HIM!"}, {"id": "2m1nic", "body": "Currently, primary and secondary education standards in the U.S. seem to have dropped to the floor.  I've seen instances recently of children in middle school learning simple integer division and multiplication.  When I consult my peers, future teachers, about this, they defend the system claiming that the teachers must teach to the test.  I find this unacceptable for several reasons, but most of those are unrelated.\n\nChildren have an outstanding capacity for learning when faced with the proper motivation, any argument that a child simply cannot handle more difficult content is insulting.  This assumption that children don't hold the ability to learn at a higher rate often results in a failure to reach the fullest potential.  In addition to this failure on the education system's part, it instills a sense of complacency within children that they should never be challenged to learn something.  This becomes very clear as I watch courses become diluted and spread out over longer periods of time.\n\nSo what stands to be gained from increasing the rigor and difficulty of a child's education?  First let's analyze the benefits as a society.  After completion of a more rigorous curriculum, a student will have progressed much further in every math and science course.  In addition to this knowledge that is otherwise not learned, the student has a much more firm understanding of writing and reading comprehension, although the benefits for English and History are much more limited than in the applied sciences.  Let's choose an arbitrary number of years that the student was able to progress in addition to a standard curriculum, although any increase in progress will yield great results.  Just two additional years of applied math or science classes that can be taken as a result of a more difficult curriculum can prepare a student for a large number of college programs in those respective fields as well as any number of related fields.  Practically speaking, it prepares students for the applied sciences.  In the case that the student wants to pursue education in this field, they will have an easier time, and possibly save money.  Furthermore, the world will *always* need more bodies in the applied sciences.  \n\nJust look around, in the U.S. some of the most popular undergraduate majors are business, psychology, and communications.  In many instances, and no disrespect to those who study in those fields, students perceive the previously listed to be easier than other choices.  I've had conversations with people who chose to study each of those because they sounded fun or easy.  Any time someone can list easiness as a reason for choosing something of that magnitude is highlighting what's wrong with the decreased standards of education that I've mentioned.\n\ntl;dr: I could never support an education system that doesn't promote absolute excellence, why shouldn't we make it significantly more difficult.  The benefits are there, why shouldn't we reap them? \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Politicians run on thing X and do thing Y all the time.  Obama ran *against* an individual mandate in health care.  He also originally said he'd pursue climate change legislation before health care reform.  And backtracked on various other things too.  Bush ran in 2004 on gay marriage and terrorism, and upon election dove right in to Social Security privatization, and never did anything on gay marriage.\n\nI remember Mitt Romney claiming he had no plans to push a pro-life agenda.  Well, that's BS.  Eventually President Romney would have to nominate SCOTUS judges.  And when he did, I guarantee they would be pro-life judges.  His party wouldn't allow him not to.  Just following the label would tell you more about his actions there than what he said.\n\nOften this isn't lying, but changes in circumstances, or the President's (or whoever's) inability to set the agenda.  Obama did health care, not energy, because he could, not because he decided to lie for the hell of it.  Same with the individual mandate.  Given Congress's input, Presidents can hope to push policy in a more liberal/conservative direction, but can't dictate all the specifics ahead of time.  You couldn't say, based on what Obama/McCain said in 08, what would happen with health care if they won.  But you could figure out that Obama would make things more in the direction of government control and more redistributive, and McCain would make it more free market oriented.  But you'd know that better from their party labels, than their point-by-point proposals.\n\n&gt; I get that most people know what the parties stand for, but not everyone is well informed on what issues are actually taking place.\n\nIn line with this, there are all sorts of issues that don't get talked about in campaigns, that you can guess how the parties will align, not based on anything they said, but on a basic sense of what the parties are in favor of.  These issues often are the ones \"actually taking place.\"\n\nExample - contraception mandate.  Not talked about at all in 2008, but became a major issue before 2012.  If you just based your votes on party labels, you could figure that Dems are generally pro-entitlements, and pro-stuff-for-women, and Republicans the opposite.  Trying to be an informed voter, figuring out what the specific stances on issues are and their relative priorities, would get you nowhere on that one.\n\nAnother - Trayvon Martin.  Got big in part due to Obama commenting.  No way you'd know this ahead of time, except that Democrats are more likely to see things as being due to racism, and more likely to talk about it that way.  A Republican President, and that case would likely have received much less exposure.  Perhaps more true of Obama than other Dems, but that basic dichotomy would happen with any D, compared to any R.\n\nOther examples - nominating judges, Title IX cases on campuses, what the Civil Rights division of the DOJ does, how strictly various regulatory regimes are enforced, all manner of unforseeable foreign policy stuff, policy minutia relating to immigration, or unions, or coal mining, etc."}, {"id": "cm046fa", "body": "Either way, the \"R\" or \"D\" allows people who didn't do research on the topic to feel as if they know who they are voting for.

What will an election look like when those people are voting for the nicest sounding name instead of an R or a D? Or when they're voting against the target of the most successful attack ad (regardless of the deeper truth)?\n\nThree, making voting harder will almost certainly reduce voter participation, and is likely to be viewed as disenfranchisement, particularly of the poor. Do you know how dismal the turnout for our last vote was? You want it to get worse? \n\nIn sum I don't think removing R's and D's from the ballot will have the effect you believe it will. \n"}, {"id": "cm0wnou", "body": "This! If a person understands enough to comprehend the general political stance of a party, and then decides that they agree with and wish to support them, how are they less fit to vote then a person who just saw a name they recognized from an ad?\n\nThe US already has weak political parties compared to most of Europe it wouldnt change anything from a practical perspective."}, {"id": "2m1h4h", "body": "The elections in the United States of America, as far as I understand, include the political parties of each candidate next to their name (D. for Democrat, R. for Republican, and any other letter for any other political party affiliation for other candidates)\n\nThis seems like an election to see which political party should win, rather than each candidate. It allows voters to vote based on their political party rather than their political views. While political views are supposed to be expressed through parties, you can have a liberal republican or a conservative democrat in topics important to you that you may not know just based off their political parties.\n\nA political party notice lets uninformed voters feel good for voting conservative/liberal, when really they may not even be voting for the most conservative or liberal person if they're uninformed. It's just voting for the party for these people. Informed voters know which person is of which party and it probably doesn't matter to them, just the candidate's views. Uninformed voters may just vote based off of political parties despite the fact the candidate may have unstereotypical views in some important topics.\n\nI've heard a few arguments hear and there but I really don't understand why the USA does this, so please, CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
