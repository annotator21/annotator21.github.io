On almost any popular post, the top comment is going to be the most witty and it's lucky if it's a full sentence. \n\nI don't think there's any use in trying to argue that Reddit as a whole is something aimed towards (or even the best medium) for changing people's opinions. Reddit, at its heart, is simply a collection of communities sharing what they find interesting in the world with eachother. \n\nWhat if your friend asked you to read over an assignment for them? You'd probably agree, it's not really a big deal for you to take a few minutes out of your day to do it. It's within your expectations. But what if they hand you a two part novel without any explanation?\n\nYou'd probably be pretty pissed and not nearly as interested in helping them out. Because that's not what you expected and it's unreasonable given the context of the request.\n\nSimilarly, most people who browse Reddit are not looking to have their minds changed or have a serious conversation. They're just looking. Looking to get away from work, looking to distract themselves from the bus ride, looking to waste time in class--but not looking to change their view on the world as they sit on the toilet trying to find funny pictures. \n\nLook at how controversial opinions are dealt with in most subreddits vs right here in /r/changemyview. Most people here refrain from using downvote as a disagree button because they came here expecting to be challenged. They don't feel threatened or annoyed because that's the purpose of this subreddit. The only time you really see people downvoted here is when the author is clearly not remotely interested in entertaining a different opinion (people who come here to argue). \n\nHaving a controversial opinion doesn't exclude you from Reddit even if you may be somewhat censored from the \"hivemind\" community. There are plenty of communities here where people are very happy interacting with eachother and the rest of Reddit almost universally despises them ( /r/theredpill is a good example). \n\nI do not think it's ever okay to harass a Reddit user, even one that I find morally abhorrent.

It's not that controversial opinions ruin the fun and discussion. What's the underlying problem is the lack of reddiquette. Down votes are not meant for \"op is stupid\" or \"op has an ignorant opinion\". But most redditors use them that way. So the problem is not the opinions, it's the use and abuse of karma. I think karma should be limited and over time you get more to give or take. It would make more people thoughtful of how they vote if they were only allowed to upvote x amount of times per day and down vote x amount of times per day.

The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized, something I am personally against. I asked why he was pro-legalization, stated one reason I am against it, and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion, I did not downvote him (I  upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote), and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. \n\nInstead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered, what I got was overly defensive comments (not from him, he did not reply) calling me an idiot just for having that opinion, downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it, being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise, and no real discussion to be had. I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account.

The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless.

I did not attack his opinion, I did not downvote him (I  upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote), and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. \n\nInstead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered, what I got was overly defensive comments (not from him, he did not reply) calling me an idiot just for having that opinion, downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it, being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise, and no real discussion to be had. I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E (/r/trees). It was /r/askreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.\n\nReddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like /r/offmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game, then what point is there in even posting your opinion if it's not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless. Intellectual conversation and debate on a topic is difficult when opinion is valued more than the quality of the post itself.\n\nSo please, change my view.\n\nEDIT: My Internet took a dive last night so I just decided to go to bed. I apologize. I will respond to everyone's comments individually when I am able to.\n\nEDIT 2: I apologize for the late replies. I got to doing this when I could.

What you are describing is true of every public discussion everywhere. If you are the lone person declaring the Earth is flat, people will disagree with you, laugh at you, and generally just want to ignore you. You'd get a thumbs down everywhere; it has nothing to do with reddit or karma.\n\nYou've also over-generalized. There is no singular reddit; it is a collection of sub-reddits, and what happens in one subreddit vs another will depend on the topic, the rules, the statistical interests of the commenters, and frankly, the timing. \n\nYou haven't demonstrated a single thing you claim are unique to reddit or karma. More importantly, you haven't suggested an alternative. If somebody goes on about how the Earth is flat, what would *you* think people should do?\n\nCertainly local populism is not the same as being correct, but reddit is not a scientific journal, nor should it be, and even scientific journals have a lot of publications that turn out to be incorrect. (In fact, most of them will be, which is why repeatablility is baked into the scientific process.)\n\nIt seems to me that you are expecting some sort of omniscience, or perhaps you are oblivious to your own self-interest. It should not be surprising that an unpopular view is unpopular.\n\nYou also have control over what you see on reddit, including karma thresholds. Is your complaint simply that you got downvoted? What does that have to do with discussion? You claim you were effectively *forced* to delete your post. Nonsense. Simply don't delete it. You keep referring to \"destroying\" and account, yours and somebody else's. What does that even mean? You are never stopped from posting. If you feel you are being targeted, start a new account. What difference does it make if it's the content of discussion that matters to you.\n\nIt looks more to me like you are personally putting a lot of weight on karma, and care about your account \"brand\". If you truly do care about the topics and the content of comments, then none of this stuff should matter. Heck, I don't even have a clue what my karma is and I don't check my messages. I'm completely interested in the discussions, not that my user \"brand\" is valued by others. \n\nJust make your points, listen to criticisms, respond with counterpoints, and if nobody cares or downvotes you, move on. If you still haven't convinced them, and they haven't convinced you, and nobody wants to talk about it more ... Well, welcome to life.\n\nIf you can design a better system, then give it a try. Create a website with that system.

OP cites a comment of his that apparently doesn't exist anymore in askreddit. First of all, that's not a debate-oriented sub.

For example, I remember a while back (I do not have a link, sorry.) of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it, and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made (or close to) was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed non-stop.

So in your case, we cannot categorise 'overweight people' as a homogeneous group. Each one of them is different, with different values.\n\nCommon to severely overweight people is eating as an addiction/anxiety control/depression. I would argue that in these instances, no, the weight gain:health loss is not worth it in terms of 'pleasure' from eating. If anything, their eating makes them feel worse. To give a simple example, someone who eats a whole pizza might enjoy the first couple of bites, and then enjoy continuing to stuff their face, but will feel terrible about it afterwards. This is not a net pleasure gain, in my opinion.\n\nYou're right in that, perhaps, someone could potentially believe putting their health at risk for weight gain is worth it. Someone who says 'no, I'm going to eat whatever the hell I want and be damned' could well believe that. But I don't think this represents a large portion of the overweight population, and certainly not the morbidly obese population. A strong case could be made that to do this a little is worth it (e.g. roasting chicken with butter rather than boiling chicken because it tastes better, but may not be so great for you).

Things can hurt, you're out of breath, your body is drenched in sweat.  But it's only temporary.  That displeasure goes away, and afterwards, when your body has calmed down, those endorphins are pumping through your body.  It reduces anxiety, it reduces pain, it creates a pleasurable feeling.\n\nCompare that to being a sloth, sitting on your couch, eating a family size bag of cheetos, watching your favorite TV show?  It's easy.  The couch is comfortable, the cheetos are tasty, and the TV makes you laugh.\n\nIn the short term, the happiness of being a fat lazy slob on the couch with a bag of cheetos wins out over the strenuous workout.\n\nBut in the long term, the exercise always wins.\n\nCheeto slob continues to put on the weight, to the point that even just walking becomes a problem.  Everything becomes a chore of work, everything is dreaded, except for the couch and that bag of cheetos.  Its hard to hang out with friends, because going anywhere on your own locomotion makes you feel awful.  You hate it. Walking is terrible.  \n\nThink about that, the most basic means of locomotion becomes anethma.\n\nEverything else makes you unhappy.  You look in the mirror, and you hate yourself.  You don't want to go anywhere, because even the bare necessities of physical exertion causes problems.  Looking at people who are healthy causes pain. Everything is depressing, except the couch and the cheetos.\n\nTheir health fails, and they know it, but change is to hard at this point, and they keep indulging in the short term vices, desperate to gain that little bit of happiness, to avoid the chronic pain of a body they've abused, of a life they hate.\n\nHow much net happiness has the overweight sloth gained?  They've sacrificed all other forms of happiness, just to gain the temporary pleasure of fat filled snacks and bad television.\n\nCompare this to the fit person who exercises regularly.  They know the endorphins are going to come, every time.  It feels good.  It feels good so often, that exercise stops being 'something to be done' and starts being 'something they want'.  They crave the elevated heart rate, the sweat, the little pains, because it makes them feel good.\n\nThey are free to explore the world.  Walk around their neighborhood, engage in activities. They look in the mirror and they feel good about themselves.  Other people tell them they look good, strangers compliment them.\n\nThey go through life, filled with positive reinforcement.

She is my best friend as well as my lover, and we do almost everything together. I don't want to marry her because I don't like the marriage and divorce laws regarding assets and debts. I see minimal benefit to a legal marriage, but a big risk if we don't work out as life partners. She is happy with how things are, but I think she would like it a bit if we were \"official\".\n\nI'm a little older than her, I have a good paying professional job, own the house we live in, and have some money invested in stocks. I invest a large chunk of my pay. I know what is mine before marriage would stay mine, but I am planning to continue to pay off my mortgage and invest a lot of my income. She is still in school, working on becoming a high-paid professional too. She will likely take out more student loans in the years to come. I am pretty certain she will continue to spend a lot more money than me on things like lattes and clothes. I am totally fine with this, but if we shared finances I would feel like she was buying stuff I don't care about with \"our\" money, and the money I was saving would also become \"ours\". I don't want to get married and pretend our finances are separate, knowing that if we get divorced the courts will split everything 50/50 (I live in a community property state, meaning assets and debts acquired during marriage are joint). I also don't want to do a pre-nup. To make it legit, both of us would need attorneys during the process, which is expensive. We already live like we are married, it seems silly to get the marriage certificate, and do more paper work to undo a big chunk of what the marriage certificate does. I'm also concerned that she would not like the pre-nup process, and it might make getting married not as fun.\n\nI am pretty certain I will accumulate wealth much faster than she. I want to share this wealth with her while we are together, but if for some reason we don't work out I want to keep what I have worked hard to earn, and not be responsible for any debts she may still have. Many times the lower earning person helps the higher earner to make more money. This is not the case with us, we split all the housework and stuff evenly. I'd be wealthier if I were single (mainly because I'd get roommates and charge them rent), but I have no complaints because I love living with my girl and spending some money so we can have a blast. On the flip side, I am pretty sure she will be wealthier with me than if single or with someone else. I know a lot about personal finance, I give her as much advice as she will tolerate (haha), and will encourage her to practice good financial habits and establish financial security of her own.\n\nWe don't have kids, but if we do we will figure out a fair way to divide labor, because we are both intelligent and can work out a good deal for both of us. If we think it is best for her to take some time off to be a SAHM, I am confident we will figure out a fair deal, including some compensation for missed career building. Or, maybe she'll SAH the first few years, and I'll SAH the next few years.\n\nI think the reason we have these divorce laws is because most people don't plan ahead for things. Divorce law is a crappy one-size-fits-all way to handle the problem, better than nothing but it still sucks. I have no problem publicly committing my love to the woman I want to spend my life with, but will not go along with the government dictating how we handle our finances. I don't want to get married, ever.\n\n*Edit: I have talked to her about all this. I also want to hear other opinions. Thanks!*\n\n*Edit 2: Her view on marriage changes a lot. Sometimes she thinks the whole thing is stupid and we should never get married, but sometimes she'll ask me if I want to. I think the rational side of her thinks it's dumb, but the emotional side of her feels kinda left out by not being married.*\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

She is my best friend as well as my lover, and we do almost everything together. I don't want to marry her because I don't like the marriage and divorce laws regarding assets and debts. I see minimal benefit to a legal marriage, but a big risk if we don't work out as life partners. She is happy with how things are, but I think she would like it a bit if we were \"official\".\n\nI'm a little older than her, I have a good paying professional job, own the house we live in, and have some money invested in stocks. I invest a large chunk of my pay. I know what is mine before marriage would stay mine, but I am planning to continue to pay off my mortgage and invest a lot of my income. She is still in school, working on becoming a high-paid professional too. She will likely take out more student loans in the years to come. I am pretty certain she will continue to spend a lot more money than me on things like lattes and clothes. I am totally fine with this, but if we shared finances I would feel like she was buying stuff I don't care about with \"our\" money, and the money I was saving would also become \"ours\". I don't want to get married and pretend our finances are separate, knowing that if we get divorced the courts will split everything 50/50 (I live in a community property state, meaning assets and debts acquired during marriage are joint). I also don't want to do a pre-nup. To make it legit, both of us would need attorneys during the process, which is expensive. We already live like we are married, it seems silly to get the marriage certificate, and do more paper work to undo a big chunk of what the marriage certificate does. I'm also concerned that she would not like the pre-nup process, and it might make getting married not as fun.\n\nI am pretty certain I will accumulate wealth much faster than she. I want to share this wealth with her while we are together, but if for some reason we don't work out I want to keep what I have worked hard to earn, and not be responsible for any debts she may still have. Many times the lower earning person helps the higher earner to make more money. This is not the case with us, we split all the housework and stuff evenly. I'd be wealthier if I were single (mainly because I'd get roommates and charge them rent), but I have no complaints because I love living with my girl and spending some money so we can have a blast. On the flip side, I am pretty sure she will be wealthier with me than if single or with someone else. I know a lot about personal finance, I give her as much advice as she will tolerate (haha), and will encourage her to practice good financial habits and establish financial security of her own.\n\nWe don't have kids, but if we do we will figure out a fair way to divide labor, because we are both intelligent and can work out a good deal for both of us. If we think it is best for her to take some time off to be a SAHM, I am confident we will figure out a fair deal, including some compensation for missed career building. Or, maybe she'll SAH the first few years, and I'll SAH the next few years.\n\nI think the reason we have these divorce laws is because most people don't plan ahead for things. Divorce law is a crappy one-size-fits-all way to handle the problem, better than nothing but it still sucks. I have no problem publicly committing my love to the woman I want to spend my life with, but will not go along with the government dictating how we handle our finances.

If we think it is best for her to take some time off to be a SAHM, I am confident we will figure out a fair deal, including some compensation for missed career building. Or, maybe she'll SAH the first few years, and I'll SAH the next few years.\n\nI think the reason we have these divorce laws is because most people don't plan ahead for things. Divorce law is a crappy one-size-fits-all way to handle the problem, better than nothing but it still sucks.

When it comes to a relationship you share with a person for life, I see it as being a team or a partnership. You should be with someone you trust is going to work as hard at both the romantic relationship and the business relationship as you are. When you *do* have that trust and partnership, then you shouldn't keep track of everything as hers and mine. *She* is taking out more student loans than me. *I'm* the one who bought the house. *She* spends more on clothes than me. You're not focused on the relationship as a partnership at all. You're keeping score. That doesn't bode well for a relationship.\n\nI see more evidence of this when you talk about finances in marriage and divorce. You're reluctant to be responsible for finances as a partner. You're concerned about keeping your stuff if you divorce. \n\nDo you see how all of your thoughts are really focused on yourself? There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it does cause problems when you're talking about future joint decisions and potentially children. Nothing at all is expressed as a partnership. I agree with you that you're not ready for marriage. However, I also think it's foolish for your girlfriend to think you will be a life partner because it seems obvious you aren't emotionally developed enough to have that kind of shared commitment for the rest of your life.\n\nLet me present an alternative viewpoint for you. My husband and I have been together for about twelve years, married for seven years. We have two children, 5 &amp; 3. We have a happy &amp; loving marriage. \n\nWhen we make our financial decisions, we make them as a team. For example, after our son was born, my husband wanted to finish his degree. He was (is) the sole breadwinner, so it made a lot of sense to make sure he had an education to earn more money. It was really tough for a couple of years, being a family of three, paying a mortgage, paying for his education, and he made $32k. Money was *tight,* but I worked hard with coupons and getting on programs like WIC, and we made it work. Our investment paid off, and he quickly moved up to a $45k salary around the time our second child was born. Last year, he accepted a new job with an even higher salary. So, he has been getting promotions and raises, and I'm proud of him. In a way, I suppose you could argue that I've sacrificed my own career up to this point. It's OK with me, though, because I see us as a team. We made the best decision for our family, each step of the way.\n\nAs I said, our youngest is 3 years old now. She turned 3 just last week! Our oldest started preschool this fall. It really got us thinking about how they'll both be in full time school in just a few years. We started planning for my return to the work force. So, I'm back in school now. I'm getting a teaching license. It's something I'm interested in doing, but it's also a good choice for our family because I will be able to be home around the time the kids are after school. We won't have to pay for after school care. I'll be able to be home for most of their vacations, so we won't have to worry about much summer care for them. I'll still be able to cook dinners. Basically, it'll allow me to have a good work/family balance that we value. The cost of my education is not nothing. We're taking on a *lot* of loans to invest in this future that we want for our family. My loans will probably equal a year's salary when I'm done. It seems stupid to take out so much in loans for a job that pays $40k. It's crazy that a job that takes so much education and skill doesn't pay much, but it's what I want to do and what we want for our family. Let me be clear: if I was a single parent or a divorced parent or whatever, I would *not* be making this financial decision. That would be stupid. We're making this decision based on the knowledge and belief that we're spending our lives together. Right now, we live on just his income. When I go back to work, we can put my entire salary toward my loan for a year and just get rid of it. So, I'm getting the education today based on my trust in our marriage. I sacrificed promotions and raises based on the trust in our marriage. My husband was willing to be the sole breadwinner--which comes with many of the risks you mentioned--based on the trust in our marriage. Does that make sense? If he came to me and talked about himself and his money and his finances and his savings and keeping finances separate and all of that bologna you mentioned, 1) I probably wouldn't have married him, and 2) I definitely wouldn't have been willing to stay home to raise our children and then go back to school. I would have stayed in my job, and who knows how we would have afforded day care. I guess one of us would have needed a second job. My point is that when you're establishing a lifelong partnership, *especially* if you are considering kids, you've got to be willing to think as a team and trust each other as equal partners. If you can't, then both of you will be looking out for only your own self-interest, and what is in the best interest of the partnership and family will fall by the wayside. In my opinion, *that* is why you are not ready to marry your girlfriend or have kids. You are thinking only of your own self-interest at this point, and you aren't mature enough yet to handle a spouse, partnership, or family.

It's OK with me, though, because I see us as a team. We made the best decision for our family, each step of the way.\n\nAs I said, our youngest is 3 years old now. She turned 3 just last week! Our oldest started preschool this fall. It really got us thinking about how they'll both be in full time school in just a few years. We started planning for my return to the work force. So, I'm back in school now. I'm getting a teaching license. It's something I'm interested in doing, but it's also a good choice for our family because I will be able to be home around the time the kids are after school. We won't have to pay for after school care. I'll be able to be home for most of their vacations, so we won't have to worry about much summer care for them. I'll still be able to cook dinners. Basically, it'll allow me to have a good work/family balance that we value. The cost of my education is not nothing. We're taking on a *lot* of loans to invest in this future that we want for our family. My loans will probably equal a year's salary when I'm done. It seems stupid to take out so much in loans for a job that pays $40k. It's crazy that a job that takes so much education and skill doesn't pay much, but it's what I want to do and what we want for our family. Let me be clear: if I was a single parent or a divorced parent or whatever, I would *not* be making this financial decision. That would be stupid. We're making this decision based on the knowledge and belief that we're spending our lives together. Right now, we live on just his income. When I go back to work, we can put my entire salary toward my loan for a year and just get rid of it. So, I'm getting the education today based on my trust in our marriage. I sacrificed promotions and raises based on the trust in our marriage. My husband was willing to be the sole breadwinner--which comes with many of the risks you mentioned--based on the trust in our marriage. Does that make sense? If he came to me and talked about himself and his money and his finances and his savings and keeping finances separate and all of that bologna you mentioned, 1) I probably wouldn't have married him, and 2) I definitely wouldn't have been willing to stay home to raise our children and then go back to school. I would have stayed in my job, and who knows how we would have afforded day care. I guess one of us would have needed a second job. My point is that when you're establishing a lifelong partnership, *especially* if you are considering kids, you've got to be willing to think as a team and trust each other as equal partners. If you can't, then both of you will be looking out for only your own self-interest, and what is in the best interest of the partnership and family will fall by the wayside. In my opinion, *that* is why you are not ready to marry your girlfriend or have kids. You are thinking only of your own self-interest at this point, and you aren't mature enough yet to handle a spouse, partnership, or family. I think you recognize that as well, which is certainly a good thing."}, {"id": "cm4tqz2", "body": "I didn't read all that, but skimmed it and think I get the gist of it.

IMO, it's just a social norm. If it works for you, that's great. Not everyone needs or wants it though.\n\nI think traditional marriage and divorce laws made more sense in the past when it was very difficult for women to make money and own things. The woman needed to be protected in case of a divorce so she wasn't left with nothing. Many modern couples are economic equals (or close enough), and these protections are not needed and can be unfair if one spouse chooses to save more than the other. Nothing wrong with a traditional stay-at-home wife and bread-winning husband, and in that case they probably should have combined finances and split everything in the case of divorce. But if a couple encourages economic equality and wants the freedom to do what they want with their own money, there is no reason to agree that everything should be split 50/50 if there is a divorce. \n\nTruth is, most people don't even think about this stuff when they get married. They just get married because they think that's what you do when you love someone. They probably learn about the legal stuff later, and just deal with it cause at that point they are already a legal entity with their spouse. Some people are probably aware of the legal stuff beforehand and are fine with it. If that's the path you choose that's fine.

She is my best friend as well as my lover, and we do almost everything together. I don't want to marry her because I don't like the marriage and divorce laws regarding assets and debts. I see minimal benefit to a legal marriage, but a big risk if we don't work out as life partners. She is happy with how things are, but I think she would like it a bit if we were \"official\".\n\nI'm a little older than her, I have a good paying professional job, own the house we live in, and have some money invested in stocks. I invest a large chunk of my pay. I know what is mine before marriage would stay mine, but I am planning to continue to pay off my mortgage and invest a lot of my income. She is still in school, working on becoming a high-paid professional too. She will likely take out more student loans in the years to come. I am pretty certain she will continue to spend a lot more money than me on things like lattes and clothes. I am totally fine with this, but if we shared finances I would feel like she was buying stuff I don't care about with \"our\" money, and the money I was saving would also become \"ours\". I don't want to get married and pretend our finances are separate, knowing that if we get divorced the courts will split everything 50/50 (I live in a community property state, meaning assets and debts acquired during marriage are joint). I also don't want to do a pre-nup. To make it legit, both of us would need attorneys during the process, which is expensive. We already live like we are married, it seems silly to get the marriage certificate, and do more paper work to undo a big chunk of what the marriage certificate does. I'm also concerned that she would not like the pre-nup process, and it might make getting married not as fun.\n\nI am pretty certain I will accumulate wealth much faster than she. I want to share this wealth with her while we are together, but if for some reason we don't work out I want to keep what I have worked hard to earn, and not be responsible for any debts she may still have. Many times the lower earning person helps the higher earner to make more money. This is not the case with us, we split all the housework and stuff evenly. I'd be wealthier if I were single (mainly because I'd get roommates and charge them rent), but I have no complaints because I love living with my girl and spending some money so we can have a blast. On the flip side, I am pretty sure she will be wealthier with me than if single or with someone else. I know a lot about personal finance, I give her as much advice as she will tolerate (haha), and will encourage her to practice good financial habits and establish financial security of her own.\n\nWe don't have kids, but if we do we will figure out a fair way to divide labor, because we are both intelligent and can work out a good deal for both of us. If we think it is best for her to take some time off to be a SAHM, I am confident we will figure out a fair deal, including some compensation for missed career building. Or, maybe she'll SAH the first few years, and I'll SAH the next few years.\n\nI think the reason we have these divorce laws is because most people don't plan ahead for things. Divorce law is a crappy one-size-fits-all way to handle the problem, better than nothing but it still sucks. I have no problem publicly committing my love to the woman I want to spend my life with, but will not go along with the government dictating how we handle our finances. I don't want to get married, ever.\n\n*Edit: I have talked to her about all this. I also want to hear other opinions. Thanks!*\n\n*Edit 2: Her view on marriage changes a lot. Sometimes she thinks the whole thing is stupid and we should never get married, but sometimes she'll ask me if I want to. I think the rational side of her thinks it's dumb, but the emotional side of her feels kinda left out by not being married.*\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

My personal opinion is to have taxpayer funded rehab that's free to any citizen. You of course have to take it seriously or get kicked out and I would have the patients contribute as much work as they can to the facility without it impacting their treatment. Don't make it look like an us vs you thing. We need to remove the stigma from being a drug addict so they're free to admit how fucked up they are and go to treatment. And for those who want to get all tea party about tax payers footing the bill when it's their own fault they're addicts, the amount we'd save by treating them and getting them back into society is cheaper than housing them in prisons or having them live on the streets.

You can put them through detox to get them safely past their withdrawals, but that doesn't cure their craving or addiction behavior. You can lock them up for a month or two in treatment, tell them drugs are bad, talk about better strategies, get them a job, temporary housing, give them medicine and therapy, and send them on their way, but in they end they have to be the one to stay sober. There's no point to rehabilitation if you can't eventually trust them to make their own decisions. That said, the lifetime prevalency for relapse after treatment is as high as 90%, depending on a number of factors. As you mention, getting someone into a new environment is critically important to recovery, but it's not always enough. Permanently cutting ties with your family and  friends, being unemployed and impoverished, and struggling with mental illness all increase likelihood of relapse and are not easily overcome. Even for someone who is well adjusted and healthy, that sort of isolation is torturous. The more intrinsic motivation a client has to recover (self admitted instead of forced) the greater their likelihood of success. Similarly, having a strong support network like sober family, friends, or  NA/AA is strongly predictive of more successful sobriety. It's not rocket science.

They use drugs or alcohol to try to regain some control over their lives, and they themselves are often the greatest victims of their actions. They destroy their relationships, their reputations, their careers, and have their freedom taken away when they hurt others. The solution to this problem is not to take from them further, but to give them a standard to live up to. If you treat addicts as second class citizens, they act like second class citizens.

Sorry for any assumptions about your position on my end.\n\nThere are a number of ways that someone can enter treatment outside of being arrested, though most of my mandated clients were attending after an arrest. For example, someone could be pressured to attend treatment by their employer, or as part of a custody settlement. Other outside pressures could include an intervention by family or even a doctor.\n\nRegarding diagnosis, there's a lot to consider. First of all, there are different classifications under the umbrella of \"substance use disorders.\" Substance use generally is considered a disorder when it causes disruption in main areas of a person's life. Substance Dependence (eg Alcohol Dependence) refers to a reliance on, or increased tolerance for a given substance. This includes physical withdrawals, using substances to cope with daily life, and increased tolerance. Substance Abuse is when the substance use is excessive, or generally interferes with life areas. Substance Intoxication is a single instance of use to the point of impairment. Obviously, these diagnoses can overlap. Substance dependence is what most people think of when they say addiction, but substance abuse is also quite disruptive. Intoxication is pretty limited in terms of time span, and is only usually used in like hospital settings. Variation in reports of how much the client uses a substance, the negative effects on their life, and other contextual factors contribute to the \"grey area\" I spoke of. If a client gets into a car crash, blows a 0.20%,and is convicted of a DUI, you have a pretty good idea they have a substance use disorder. This gets more complicated when they claim it was a one time thing, and they usually don't have a drinking problem. The same goes for people arrested for possession. Simply having drugs doesn't make someone an addict. \n\nI think that you're right in that more should be done to provide long term care to addicts, as many people view it as a lifelong condition. You can be in remission for years, but the threat of relapse is still there. The problem is that there are also some addicts who after treatment can still use other substances.  One recovered heroin addict might be able to smoke pot, or drink alcohol (both legal in some states) without consequences, but another recovering addict would spiral out of control after their first beer. Because there is so much variation in recovery, imposing a one-size-fits-all law would be unfair. Also, a single check in really is limited by whether the client self reports. Parole already serves this purpose for clients who go through drug court, and parole eventually ends for a very good reason. Keeping someone under surveillance for their entire life is extremely intrusive, expensive, and I don't see a huge benefit. Your analogy with see offenders is accurate based on recidivism, but sex crimes are far more antisocial than drug use."}, {"id": "2m88ju", "body": "I recognize that this goes against their right to freedom.

This might be o.k., if you had absolutely no other evidence from which do draw, understood the very substantially errors that are introduced by this method, and the decisions made by use of this method had few ethical or tangible consequences. However, this isn't how medical treatment models are derived--they are based upon (well, they are supposed to be based upon) evidence derived through statistical analysis.\n\n&gt;The last and largest portion of your comment is a bit confusing to me.

Given the condition of addiction treatment in the U.S., almost all of the people in the group that received treatment would have voluntarily sought it out. The data indicates that people that received treatment actually had remission rates *lower* than the untreated group. In \"layman's\" terms, this means that, on average, people who received treatment for addiction had ***worse*** outcomes than people that were left untreated. Now, all the study that I linked to shows is lower remission rates among the treated group, but the study wasn't designed to evaluate the significance of this disparity. However, you can search Google and find a few, better controlled studies that demonstrate a similar relationship. Again, while the research isn't conclusive, it shows a trend that demonstrates addiction treatment--**at best**--is *slightly* more effective than not treating people at all.

I was merely pointing out that the potential for death is not necessarily a deterrent (which is one of the arguments against the death penalty), and that the potential for death might actually incite someone to use escalated force when they would have been satisfied with a punch or two."}, {"id": "2m82fm", "body": "When defending yourself you can't know if doing something to your attacker will result in their death.

Murder requires premeditation.  A prosecutor would have to prove you intended to kill that person before they initiated any aggression towards you.\n\nThe standard of self defense that is used in the law is pretty flexible.  It accounts for the exact situation you were in and looks to see if a reasonable person would think that a danger to life or limb existed.  I'm going to quote [NY's self defense law](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article35.htm), tell me if you disagree:\n\n&gt; [C]onduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when:... Such conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a situation occasioned or developed through no fault of the actor, and which is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding such injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue."}, {"id": "2m82fm", "body": "When defending yourself you can't know if doing something to your attacker will result in their death.
