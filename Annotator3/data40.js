He purposefully violated his contract to make money off of Monsanto's work without paying them for their part.\n\nFrom your link:\n\n&gt;The issues of patent infringement and \"farmer's rights\" were settled, in Monsanto's favour, at the trial before the Federal Court of Canada[4] and upheld at the appeal level before the Federal Court of Appeal. Both courts found that a key element in Mr. Schmeiser's patent infringement in his 1998 crop was that he knew or ought to have known the nature of the gylphosate-resistant seed he saved and planted.\n\n&gt;The case was initially tried on June 5, 2000, in the Federal Court of Canada, at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.[8]\n\n&gt;All claims relating to Roundup Ready canola in Schmeiser's 1997 canola crop were dropped prior to trial and the court only considered the canola in Schmeiser's 1998 fields. Regarding his 1998 crop, Schmeiser did not put forward any defence of accidental contamination. The evidence showed that the level of Roundup Ready canola in Mr. Schmeiser's 1998 fields was 95-98% (See paragraph 53 of the trial ruling[4]). Evidence was presented indicating that such a level of purity could not occur by accidental means. On the basis of this the court found that Schmeiser had either known \"or ought to have known\" that he had planted Roundup Ready canola in 1998. Given this, the question of whether the canola in his fields in 1997 arrived there accidentally was ruled to be irrelevant. Nonetheless, at trial, Monsanto was able to present evidence sufficient to persuade the Court that Roundup Ready canola had probably not appeared in Schmeiser's 1997 field by such accidental means (paragraph 118[4]). The court said it was persuaded \"on the balance of probabilities\" (the standard of proof in civil cases, meaning \"more probable than not\" i.e. strictly greater than 50% probability) that the Roundup Ready canola in Mr. Schmeiser's 1997 field had not arrived there by any of the accidental means, such as spillage from a truck or pollen travelling on the wind, that Mr. Schmeiser had proposed.\n\n&gt;In the public arena, Schmeiser supporters argued that his account still leaves open the possibility that the harvesting and replanting of Roundup Ready canola from the sprayed region was accidental and resulted from a miscommunication between Schmeiser and his farmhand, or from a failure of Schmeiser to have the presence of mind to instruct his farmhand to avoid taking canola seed for replanting from the sprayed region. Supporters of Monsanto argued that an oversight of this nature is not plausible, especially in light of Schmeiser's claims regarding the extent to which he considered Roundup Ready canola undesirable in his fields and the importance he claims to have placed on the continued survival of his own strain of canola, and in light of his having been notified prior to planting his 1998 crop that Monsanto believed he had grown Roundup Ready canola in 1997. Legally, an oversight of this nature is not a defence against patent infringement, and was therefore irrelevant. Patents are civil law, and the presence or absence of \"guilty intent\" is not a factor in determining patent infringement.[4]:Para 115 On this point, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that in the case of accidental genetic contamination of a crop beyond a farmer's control should be an exception to the rule that intent is not an issue in patent disputes.\n\n&gt;The Court's ruling concluded:\n\n&gt;&gt;... on the balance of probabilities, the defendants infringed a number of the claims under the plaintiffs\u2019 Canadian patent number 1,313,830 by planting, in 1998, without leave or licence by the plaintiffs, canola fields with seed saved from the 1997 crop which seed was known, or ought to have been known by the defendants to be Roundup tolerant and when tested was found to contain the gene and cells claimed under the plaintiffs\u2019 patent. By selling the seed harvested in 1998 the defendants further infringed the plaintiffs\u2019 patent.\"[4]\n\n&gt;The case was then heard by the Federal Court of Appeal at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, beginning May 15, 2002. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the ruling of the trial judge.[9]\n\n&gt;The Federal Court of Appeal in particular stressed the importance of the finding that Schmeiser had knowingly used the seed, in their decision to find Schmeiser in infringement of the patent, and noted that in a case of accidental contamination or a case where the farmer knew of the presence of the gene but took no action to increase its prevalence in his crop, a different ruling could be possible (see paragraphs 55-58 of the appeal ruling[9]). No damages were assessed against Percy Schmeiser, the private individual. Only Mr. Schmeiser's farming corporation, Schmeiser Enterprises Ltd., was held liable, as Mr. Schmeiser had acted in his capacity as director of the corporation.\n\n&gt;**The Court ruled that Schmeiser deprived Monsanto of its monopoly on the special canola plant by storing and planting the Roundup Ready canola seeds pursuant to his commercial interests. Thus, Schmeiser is considered to have infringed section 42 of the Patent Act.**\n\n&gt;Also, if you want papers, take a look at this one[1] , discussing Monsanto's intention of messing with the conditions of both their own research and the research conducted about them, from the Pacific Ecologist.

"}, {"id": "cm4ja1q", "body": "As you have pointed out, trying to argue the perimeter of \"who has produced more work\" is not an apt way of decide whether one is better than the other. Quantity does not indicate quality (I could write thousands of poems a year, but that has no indication on whether I am a good poet). Elizabeth Bishop, a highly influential poet of the 20th Century, was not prolific in the least. She took great care to craft poems (writing two to three a year), and she is perhaps the most celebrated female poet in the 1900's.\n\nCovering a wide variety of topics does not indicate quality either. Pablo Neruda wrote most often about love: he has countless poems on the subject alone. Using one main subject is not a deterrent if the writer can write well on that subject.\n\nYou also have to consider influence and history. I highly doubt \"1 in a 100\" English speakers know Shakespeare. He is taught in every high school and college, he in unavoidable. His language has also affected us (he invented words like \"zany,\" \"majestic,\" \"gnarled\" and phrases such as \"the mind's eye,\" \"full circle,\" \"heart of gold,\" and \"wild goose chase\") and his plots have been reused countless times (Taming of the Shrew, Macbeth, and Hamlet to name a few, not to mention Romeo and Juliet).\n\nSprog has also not been around enough to stand the test of time.

You say you cheer for the team with the cooler mascot, prettier colors or logo. Is that not just as arbitrary, if not more so, than the origin of a team? If you think about it, especially at the college and professional level, the town that a team is affiliated with has nothing to do with the players; most of them are probably from other cities, states, or even countries. So cheering for the home team, as opposed to the away team, is often just an arbitrary selection process. You could cheer for any team, so why not cheer for the team that's closer to where you live? But you may prefer to cheer for the time that you support morally, or whose players you think play better or with more style. That is less arbitrary, but it requires some knowledge of the game that many people don't have and aren't willing to invest the time to acquire.   \nNow to the issue of countries, states, and other political affiliations. What this has to do with, mainly, is not the symbols of a country per se. That is, being a patriot does not (or should not) mean loving red, white, and blue, eagles, and the US government. What patriotism is mainly about is the people that reside within a country. I don't love America necessarily, but I do love my neighbors and friends, at least moreso than I do strangers, and almost all of my friends live in America or are American citizens. So being a patriot is not about putting down the citizens of other countries; they are all people, and I'm sure they are nice and good for the most part. Being a patriot is about being in favor of the people I know and love.   \n  Admittedly, I don't know everyone in America. I know many people in my town, and so I'm in favor of that town over others. What's good for my state is usually good for my town, and what's good for my country is usually good for my state, so patriotism is really just an extended love of my neighbors and friends. We can go further too: what's good for North American countries is probably good for the USA, and what's good for the world is good for North America, so I have a love for these things too. In other words, you can be proud to be a part of any group that includes you, from the smallest to the largest.   \n  On a side note, nationalism is also a way of driving people to success. Doing something for yourself is nice, but doing something to benefit your country is better. That may not work for you, but much of the competition that led to the inventions and discoveries that brought about the first-world luxury you now reside in was a direct result of nationalism. A good example of this is NASA and the Space Race, which led to dozens of technological advancements.   \nA final point I would add is that you, as a member of your country, can have a direct influence on what your country is. This is especially true because you live in America, where voting is such an integral part of our government. You cannot control the laws in Canada or in Europe, and you especially can't control laws in places like North Korea with oppressive regimes. For that reason alone, you should support your country as a representation of your own values. If you don't feel like American society or laws reflect you as a citizen, then you can and should work to change them. If that fails, you can move to another country that does reflect your values, and be proud to be an adopted German or Japanese citizen or what have you.  \nPatriotism is often twisted to become something it isn't, a hatred of foreigners, immigrants, and \"others\". I cannot speak for or defend such practices, and you are right in questioning those that do. I can only hope that you understand the importance of supporting the country of which you are a citizen.   \n\nTL; DR: Your country is shaped by you, and is made up of the people you know. You can change the world of which you are a citizen by changing the country, the state, and the town of which you are a citizen.

Like, a lot of national pride is kept alive through celebrations of national history (4th of July, Guy Fawkes' Day, Bastille Day), when a nation is reminded of times when they made significant decisions *as a nation* that made them what they are today. Similarly, people take pride in their high school team because these are men and women from their community who are trying to achieve something good, and that reflects on the community. Pride is a way of showing loyalty to the community you come from, recognizing them as an important aspect of your life. \n\nMost importantly, you're not going to erase the prejudices ingrained in you by your upbringing by denying your upbringing. We owe a large chunk of our personal identity to our family, our neighborhood, our school, our country. What you do on the weekend, the books you read, the people you're friends with and the careers you choose are all influenced by where you're from. That's why culture shock happens. You may not be proud of where you come from, but like it or not, where you come from has an influence on who you are, which basically means that, because you come from x, you are radically different, in ways ranging from negligible to huge, from all people who come from (not x). \n\nBut you don't have to be a nationalist, jingoist, or xenophobe, nor are Gryffindor and Slytherin representative of the typical school \"rivalry\".

Being Proud of your roots is totally fine.\n\n2. Patriotism for your country is okay... but be careful it does not lead to...\n\n3. Nationalism and Jingoism, which often promotes a blind devotion to your country, and a belief that it is superior to other countries.

I think there is nothing wrong with being proud to be an American, or a Wisconsinite, or a Milkwakeean. \n\nTo a lesser degree, I also understand Patriotism. I think there is a fair number of disagreement on what Patriotism is though. At least in the USA, there seems to be some people who believe patriotism should be shouted from rooftops, and those who believe it should be mostly be kept to yourself.\n\nBut is is very much a problem when you go from being proud to feeling superior.

That something wouldn't happen in the States that can happen in Canada is not an argument that America's Bill or Rights is superior, it's just noting a difference. Whether that difference is good or bad is a separate issue.\n\n&gt;But my principal objection is that the effect of the decision is to ban political pamphlets. That's facially repugnant to me.\n\nIt banned **a** political pamphlet, and more broadly it banned the publication of political pamphlets that promotes hatred towards disadvantaged groups. The argument here is that that's a relatively small infringement banning a specific type of speech. The idea that any infringement is abhorrent rests on either the notion that it will lead to desirable speech being prohibited (which is a hard argument given the criteria of reasonableness for limiting it), or that it's just inherently wrong in itself, which is also kind of hard to argue for.\n\n&gt;I don't agree that it is pressing or substantial. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to have a position on how individuals within society should think of each other.\n\nExcept that part of governments role is to protect individuals from harm. That requires that it takes positions on \"how individuals within society should think of each other\". If hate speech presents a danger to a specific group of people then it is reasonable to allow government some authority to curtail it. Just like it's reasonable for government to enact \"sin taxes\" on specific items that are harmful, like cigarettes or alcohol. \n\n&gt;Ok, and? Lots of things have societal impacts. It doesn't mean the government has a legitimate interest in crafting societal opinions one way or another.\n\nAs I stated above, government does have a legitimate interest in curbing violence or discriminatory practices towards groups of people. If that is realized through hate speech laws, then it's arguably legitimate. Personally, I think that there are communal \n\n&gt;This is a horrible slippery slope argument. All of the above are banned by Canadian law, and if the court's argument is that the current law must prevent the rise of political opinions which could change future law, that's repugnant to democratic ideas.\n\nSlippery slope arguments aren't automatically wrong or fallacious. But more to the point, most absolutist free speech arguments actually are slippery slope arguments themselves. I mean, the basic fear is that curbing *any kind of political speech* is bad because it has the potential to be misused, and as such we ought to allow any form of it unless it directly causes harm. But the structure of that argument is eerily similar to arguments in favor of prohibiting hate speech - namely that it leads to problems down the road. \n\n&gt;I don't see how this follows, unless they're also worried about getting dragged in front of a human rights tribunal.\n\nIf certain speech limits other forms of speech than it's apparent that it creates a barrier. Gay people who live in overwhelmingly conservative areas where they feel marginalized, discriminated against, or where disclosing their sexuality presents barriers that otherwise wouldn't be there is limiting their speech in a very real and tangible way. Hate speech can lead to environments in which people don't feel free to express themselves. It's not just about being \"worried about getting dragged in front of a human rights tribunal\", it's about a greater societal effect. If being gay limits your ability to participate in government - like you wouldn't be able to get elected *because* you're gay - that's discriminatory. \n\n&gt;The court asserts that allowing hate speech to go unrestrained can lead to huge problems down the road. I am unpersuaded that this is actually the case. As you admit, the connection is not direct, and it's a really big deal to restrict core political speech based on an indirect, and I think specious, case.\n\nI readily admit that the connection is not direct, and to be honest I'm generally more on the side of freer speech than placing limitations on it in virtually all cases, but I also recognize that there's also room for a reasonable limitation in the effort to create a more tolerant society. To use an analog of how speech allows bad ideas to remain, the reason why creationism is still a huge topic in the States is because it's still spoken about. In other words, the reason why people think that creationism is a viable hypothesis is because it's an idea that's espoused by many, many people as being \"right\" which creates an environment in which it's okay to believe in it. One has only to look at violent attacks perpetrated against LGBTs, or them being thrown out of their houses as teenagers, or whatever else to realize that part of that has to do with allowing an environment in which LGBT people are demonized and dehumanized. \n\n&gt;My counterpoint is that if you actually want to protect minorities, you should protect their civil rights with a rights document that's worth a damn and provides everyone, minorities included, with clear, irrevocable, and meaningful rights against government discrimination. Since basically the entire list of purported evils the Supreme Court gives are government actions, this would seem to be much more effective than trying to massage public opinion via banning political pamphlets.\n\nRights are complicated things, and it's almost a certainty that rights will come into conflict with each other at some point.

That's facially repugnant to me.\n\nIt banned **a** political pamphlet, and more broadly it banned the publication of political pamphlets that promotes hatred towards disadvantaged groups. The argument here is that that's a relatively small infringement banning a specific type of speech. The idea that any infringement is abhorrent rests on either the notion that it will lead to desirable speech being prohibited (which is a hard argument given the criteria of reasonableness for limiting it), or that it's just inherently wrong in itself, which is also kind of hard to argue for.\n\n&gt;I don't agree that it is pressing or substantial. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to have a position on how individuals within society should think of each other.\n\nExcept that part of governments role is to protect individuals from harm. That requires that it takes positions on \"how individuals within society should think of each other\". If hate speech presents a danger to a specific group of people then it is reasonable to allow government some authority to curtail it. Just like it's reasonable for government to enact \"sin taxes\" on specific items that are harmful, like cigarettes or alcohol. \n\n&gt;Ok, and? Lots of things have societal impacts. It doesn't mean the government has a legitimate interest in crafting societal opinions one way or another.\n\nAs I stated above, government does have a legitimate interest in curbing violence or discriminatory practices towards groups of people. If that is realized through hate speech laws, then it's arguably legitimate. Personally, I think that there are communal \n\n&gt;This is a horrible slippery slope argument. All of the above are banned by Canadian law, and if the court's argument is that the current law must prevent the rise of political opinions which could change future law, that's repugnant to democratic ideas.\n\nSlippery slope arguments aren't automatically wrong or fallacious. But more to the point, most absolutist free speech arguments actually are slippery slope arguments themselves. I mean, the basic fear is that curbing *any kind of political speech* is bad because it has the potential to be misused, and as such we ought to allow any form of it unless it directly causes harm. But the structure of that argument is eerily similar to arguments in favor of prohibiting hate speech - namely that it leads to problems down the road. \n\n&gt;I don't see how this follows, unless they're also worried about getting dragged in front of a human rights tribunal.\n\nIf certain speech limits other forms of speech than it's apparent that it creates a barrier. Gay people who live in overwhelmingly conservative areas where they feel marginalized, discriminated against, or where disclosing their sexuality presents barriers that otherwise wouldn't be there is limiting their speech in a very real and tangible way. Hate speech can lead to environments in which people don't feel free to express themselves. It's not just about being \"worried about getting dragged in front of a human rights tribunal\", it's about a greater societal effect. If being gay limits your ability to participate in government - like you wouldn't be able to get elected *because* you're gay - that's discriminatory. \n\n&gt;The court asserts that allowing hate speech to go unrestrained can lead to huge problems down the road. I am unpersuaded that this is actually the case. As you admit, the connection is not direct, and it's a really big deal to restrict core political speech based on an indirect, and I think specious, case.\n\nI readily admit that the connection is not direct, and to be honest I'm generally more on the side of freer speech than placing limitations on it in virtually all cases, but I also recognize that there's also room for a reasonable limitation in the effort to create a more tolerant society. To use an analog of how speech allows bad ideas to remain, the reason why creationism is still a huge topic in the States is because it's still spoken about. In other words, the reason why people think that creationism is a viable hypothesis is because it's an idea that's espoused by many, many people as being \"right\" which creates an environment in which it's okay to believe in it. One has only to look at violent attacks perpetrated against LGBTs, or them being thrown out of their houses as teenagers, or whatever else to realize that part of that has to do with allowing an environment in which LGBT people are demonized and dehumanized. \n\n&gt;My counterpoint is that if you actually want to protect minorities, you should protect their civil rights with a rights document that's worth a damn and provides everyone, minorities included, with clear, irrevocable, and meaningful rights against government discrimination. Since basically the entire list of purported evils the Supreme Court gives are government actions, this would seem to be much more effective than trying to massage public opinion via banning political pamphlets.\n\nRights are complicated things, and it's almost a certainty that rights will come into conflict with each other at some point. Freedom of expression will conflict with the security of person, etc. I don't think it's as cut-and-dry as you're making it out to be."}, {"id": "cm4iydw", "body": "&gt;I actually disagree. I think the main strength of the Charter and why is supersedes the Bill of Rights. In fact, I'd say that s. 1 allows government and the judiciary the latitude to strike a balance between individual rights and societal well-being/initiatives.\n\nI think that latitude is dangerous and can have a powerful chilling effect on the exercise of rights, even when the courts are allowing some speech.  The farce of the Maclean's case before the BC Human Rights Tribunal would be my example as to the chilling effect.\n\n&gt;Sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's more desirable. Maybe I'm missing it, but I'm not seeing an argument here so much as a statement that America and Canada have differences regarding how each country views rights. That something wouldn't happen in the States that can happen in Canada is not an argument that America's Bill or Rights is superior, it's just noting a difference. Whether that difference is good or bad is a separate issue.\n\nThe argument is that it seems to work out OK for the United States.  There is a cohesive body of law that allows for this sort of speech, and while you do get those few assholes who protest funerals or whatever, they mostly get ignored or mocked, without major harm to society.\n\n&gt;The argument here is that that's a relatively small infringement banning a specific type of speech.\n\nI just don't think it's a small infringement though.  There is a lot of speech which would meet this test, much of which is really important political speech.  E.g. an anti-abortion protester could be seen as promoting hatred towards women.  But the question of abortion law is a legitimate one to be raised in political discourse.  And I think the use of such a law in that respect (which is totally on the table under the *Whatcott* precedent) could have a powerful chilling effect on that political speech.\n\n&gt;The idea that any infringement is abhorrent rests on either the notion that it will lead to desirable speech being prohibited (which is a hard argument given the criteria of reasonableness for limiting it), or that it's just inherently wrong in itself, which is also kind of hard to argue for.\n\nAs to the philosophical question of why undesirable speech should be allowed, I think that the 19th century philosopher John Stuart Mill makes an excellent argument for it in his long essay [*On Liberty*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty)  Quoting a little:\n\n&gt;First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility. Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied. Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.\n\nI think none of those four arguments depend on a slippery slope.\n\n&gt;Slippery slope arguments aren't automatically wrong or fallacious. \n\nI said it was a bad slippery slope argument.  It does not logically follow that the parade of horribles is any more or less likely to come about as a result of the Human Rights Code provisions in question.  And putting genocide in there is just absurd.  There is no plausible connection between the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and the potential of a Canadian genocide.  \n\n&gt; But more to the point, most absolutist free speech arguments actually are slippery slope arguments themselves. I mean, the basic fear is that curbing any kind of political speech is bad because it has the potential to be misused, and as such we ought to allow any form of it unless it directly causes harm.\n\nMy argument for the absolutist perpsective is that curbing political speech is itself misuse.  Firstly, Mr. Whatcott suffered direct damages (a fine IIRC) as a result of this, which is itself a negative consequence.  And his ongoing rights are curtailed.  That restriction on liberty is a direct negative consequence which I don't like one bit.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, the government is an instrument of the people, and not the other way around.  It is not for the government to say what views its citizens hold, but rather to let its citizens inform its policies within the framework of law and peaceful order.  Mr. Whatcott's speech, repugnant as it was, was a bona fide attempt to participate in government, and it is an abuse for the government to sanction him for participating in a way that it doesn't like.  \n\n&gt;I readily admit that the connection is not direct, and to be honest I'm generally more on the side of freer speech than placing limitations on it in virtually all cases, but I also recognize that there's also room for a reasonable limitation in the effort to create a more tolerant society.  To use an analog of how speech allows bad ideas to remain, the reason why creationism is still a huge topic in the States is because it's still spoken about. In other words, the reason why people think that creationism is a viable hypothesis is because it's an idea that's espoused by many, many people as being \"right\" which creates an environment in which it's okay to believe in it.\n\nBut for this to make sense, you would need to be using the Human Rights Code to ban views that are widely prevalent.  In the first instance that seems more problematic since it involves curtailing the speech of a whole lot of people, possibly almost everyone.  For example I believe Scientology to be a cult which preys upon and exploits people, and that anyone who willingly joins Scientology is deeply immoral.  But that's exactly the sort of statement that would be able to be tried before a human rights tribunal.  *Note to anyone reading this who works for a Human Rights Tribunal in Canada: I'm posting from the United States, so go buzz off.*\n\nAnd in the creationism case, we're talking about people's genuinely and by all accounts deeply held religious beliefs.  Heck, in Whatcott's case, it's a genuinely and deeply held religious belief.  I'm not religious, but I am **really** not ok with the government saying that people's genuinely held religious beliefs can't be expressed.  I mean, if you read the Bible or the Qu'ran or whatever, they express hatred and contempt for other religions and people.  Is someone who says they believe the Bible to be the absolute and true word of God and that all nonbelievers are heathens to be punished by the government?\n\n&gt; One has only to look at violent attacks perpetrated against LGBTs, or them being thrown out of their houses as teenagers, or whatever else to realize that part of that has to do with allowing an environment in which LGBT people are demonized and dehumanized.\n\nBut do these laws fix that?  I mean, those violent attacks are crimes with or without these laws.  As a gay man who has lived in the US for a long time, I haven't had those problems in a country lacking in hate speech laws.\n\n&gt;If being gay limits your ability to participate in government - like you wouldn't be able to get elected because you're gay - that's discriminatory.\n\nThat particular instance of discrimination is one I vehemently object to the government intervening into.  The government should not **ever** be using social policy to tell its citizens who to vote for.  The idea that a thumb should be put on the scale to help some candidates over others is repugnant to democracy.  The people have the right to vote for whoever they want for whatever reason they want, full stop.\n\n&gt;Rights are complicated things, and it's almost a certainty that rights will come into conflict with each other at some point. Freedom of expression will conflict with the security of person, etc. I don't think it's as cut-and-dry as you're making it out to be.\n\nRights are complicated, but it's not like a cohesive view of them that excludes hate speech laws is unworkable.  It exists and works in the United States.  \n\nAnd I still see no cohesive case that the restrictions on speech in *Whatcott* are in any way tied to the security of any persons, especially when the criminal code is quite capable of handing down harsh punishment for violent criminals, whatever their motive.  "}, {"id": "cm4bdmn", "body": "First, a badly and loosely worded law on the books is a problem in itself under what's known (in the US and Canada) as the [\"chilling effect\" doctrine.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)  The threat of having to go to court (or a quasi court like the BC Human Rights Tribunal - and don't get me started on that) and defend your speech against accusations under a vague law may make you less likely to speak at all.  So I don't grant your implied premise that it's no big deal if it's not enforced too badly.\n\nBut you asked for examples, and examples I shall provide.\n\nOne that made very big news in Canada about 6 years back related to [a complaint about an article in *Maclean's* magazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_complaints_against_Maclean's_magazine) which was claimed to be derogatory of Muslims.  The tribunal ultimately found Maclean's not responsible, but I would say the circus that the \"trial\" comprised actually ended up having exactly the sort of chilling effect that I'm talking about.  Maclean's spent probably hundreds of thousands of dollars defending the case.  If I work for say *The Globe and Mail*, and I wanted to run a similar piece, my editors might think twice on fear of having to go to court about it.\n\nAnother prominent example comes from a very similar Saskatchewan law, Sec. [14(1)(b) of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code](http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/S24-1.pdf). (PDF warning)  The statute reads as follows:\n\n&gt;14(1) No person shall publish or display, or cause or permit to be published ordisplayed, on any lands or premises or in a newspaper, through a television or radio broadcasting station or any other broadcasting device, or in any printed matter or publication or by means of any other medium that the person owns, controls, distributes or sells, any representation, including any notice, sign, symbol, emblem, article, statement or other representation...\n\n&gt;(b) that exposes or tends to expose to hatred, ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of any person or class of persons on the basis of a prohibited ground.\n\nVery recently, [the Supreme Court of Canada ruled](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/12876/index.do) on a case brought under that section of the Code against a man named William Whatcott.\n\nIn that ruling, they allowed the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal's judgment against Mr. Whatcott.  His offense, as described by the Supreme Court:\n\n&gt;  In 2001 and 2002, Mr. Whatcott distributed four flyers in Regina and Saskatoon on behalf of the Christian Truth Activists. Two of the flyers, marked as exhibits D and E at the Tribunal hearing, were entitled \u201cKeep Homosexuality out of Saskatoon\u2019s Public Schools!\u201d (\u201cFlyer D\u201d) and \u201cSodomites in our Public Schools\u201d (\u201cFlyer E\u201d), respectively. The other two flyers, marked as exhibits F and G, were identical, and were a reprint of a page of classified advertisements to which handwritten comments were added (\u201cFlyer F\u201d and \u201cFlyer G\u201d). The flyers are reproduced in Appendix B.\n\nThe hate speech law here was applied (and affirmed by the courts) **to ban the publication of political pamphlets.**  Now, I think Whatcott is an asshole, and disagree with him vehemently.

Knowing that was a no-go, they tried to make it a presumptive crime, and make the defendant prove himself innocent.  But you can't do that.

Karen Gillan is a goddess.*\n\n&gt; Sure, the government can run ads about equality, but the instigator will have that in mind and will tell his followers the government is lying/wrong.&gt; \n\nI think my biggest fear is that hate speech will be used any time someone says the government is wrong. If government can link a policy with the benefit of any one group and hate speech laws become liberally enforced, then any criticism of a policy could be linked with criticism of a group.\n\nYour next example also uses threats of violence as an example. I should have been clear in the description, but I more mean the expression of distaste or hate for a group without being combined with threats of violence.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed hate speech in public contexts. You can carry signs that say \"God hates fags\" at funerals, no problem, thanks to the Supreme Court. In 1996 a bunch of white supremacists burned a cross on a black family's lawn and Minnesota charged them with a hate speech crime. Scalia wrote the majority opinion that struck down the ordinance, claiming that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was concerned with the content and not the mode of expression. He then suggested that burning of crosses could still be illegal for other reasons--arson or property damage laws, for example. But it couldn't be an illegal act *just* because it was an expression of hate.\n\nFighting words are a different matter, and one that the Supreme Court has limited free speech for. The court continually narrows the definition of \"fighting words\"--they cannot merely be offensive, they must add up to personal abuse designed to incite the person being abused to violence.  But the Supreme Court ruled in a case where these were the fighting words under scrutiny:\n\n\"White son of a bitch, I'll kill you. You son of a bitch, I'll choke you to death. You son of a bitch, if you ever put your hands on me again, I'll cut you all to pieces.\"\n\nThe court ruled that these were *not* fighting words. Well, if these aren't fighting words, then it would be difficult to imagine the Supreme Court *ever* defining *any* speech as fighting words. In another case, they ruled that \"We'll take the fucking street later\" were not fighting words either. I mean, basically, in America, you can say/write just about anything you want and the content of your speech shouldn't result in your arrest. Even defamation via libel/slander isn't a federal crime. If you're arrested because of a state or local statute and you follow it up through the court system, the Supremes or the lower courts are likely to rule in favor of free speech. The Westboro Baptist Church decision was 8-1. That's a pretty strong commitment to allowing hate speech.\n\nNote that free speech does not protect you from consequences, of course. There are certain contexts in which speech is limited and it is legal because, say, getting fired is not government oppression of free speech."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2mhg29", "body": "I won't say my name, but because of slavery, it is extremely common and unoriginal. it doesn't help that I have a fairly common first name.\nI feel extremely frustrated that I have the last name of someone who would mistreat my ancestors and make them work for no pay.

Now I'm only 29 so I'm speaking from experiences with my peers and those younger than me.\n\nI am white. I came from Southern California to live in Kentucky and then relocated to Tennessee. It was very much a culture shock. Not the least of which because there is a visceral awareness of the Civil War and racial history in America here. In fact is it inescapable.\n\nIn the course of my life I was once in a relationship with a (white) girl who was taking African American studies in college. So I got completely inundated with African American history, literature and civil rights. And because of that my views are a bit biased.\n\nI was heavily influenced by the ideas and works of the likes of Toni Morrison, W. E. B. Dubois, Booker T Washington, Ralph Waldo Ellison (and yes, I know that's crossing a number of eras there).\n\nSlavery was fairly unique in the United States in as much as it was integrated with an inherent racist bias. Slavery was racial. The inferiority of the \"negro\" was never in question. Much like an inverse ubermensch.\n\nSo when the institution of slavery was ended those intrinsic racist elements didn't disappear. And they were a part of the North as much as the South. And they were in Blacks as much as Whites.\n\nI don't think the Nation as a whole has overcome that. I don't think the Black community has overcome that.

(And if you think about the historical context of a woman *taking* a man's last name, it really *is* **all** of us)\n\nI am Jewish and I have a German last name.\n\nBut I am not *not* German.  In fact, that is what the Nazi's would have wanted, for me not to consider myself part of the German heritage.  To me my last name is a joke on them.   I'm still alive, I'm doing well, and I'm *still* German.  \n\nI realize this is not a perfect analogue because my family was likely never *forced* to immigrate to Germany, and my German name is not because of our status as actual property, only as cultural assimilates.\n\nBut the parallel I *am* trying to draw here is, do you think of yourself as African?  Or do you think of yourself as a Black American?\n\nIt is true that that immigration and that culture was forced upon you, and is a signification of a generational atrocity but it is also a sign of how far Black people have come in America that you can now *decide* whether you want to keep that name or not.  \n\nYou are not just any person from Africa, you are a Black American and I think that struggle is special and a part of who you are.\n\nThat name is also proof that you have been here longer than most white Americans and are more \"American\" than most of us.\n\nThe ancestors of slave owners brought your ancestors here as slaves, thinking they could keep democracy and freedom to themselves, but they couldn't and the jokes on them.  \n\n\nBut like I said, don't let *me* tell you about your past our how it feels to be Black or it feels to be you, and please don't think I'm trying to pull the whole \"comparing the Holocaust to slavery being Jewish is just like being Black thing.\"\n\nAlternatively I want you to consider this as well:\n\nCould you change your name to an Afro-Americanization of your Anglo name?\n\nLike I mispronounce and misspell my name in an Anglo way which would be a huge slap in the face to Volkisch Nazi sympathizers.

I can only recommend certain things for you to think about while you make this deeply personal decision.\n\nFirst, think about the inconvenience of changing your last name. You will have to correct all of the legal documents with your last name on it, and you will have to tell everyone you know that your last name is different now. Things will be sent to you under your old name rather than your current name, and you will have to remember both your old name and your new name and respond to both. It will also create confusion when you are at family gatherings and when people try to figure out who your ancestors are.\n\nSecond, think about the fact that slavery is over. The white man doesn't own you any more. What happened was horrible, but it's over now, and all most people care about is what your current last name is. If a lot of people looked down on you for having a last name chosen by slave masters, then you would have some reason to change your last name, but no one really notices in the modern world.\n\nThird, think about wearing your last name, not as a sign of submission to the white man, but as a way of honoring your ancestors. Your ancestors worked hard for their entire lives under your last name due to unjustly being captured and enslaved, so maybe you shouldn't abandon them by changing your last name and disassociating yourself with them (I'm not saying you are, this is just another way of looking at it). It might also be seen as you disassociating yourself from your other living family members, or a rebuke to them for not changing their last names.\n\nI hope this has been helpful."}, {"id": "2mhg29", "body": "I won't say my name, but because of slavery, it is extremely common and unoriginal. it doesn't help that I have a fairly common first name.\nI feel extremely frustrated that I have the last name of someone who would mistreat my ancestors and make them work for no pay.

Shakespeare\n\n\n2. Your ancestors survived and outlived the slavery and the slaver.  That's a story about a survivor, not a slave.\n\n\n3. Someone named you, and it wasn't a slave.  The slaveowner probably didn't pick their name either.  Could have been worse; don't forget, some genius in the U.S. tried to name their child Adolph Hitler.\n\n\n4. Stop thinking about yourself as a \"black American;\" just be an American, internalizing the principles in the Constitution/Bill of Rights, without forgetting the flaws in human nature that led to the injustices of unequal application of those principles.  \"Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all.\" T. Roosevelt  Those aren't old frailties, and they're not \"white\" frailties - the capacity for inhumanity and injustice is in all of us.  \n\n\n5. It's your name - own it or change it to whatever makes you happy, but quit worrying about it being associated with slavery - if you hadn't said it, nobody else would have thought of it.  The truth is, you have complete power over how people (including you, unless you're named \"Adolph Hitler,\" in which case, my condolences)  think of your name.  Case in point:  Robert Downey, Sr.  Wouldn't even know he existed if it weren't for Robert Downey, Jr.  There it is, though: \"Jr\" - a permanent part of his name, telling everyone he didn't even get a single name of his own, he got a second-hand name by which to be known for his whole life as the product of his father's fornication.  But (and I'm not advocating you go the whole \"Less Than Zero\"/addiction path) we don't even THINK of his father, because RDJ has made the name HIS OWN.\n\n\n6. Elijah Muhammed, psh.  What crimes DIDN'T he commit against the brothers he claimed to love?  All the while, stirring up the emnity with liberation theology.  He was a powerful orator, and he catered to a real and warranted sense of injustice among American blacks, but what kind of nonsense is it to say \"...by international rights, you belong to the white man of America\" and \"he knows that.\"  It's beyond absurd.  \n\n(edit for formatting)\n"}, {"id": "2mhg29", "body": "I won't say my name, but because of slavery, it is extremely common and unoriginal. it doesn't help that I have a fairly common first name.\nI feel extremely frustrated that I have the last name of someone who would mistreat my ancestors and make them work for no pay.
