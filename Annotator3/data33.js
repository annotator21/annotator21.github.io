In my defense, I would point out that a black/hispanic on the other side would be just as affected. With this argument, everyone has a bias and an agenda. \n\nFirst the facts:\n [SAT Scores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Bias_against_Asians_and_whites) (Note: while this is in the criticism sections, please only look at the data and not the editorial comments, as to get a non-biased outlook)\n\n[Black graduation](http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) (Note: as this is called the \"Black Journal of Higher Education\", I trust that no one will call me out on using a source that favors my case)\n\n       1. Let's address my last claim first: It doesn't improve the \"black condition\" and is unnecessary for the vast majority of blacks/hispanics\n\n-This idea is supposed to \"level the playing field\" with all races. All this actually does is passes deserving and intelligent Whites and Asians over for less intelligent and undeserving people in an environment they can't succeed in. For example, [black graduation rates are much lower than white graduation rates.] (http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) The difference reaches up to +20 points, which is clearly not equality. This disparity is due to affirmative action putting incompetent and undeserving Blacks and Hispanics in college. However, I must make an important clarification. I believe that the vast majority of blacks can succeed in college, and have done so. Affirmative action is not necessary for these kinds of people. The only people affirmative action helps are those who wouldn't be able to get into college otherwise, and by getting them into college, they will only have false expectations and ultimately perform poorly when they realize that college grading is color blind. This is the idea of [mismatching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action#Mismatching) and has been backed up by research. \n\n          2. Affirmative action unfairly favors blacks/hispanics over Asians, and thus is racist towards Asians. \n\n-Ok, you make the argument that this favoritism towards blacks/hispanics is simply reparations for past transgressions, Jim Crow and the low. Well, Asians have been heavily discriminated against in the past. Jap interment, railroad building, and racial slurs and stereotypes have all been a part of Asian-American history. In fact, I'd argue that hispanics have been least discriminated in US history. [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States#Asian_Americans) From this, if you believe that AA is \"payback\" for past actions, defend the favoring of blacks over Asian Americans.\n\n           3. Affirmative action is a result of blacks/hispanics that just want to favor their own race. \n\nNote: I must admit, for this I have no direct proof, only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others.\n\n-Blacks/Hispanics have more political power in this country than Asians, in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore, I believe AA is simply a way to get the black vote/blacks helping out each other. Obviously, being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. Clarence Thomas, as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black (this is a big factor, a white Justice would get labeled racist), is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist, not only towards other races, but blacks themselves. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas#Equal_protection_and_affirmative_action)\n\n\nThis is my case. While I do admit I believe very strongly in my position, I would point out that I have remained civil in my point, provided sources, and made full disclosure in my situation and any opinions not directly proven by facts.

Is that all upper middle class? Usually upper middle class is more like the top 15%. \n\nLastly, maybe it would make sense to correlate with household wealth (although, that would be ignoring other disadvantages that blacks face). However, think about this from a macro policy perspective: there will be some sort of normal distribution of wealth amongst a population. However, the distribution for blacks is skewed downwards, with a lower mean, and the reason for this is, among other things, racist policies the state enacted in the past. Since the state is a continuous entity, it can make up for past wrongs and attempt to push the entire distribution forward through policies such as AA. This may lead to some inconsistencies on an individual level, but this is public policy. It is dealing with statistics of total populations, and individual cases are irrelevant.

I believe that the vast majority of blacks can succeed in college, and have done so. Affirmative action is not necessary for these kinds of people.

Affirmative action is a result of blacks/hispanics that just want to favor their own race. \n\nNote: I must admit, for this I have no direct proof, only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others.\n\n-Blacks/Hispanics have more political power in this country than Asians, in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore, I believe AA is simply a way to get the black vote/blacks helping out each other. Obviously, being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. Clarence Thomas, as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black (this is a big factor, a white Justice would get labeled racist), is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist, not only towards other races, but blacks themselves.

Affirmative action is a result of blacks/hispanics that just want to favor their own race. \n\nNote: I must admit, for this I have no direct proof, only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others.\n\n-Blacks/Hispanics have more political power in this country than Asians, in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore, I believe AA is simply a way to get the black vote/blacks helping out each other. Obviously, being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. Clarence Thomas, as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black (this is a big factor, a white Justice would get labeled racist), is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist, not only towards other races, but blacks themselves. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas#Equal_protection_and_affirmative_action)\n\n\nThis is my case. While I do admit I believe very strongly in my position, I would point out that I have remained civil in my point, provided sources, and made full disclosure in my situation and any opinions not directly proven by facts. Most importantly, I recognize that I am heavily influenced by this topic, and thus may be blinded. I hope we can have a civil discourse.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, if you limit your looks to areas with high Asian population or technology/engineering schools, you find that there are quite a few more Asian Americans that make it in to college, though a large part of this is due to stereotyping. Even more so, it appears that a lot of colleges prefer getting Asian students directly from overseas more than local Asian Americans.

I know that's not your point, but it's not like ethical consumerism and legislative action are mutually exclusive. Having ethical consumerism does not mean that legislation gets sloppy. Legislation gets sloppy because of private interest groups and lobbying muddling the issues.\n\nEven if legislation isn't tainted, and we can assume that lawmakers always do the \"ethical\" thing when it comes to regulatory statutes, then there's still the problem of time. Legislation is SLOW. Like, crazy fucking slow. It's really hard to set in motion rules and regulations, and it takes a long time to do that. Plus it also takes a long time to see whether the law is functioning as expected.\n\nEthical consumerism can be much more expedient if the movement is large enough. Companies are slaves to the dollar, and if consumers unilaterally stop paying, companies change their tune. Look at what happened with Microsoft before the launch of the Xbox One. They came up with all these features and rules that no consumer wanted. People unilaterally backed the PS4. So what did Microsoft do? They fired the head of the Xbox division, abolished most of their unpopular features, cut the price, and set out a new business plan that was more consumer-friendly.\n\nWhile you may not think this was an example of ethical consumerism as you defined it, it actually is. The rules Microsoft wanted to implement on how users could utilize their games and the system morally outraged gamers. They thought it was unethical for a company to restrict used game sales the way Microsoft proposed. So they voted with their money and PS4 crushed the XB1 on launch. Microsoft is just now starting to see a lurch in sales after cutting the price of the XB1 below the price of a PS4 and totally abolishing the features that were unwanted. \n\nGamers could have waited for legislation to pass that would ban companies from restricting used game sales (commerce clause would allow Congress to do this) but it would have been extremely slow and most likely would have never gotten to the floor in the first place. So in this sense, \"ethical consumerism\" can take the place of legislation when the issue isn't a hot-button issue in politics, or the consumer group is underrepresented in politics, or time is of the essence. \n"}, {"id": "2mqujn", "body": "With black friday coming up, I thought this would be a fun topic to discuss.\n\nEthical consumerism is a type of consumer activism that is based on the concept of dollar voting.

In fact, isn't there an even greater incentive for you to raise awareness and tap in to the potential of people who don't even know that their clothes were made in sweatshops?\n\nAbout the fact that ethical consumerism puts the burden on the consumer as opposed to the corporation, there's an app for that: [Buycott](http://www.buycott.com/). It still requires people to do their own research and make their own campaigns, but it makes it much easier to identify what the companies you buy from have been doing.\n\nIn practice, it's much harder to establish laws that protect human rights, because corporations always find ways around them. In the US, labor reform only came about after decades of sustained pressure from labor unions, as well as the general public. Guess which side the government sent troops to shoot at? The union workers with less money, of course.\n\nEstablishing ethical government regulations involves a much more strenuous kind of activism: you have to find a candidate that isn't corrupt yet who can still win an election that is largely determined by corporate sponsorship. I'm not trying to be a fatalist here; by all means, use your vote and be active in politics! Just be aware that government isn't something you can always depend on, and it isn't the only solution either.\n\nOverall, remember that it's not an issue of which is the perfect solution. Why can't you have both? It is far too easy to overlook the impact of the choices we make when the results aren't immediately apparent, but just know that even if the statistics of world poverty don't change, people do. You can't expect to free millions of people just by choosing what you buy, but even if your choices change one person's life for the better, this is a tremendous impact. You shouldn't brush this impact away just because you can't see it."}, {"id": "2mqujn", "body": "With black friday coming up, I thought this would be a fun topic to discuss.\n\nEthical consumerism is a type of consumer activism that is based on the concept of dollar voting.

In practice, this means that ethical consumerism is, at best, a mostly-irrelevant niche market, a lonely island in a sea of unethical behavior.\n\nYou're forgetting the moral utility of knowing that particular product is better for the planet.  Contributing, even in a small way, towards a better environment.  My sustainable, organic, fair wage coffee may still deliver the same caffeine dose as the cheap generic coffee, but knowing that one was produced with my particular ethics in mind, is of great utility to me, even if the product performs similarly.\n\nIt's not a \"mostly irrelevant niche market\".  I can tell that by the ever increasing 'green' options in the market place.  I can go to just about every grocery store in the country now, and find organic produce, and fair trade products.  Maybe 10 years ago it was niche, but there is strong consumer momentum growing, to the point that large, corporate businesses are getting involved now.\n\nWhere once I had to go a co-op, pay a membership fee, and pay a premium to get organic produce.  Now I can go to Wal-Mart and get it.  That's not niche in the slightest.\n\n&gt; Secondly, it puts the impetus on the consumer, not on the corporation to determine the responsible use of resources. \n\nWell...that's kind of an inherent problem with the market place that can't be limited without destroying the market.  Consumer demand drives the market, not the other way around.\n\nConsumers demand lower prices, and more goods.  Producers respond to that demand.\n\n&gt;  In practice, ethical consumerism is used as an excuse to abolish democratically-implemented regulations, leaving huge questions- the environment, workers rights, and the like to the will of a system that inherently values profit over superficial \"ethics\".\n\nWhat about democratically implemented regulations that specifically ignore the environment?  What if a nation, collectively decides they just don't give a fuck about clean water, or air, or workers rights?\n\n&gt; Whether or not Florida is sunk by rising sea levels is not a triviality that should be left to making sure you buy the right soy sauce. \n\nToo bad man, that's the option now.  That's the both greatest strength and the glaring weakness of a global marketplace.  Sweatshop labor is horribly exploitative, but for many of those workers it's horrible hours in a sweatshop, or horrible hours in a field growing crops.  They make more money in the sweatshop, and can afford a better life than they can being a farmer.\n\nCapitalism is a democratic process, you just vote with your wallet instead of a punch card. If you want environmentally friendly productions, if you want people to be paid fairly, then you need to purchase products from companies that do just that.\n\nThere are businesses that operate with ethics clearly in mind, and their products cost more.  That's just the bottom line.  Just like using public transportation, or walking, or riding a bike needs to be a conscious choice instead of driving your car everywhere, so does participating in the market and buying products that are created in a way you condone.\n\nThere is nothing you and I can do to force the Chinese people to stop working themselves to death and polluting their country, short of starting a war and killing them to show them the error of their ways.  Which seems like a pretty ass-backwards way of doing something.  What you can do is spend your money on companies that do things right, to make them successful, and to drive the unethical companies out of the market, out of business."}, {"id": "2mqujn", "body": "With black friday coming up, I thought this would be a fun topic to discuss.\n\nEthical consumerism is a type of consumer activism that is based on the concept of dollar voting.

In it, he explains how Muslim immigration to the West is not significantly different from earlier waves of immigration, that once arrived Muslims do not display a tendency to integrate less well or less thoroughly than other immigrant groups, and that the idea of Muslim-majority European countries is nonsense based in either a poor understanding of statistics or their deliberate misrepresentation.\n\nI have always thought that the hysteria about 'Eurabia' was nonsense, and I've noted that the language being used today is remarkably similar to anti-Semitic and anti-Irish propaganda a century ago. Where I live in Quebec, there has been sustained debate about 'reasonable accommodation' of Muslim immigrants, with the implication that for some reason they were different than other immigrants, which I have always found absurd, having lived in a Muslim country, and having Muslim friends. I believe that this hysteria stems from  racist fear and generalized ignorance, and don't think fears of Islamic takeover of the world are at all founded in reality. Recently I picked up Saunders' book and found it full of statistics which validated my views. \n\nHere are some claims by proponents of the 'Eurabia' narrative, and facts countering those claims.\n\n&gt; 1 . The Muslim population is growing fast and will soon be a majority in Europe.\n\n2011 polls by pew Research Center revealed that the EU plus Norway and Switzerland ('Europe', for the purposes of the rest of this post) had a Muslim population consisting of 4.5% of the population. If current birthrate trends and immigration levels remain stable it will be 7.1% in 2030. Their highest prediction, including very high rates of fertility and sustained high immigration, makes it just possible they will constitute 9.5% by 2050. (In the US by 2030 they will make up 1.7% of the population.) Countries with very low fertility rates, like Sweden, could see populations of Muslims maxing out at 15% by 2050. \n\n&gt; 2 . Yeah, but being Muslim leads to much higher birthrates so eventually they will take over, even if it's not by 2050.\n\nIran and Turkey, two countries governed by Islamist governments, have birthrates at or below the replacement level of 2.1. (Iran's fell from 7 to 1.7 in the last thirty years.) Albania is the continent's largest Muslim-majority country and has a birthrate of 2, the same as France, and Bosnia's Muslims one of 1.23. The fertility rate across all Muslim-majority countries in the world has fallen from an average of 4.5 to 2.3 in the last 15 years. Some countries like Niger have much higher rates (7.2), but Muslims in West Africa have lower birthrates than their Christian or animist compatriots. French demographer Youssef Courbage conducted a major study showing the the Muslim world is undergoing one of the fastest declines in fertility rates in history, and that this decline is the most rapid in the countries which have the most immigration to the West.\n\n&gt; 3 . Okay but they still reproduce more than Westerners once they get here\n\nA century ago, Jewish and Catholic immigrants were seen as terrifying threats to their host countries because of their high fertility rates. But within two generations their fertility rates merged with the general populations. The same is happening with Muslims. Another major French study found that the longer Muslim women stayed in France, the lower their fertility rate became. Britons were startled to learn that Mohamed was the country's most popular boy's name in 2010: this is true, if you count all 12 spelling variants as one name, but it's because Muslims have much less variety in their naming practices. Mohameds were 1% of British newborns in 2010. German Turks had a fertility rate of 4.4 in 1970; today it is 2.2, merging with the German national average of 2. Austria is one of the countries with the lowest birthrates in Europe, and many 'Eurabia' proponents have warned that it will soon be over-run. But like elsewhere, Muslim immigrants in Austria are subject to the same pressures as native-born people, and their birthrate has dropped from 3.09 to 2.3 in 20 years, the fastest-falling rate of any group in Austria. Fertility rates of Muslim immigrants to Britain from the Indian subcontinent, who are the Muslim immigrants with the highest birthrate, have dropped by half in 20 years and continue to drop, and will likely reach parity with the population in the next 20-30 years. Study after study has predicted that by 2030, across the entire European continent including Russia, the difference between Muslim birthrates and non-Muslim will be a maximum of 0.4.\n\nMuch propaganda has been made about these fertility rates. One video on Youtube viewed 13 million times ('Muslim Demographics') claims for example that French Muslim families have 8.1 children compared to the French 1.8. The real figures are 2.8 vs 1.9. It claims a quarter of Belgium is Muslim when in reality it's 6%. Etc\n\n&gt; 4 . Yeah but in the future a lot more immigration will be Muslim\n\nIn fact Slavs are rapidly replacing Muslims in terms of the demography of immigration to Western Europe, and Muslim immigration to Europe is directly correlated with economic conditions, not some nefarious plan. After the recession, illegal immigration to Europe dropped by 2/3 and 232,000 immigrants left Spain as jobs disappeared. Most European countries' immigrants are in large majority not Muslim, with the exception of France, 68% of whose immigrants are North African Muslims -- largely because a generation ago, they were French citizens when their homelands were part of France.\n\n&gt; 5 . Weak-kneed atheist socialism means Europe is declining and has no will to resist Islamic takeover and can't reproduce fast enough to keep up\n\nThe most religious Christian countries in Europe are the countries with the lowest birthrates. The countries with the highest birthrates are all Scandinavian social democracies or big-spending welfare states. Muslim immigrants do not settle in declining countries like Portugal or Slovakia but in fast-reproducing countries like Sweden or booming countries like Germany. Muslims are coming to the strongest and most appealing societies they can find and trying hard to become members. \n\n&gt; 6 . Islam is an ideology not a religion, and Muslims regard it as their duty to destroy their new Western homes\n\nEuropean Muslims identify themselves as 'Muslim first and [Nationality] second' more than native-born Europeans but far less than Muslims in Muslim countries. Fewer than 5% of French Muslims attend mosque every week (compared to 9% of French Catholics). 20% of French citizens of Muslim background said they had no religion at all, compared to 28% of other French citizens. In the US, 49% of Muslims said they were Muslim before being Americans -- like the 46% of other Americans (and 70% of Evangelicals) who say the same. Muslim immigrants tend to adopt the attitudes toward religion of their host countries, and their children even more so. Of Muslims born in the US, 41% accept homosexuality, compared to 58% of other Americans. In France, half of French Muslims accept sex between unmarried men and women, and 35% tolerate abortion. Muslim immigrants are adopting these views far more rapidly than Western populations did.\n\n&gt; 7 . Muslims are loyal to Islam or their birth countries, not to their host countries and their values.\n\nStudies across Europe have found that Muslims are actually more likely to express confidence in Western institutions than the general population.

In it, he explains how Muslim immigration to the West is not significantly different from earlier waves of immigration, that once arrived Muslims do not display a tendency to integrate less well or less thoroughly than other immigrant groups, and that the idea of Muslim-majority European countries is nonsense based in either a poor understanding of statistics or their deliberate misrepresentation.\n\nI have always thought that the hysteria about 'Eurabia' was nonsense, and I've noted that the language being used today is remarkably similar to anti-Semitic and anti-Irish propaganda a century ago. Where I live in Quebec, there has been sustained debate about 'reasonable accommodation' of Muslim immigrants, with the implication that for some reason they were different than other immigrants, which I have always found absurd, having lived in a Muslim country, and having Muslim friends. I believe that this hysteria stems from  racist fear and generalized ignorance, and don't think fears of Islamic takeover of the world are at all founded in reality. Recently I picked up Saunders' book and found it full of statistics which validated my views. \n\nHere are some claims by proponents of the 'Eurabia' narrative, and facts countering those claims.\n\n&gt; 1 . The Muslim population is growing fast and will soon be a majority in Europe.\n\n2011 polls by pew Research Center revealed that the EU plus Norway and Switzerland ('Europe', for the purposes of the rest of this post) had a Muslim population consisting of 4.5% of the population. If current birthrate trends and immigration levels remain stable it will be 7.1% in 2030. Their highest prediction, including very high rates of fertility and sustained high immigration, makes it just possible they will constitute 9.5% by 2050. (In the US by 2030 they will make up 1.7% of the population.) Countries with very low fertility rates, like Sweden, could see populations of Muslims maxing out at 15% by 2050. \n\n&gt; 2 . Yeah, but being Muslim leads to much higher birthrates so eventually they will take over, even if it's not by 2050.\n\nIran and Turkey, two countries governed by Islamist governments, have birthrates at or below the replacement level of 2.1. (Iran's fell from 7 to 1.7 in the last thirty years.) Albania is the continent's largest Muslim-majority country and has a birthrate of 2, the same as France, and Bosnia's Muslims one of 1.23. The fertility rate across all Muslim-majority countries in the world has fallen from an average of 4.5 to 2.3 in the last 15 years. Some countries like Niger have much higher rates (7.2), but Muslims in West Africa have lower birthrates than their Christian or animist compatriots. French demographer Youssef Courbage conducted a major study showing the the Muslim world is undergoing one of the fastest declines in fertility rates in history, and that this decline is the most rapid in the countries which have the most immigration to the West.\n\n&gt; 3 . Okay but they still reproduce more than Westerners once they get here\n\nA century ago, Jewish and Catholic immigrants were seen as terrifying threats to their host countries because of their high fertility rates. But within two generations their fertility rates merged with the general populations. The same is happening with Muslims. Another major French study found that the longer Muslim women stayed in France, the lower their fertility rate became. Britons were startled to learn that Mohamed was the country's most popular boy's name in 2010: this is true, if you count all 12 spelling variants as one name, but it's because Muslims have much less variety in their naming practices. Mohameds were 1% of British newborns in 2010. German Turks had a fertility rate of 4.4 in 1970; today it is 2.2, merging with the German national average of 2. Austria is one of the countries with the lowest birthrates in Europe, and many 'Eurabia' proponents have warned that it will soon be over-run. But like elsewhere, Muslim immigrants in Austria are subject to the same pressures as native-born people, and their birthrate has dropped from 3.09 to 2.3 in 20 years, the fastest-falling rate of any group in Austria. Fertility rates of Muslim immigrants to Britain from the Indian subcontinent, who are the Muslim immigrants with the highest birthrate, have dropped by half in 20 years and continue to drop, and will likely reach parity with the population in the next 20-30 years. Study after study has predicted that by 2030, across the entire European continent including Russia, the difference between Muslim birthrates and non-Muslim will be a maximum of 0.4.\n\nMuch propaganda has been made about these fertility rates. One video on Youtube viewed 13 million times ('Muslim Demographics') claims for example that French Muslim families have 8.1 children compared to the French 1.8. The real figures are 2.8 vs 1.9. It claims a quarter of Belgium is Muslim when in reality it's 6%. Etc\n\n&gt; 4 . Yeah but in the future a lot more immigration will be Muslim\n\nIn fact Slavs are rapidly replacing Muslims in terms of the demography of immigration to Western Europe, and Muslim immigration to Europe is directly correlated with economic conditions, not some nefarious plan. After the recession, illegal immigration to Europe dropped by 2/3 and 232,000 immigrants left Spain as jobs disappeared. Most European countries' immigrants are in large majority not Muslim, with the exception of France, 68% of whose immigrants are North African Muslims -- largely because a generation ago, they were French citizens when their homelands were part of France.\n\n&gt; 5 . Weak-kneed atheist socialism means Europe is declining and has no will to resist Islamic takeover and can't reproduce fast enough to keep up\n\nThe most religious Christian countries in Europe are the countries with the lowest birthrates. The countries with the highest birthrates are all Scandinavian social democracies or big-spending welfare states. Muslim immigrants do not settle in declining countries like Portugal or Slovakia but in fast-reproducing countries like Sweden or booming countries like Germany. Muslims are coming to the strongest and most appealing societies they can find and trying hard to become members. \n\n&gt; 6 . Islam is an ideology not a religion, and Muslims regard it as their duty to destroy their new Western homes\n\nEuropean Muslims identify themselves as 'Muslim first and [Nationality] second' more than native-born Europeans but far less than Muslims in Muslim countries. Fewer than 5% of French Muslims attend mosque every week (compared to 9% of French Catholics). 20% of French citizens of Muslim background said they had no religion at all, compared to 28% of other French citizens. In the US, 49% of Muslims said they were Muslim before being Americans -- like the 46% of other Americans (and 70% of Evangelicals) who say the same. Muslim immigrants tend to adopt the attitudes toward religion of their host countries, and their children even more so. Of Muslims born in the US, 41% accept homosexuality, compared to 58% of other Americans. In France, half of French Muslims accept sex between unmarried men and women, and 35% tolerate abortion. Muslim immigrants are adopting these views far more rapidly than Western populations did.\n\n&gt; 7 . Muslims are loyal to Islam or their birth countries, not to their host countries and their values.\n\nStudies across Europe have found that Muslims are actually more likely to express confidence in Western institutions than the general population. A 2009 Gallup poll found British Muslims identified more strongly with Britain than did all other populations surveyed. 77% of British Muslims said they identified 'extremely' or 'very' strongly with being British, as compared to 50% of Britons in general. 31% said Britain was in decline, as opposed to 50% of Anglicans.

People who are anti-Islamic aren't going to read this and say, \"Ohhhh, they're not immigrating nearly as quickly as I thought. No cause for alarm.\" Someone who is anti-Islam doesn't care - they are opposed to the fundamental religious and cultural values of Islam, in contrast with their own. It doesn't help that there are extremists to help reinforce their biases - though to be fair, most people wouldn't be biased against Islam if not for the extremism associated with it. (This isn't the fault of Muslims in general, of course, but to pretend that all bigots are just bigots and that starts and ends internally with them is foolish. Bigotry is generally a reaction to external circumstances or information).

If they mostly identified much more with Islam than with the modernist, liberal, secular, national values of Europe, that would be a worrying trend, but they do not appear to do so. In short, Islamophobia in Europe would be justified to some degree if its claims were factual, but they are not."}, {"id": "2mqlhb", "body": "My source is the book 'The Myth of the Muslim Tide' by Doug Saunders. In it, he explains how Muslim immigration to the West is not significantly different from earlier waves of immigration, that once arrived Muslims do not display a tendency to integrate less well or less thoroughly than other immigrant groups, and that the idea of Muslim-majority European countries is nonsense based in either a poor understanding of statistics or their deliberate misrepresentation.\n\nI have always thought that the hysteria about 'Eurabia' was nonsense, and I've noted that the language being used today is remarkably similar to anti-Semitic and anti-Irish propaganda a century ago. Where I live in Quebec, there has been sustained debate about 'reasonable accommodation' of Muslim immigrants, with the implication that for some reason they were different than other immigrants, which I have always found absurd, having lived in a Muslim country, and having Muslim friends. I believe that this hysteria stems from  racist fear and generalized ignorance, and don't think fears of Islamic takeover of the world are at all founded in reality. Recently I picked up Saunders' book and found it full of statistics which validated my views. \n\nHere are some claims by proponents of the 'Eurabia' narrative, and facts countering those claims.\n\n&gt; 1 . The Muslim population is growing fast and will soon be a majority in Europe.\n\n2011 polls by pew Research Center revealed that the EU plus Norway and Switzerland ('Europe', for the purposes of the rest of this post) had a Muslim population consisting of 4.5% of the population. If current birthrate trends and immigration levels remain stable it will be 7.1% in 2030. Their highest prediction, including very high rates of fertility and sustained high immigration, makes it just possible they will constitute 9.5% by 2050. (In the US by 2030 they will make up 1.7% of the population.) Countries with very low fertility rates, like Sweden, could see populations of Muslims maxing out at 15% by 2050. \n\n&gt; 2 . Yeah, but being Muslim leads to much higher birthrates so eventually they will take over, even if it's not by 2050.\n\nIran and Turkey, two countries governed by Islamist governments, have birthrates at or below the replacement level of 2.1. (Iran's fell from 7 to 1.7 in the last thirty years.) Albania is the continent's largest Muslim-majority country and has a birthrate of 2, the same as France, and Bosnia's Muslims one of 1.23. The fertility rate across all Muslim-majority countries in the world has fallen from an average of 4.5 to 2.3 in the last 15 years. Some countries like Niger have much higher rates (7.2), but Muslims in West Africa have lower birthrates than their Christian or animist compatriots. French demographer Youssef Courbage conducted a major study showing the the Muslim world is undergoing one of the fastest declines in fertility rates in history, and that this decline is the most rapid in the countries which have the most immigration to the West.\n\n&gt; 3 . Okay but they still reproduce more than Westerners once they get here\n\nA century ago, Jewish and Catholic immigrants were seen as terrifying threats to their host countries because of their high fertility rates. But within two generations their fertility rates merged with the general populations. The same is happening with Muslims. Another major French study found that the longer Muslim women stayed in France, the lower their fertility rate became. Britons were startled to learn that Mohamed was the country's most popular boy's name in 2010: this is true, if you count all 12 spelling variants as one name, but it's because Muslims have much less variety in their naming practices. Mohameds were 1% of British newborns in 2010. German Turks had a fertility rate of 4.4 in 1970; today it is 2.2, merging with the German national average of 2. Austria is one of the countries with the lowest birthrates in Europe, and many 'Eurabia' proponents have warned that it will soon be over-run. But like elsewhere, Muslim immigrants in Austria are subject to the same pressures as native-born people, and their birthrate has dropped from 3.09 to 2.3 in 20 years, the fastest-falling rate of any group in Austria. Fertility rates of Muslim immigrants to Britain from the Indian subcontinent, who are the Muslim immigrants with the highest birthrate, have dropped by half in 20 years and continue to drop, and will likely reach parity with the population in the next 20-30 years. Study after study has predicted that by 2030, across the entire European continent including Russia, the difference between Muslim birthrates and non-Muslim will be a maximum of 0.4.\n\nMuch propaganda has been made about these fertility rates. One video on Youtube viewed 13 million times ('Muslim Demographics') claims for example that French Muslim families have 8.1 children compared to the French 1.8. The real figures are 2.8 vs 1.9. It claims a quarter of Belgium is Muslim when in reality it's 6%. Etc\n\n&gt; 4 . Yeah but in the future a lot more immigration will be Muslim\n\nIn fact Slavs are rapidly replacing Muslims in terms of the demography of immigration to Western Europe, and Muslim immigration to Europe is directly correlated with economic conditions, not some nefarious plan. After the recession, illegal immigration to Europe dropped by 2/3 and 232,000 immigrants left Spain as jobs disappeared. Most European countries' immigrants are in large majority not Muslim, with the exception of France, 68% of whose immigrants are North African Muslims -- largely because a generation ago, they were French citizens when their homelands were part of France.\n\n&gt; 5 . Weak-kneed atheist socialism means Europe is declining and has no will to resist Islamic takeover and can't reproduce fast enough to keep up\n\nThe most religious Christian countries in Europe are the countries with the lowest birthrates. The countries with the highest birthrates are all Scandinavian social democracies or big-spending welfare states. Muslim immigrants do not settle in declining countries like Portugal or Slovakia but in fast-reproducing countries like Sweden or booming countries like Germany. Muslims are coming to the strongest and most appealing societies they can find and trying hard to become members. \n\n&gt; 6 . Islam is an ideology not a religion, and Muslims regard it as their duty to destroy their new Western homes\n\nEuropean Muslims identify themselves as 'Muslim first and [Nationality] second' more than native-born Europeans but far less than Muslims in Muslim countries. Fewer than 5% of French Muslims attend mosque every week (compared to 9% of French Catholics). 20% of French citizens of Muslim background said they had no religion at all, compared to 28% of other French citizens. In the US, 49% of Muslims said they were Muslim before being Americans -- like the 46% of other Americans (and 70% of Evangelicals) who say the same. Muslim immigrants tend to adopt the attitudes toward religion of their host countries, and their children even more so. Of Muslims born in the US, 41% accept homosexuality, compared to 58% of other Americans. In France, half of French Muslims accept sex between unmarried men and women, and 35% tolerate abortion. Muslim immigrants are adopting these views far more rapidly than Western populations did.\n\n&gt; 7 . Muslims are loyal to Islam or their birth countries, not to their host countries and their values.\n\nStudies across Europe have found that Muslims are actually more likely to express confidence in Western institutions than the general population. A 2009 Gallup poll found British Muslims identified more strongly with Britain than did all other populations surveyed. 77% of British Muslims said they identified 'extremely' or 'very' strongly with being British, as compared to 50% of Britons in general. 31% said Britain was in decline, as opposed to 50% of Anglicans. Similar trends can be observed in France. 8/10 of French Muslims were fine with inter-faith dating, and 59% with inter-faith marriage. Currently a quarter of French Muslim women are married to non-Muslims and half of French Muslim young men are cohabiting with non-Muslims. Muslims have integrated well into public institutions and political parties across Europe, notably Britain's Conservative Party, the German Green party (the 3rd largest) and Sarkozy's first cabinet. \n\nI could keep going, but I think you get the picture.\n\n*Edited when I re-read the rules, to make it clear that I personally hold this view, not just Doug Saunders (and to correct typos).\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Remember that they still hold at least some connection to their homeland and by extension their religious brethren.\n\nApologies if that was jumbled a bit, I'm trying to type on my phone but haven't got used to the keyboard yet.\n"}, {"id": "2mqlhb", "body": "My source is the book 'The Myth of the Muslim Tide' by Doug Saunders. In it, he explains how Muslim immigration to the West is not significantly different from earlier waves of immigration, that once arrived Muslims do not display a tendency to integrate less well or less thoroughly than other immigrant groups, and that the idea of Muslim-majority European countries is nonsense based in either a poor understanding of statistics or their deliberate misrepresentation.\n\nI have always thought that the hysteria about 'Eurabia' was nonsense, and I've noted that the language being used today is remarkably similar to anti-Semitic and anti-Irish propaganda a century ago. Where I live in Quebec, there has been sustained debate about 'reasonable accommodation' of Muslim immigrants, with the implication that for some reason they were different than other immigrants, which I have always found absurd, having lived in a Muslim country, and having Muslim friends. I believe that this hysteria stems from  racist fear and generalized ignorance, and don't think fears of Islamic takeover of the world are at all founded in reality. Recently I picked up Saunders' book and found it full of statistics which validated my views. \n\nHere are some claims by proponents of the 'Eurabia' narrative, and facts countering those claims.\n\n&gt; 1 . The Muslim population is growing fast and will soon be a majority in Europe.\n\n2011 polls by pew Research Center revealed that the EU plus Norway and Switzerland ('Europe', for the purposes of the rest of this post) had a Muslim population consisting of 4.5% of the population. If current birthrate trends and immigration levels remain stable it will be 7.1% in 2030. Their highest prediction, including very high rates of fertility and sustained high immigration, makes it just possible they will constitute 9.5% by 2050. (In the US by 2030 they will make up 1.7% of the population.) Countries with very low fertility rates, like Sweden, could see populations of Muslims maxing out at 15% by 2050. \n\n&gt; 2 . Yeah, but being Muslim leads to much higher birthrates so eventually they will take over, even if it's not by 2050.\n\nIran and Turkey, two countries governed by Islamist governments, have birthrates at or below the replacement level of 2.1. (Iran's fell from 7 to 1.7 in the last thirty years.) Albania is the continent's largest Muslim-majority country and has a birthrate of 2, the same as France, and Bosnia's Muslims one of 1.23. The fertility rate across all Muslim-majority countries in the world has fallen from an average of 4.5 to 2.3 in the last 15 years. Some countries like Niger have much higher rates (7.2), but Muslims in West Africa have lower birthrates than their Christian or animist compatriots. French demographer Youssef Courbage conducted a major study showing the the Muslim world is undergoing one of the fastest declines in fertility rates in history, and that this decline is the most rapid in the countries which have the most immigration to the West.\n\n&gt; 3 . Okay but they still reproduce more than Westerners once they get here\n\nA century ago, Jewish and Catholic immigrants were seen as terrifying threats to their host countries because of their high fertility rates. But within two generations their fertility rates merged with the general populations. The same is happening with Muslims. Another major French study found that the longer Muslim women stayed in France, the lower their fertility rate became. Britons were startled to learn that Mohamed was the country's most popular boy's name in 2010: this is true, if you count all 12 spelling variants as one name, but it's because Muslims have much less variety in their naming practices. Mohameds were 1% of British newborns in 2010. German Turks had a fertility rate of 4.4 in 1970; today it is 2.2, merging with the German national average of 2. Austria is one of the countries with the lowest birthrates in Europe, and many 'Eurabia' proponents have warned that it will soon be over-run. But like elsewhere, Muslim immigrants in Austria are subject to the same pressures as native-born people, and their birthrate has dropped from 3.09 to 2.3 in 20 years, the fastest-falling rate of any group in Austria. Fertility rates of Muslim immigrants to Britain from the Indian subcontinent, who are the Muslim immigrants with the highest birthrate, have dropped by half in 20 years and continue to drop, and will likely reach parity with the population in the next 20-30 years. Study after study has predicted that by 2030, across the entire European continent including Russia, the difference between Muslim birthrates and non-Muslim will be a maximum of 0.4.\n\nMuch propaganda has been made about these fertility rates. One video on Youtube viewed 13 million times ('Muslim Demographics') claims for example that French Muslim families have 8.1 children compared to the French 1.8. The real figures are 2.8 vs 1.9. It claims a quarter of Belgium is Muslim when in reality it's 6%. Etc\n\n&gt; 4 . Yeah but in the future a lot more immigration will be Muslim\n\nIn fact Slavs are rapidly replacing Muslims in terms of the demography of immigration to Western Europe, and Muslim immigration to Europe is directly correlated with economic conditions, not some nefarious plan. After the recession, illegal immigration to Europe dropped by 2/3 and 232,000 immigrants left Spain as jobs disappeared. Most European countries' immigrants are in large majority not Muslim, with the exception of France, 68% of whose immigrants are North African Muslims -- largely because a generation ago, they were French citizens when their homelands were part of France.\n\n&gt; 5 . Weak-kneed atheist socialism means Europe is declining and has no will to resist Islamic takeover and can't reproduce fast enough to keep up\n\nThe most religious Christian countries in Europe are the countries with the lowest birthrates. The countries with the highest birthrates are all Scandinavian social democracies or big-spending welfare states. Muslim immigrants do not settle in declining countries like Portugal or Slovakia but in fast-reproducing countries like Sweden or booming countries like Germany. Muslims are coming to the strongest and most appealing societies they can find and trying hard to become members. \n\n&gt; 6 . Islam is an ideology not a religion, and Muslims regard it as their duty to destroy their new Western homes\n\nEuropean Muslims identify themselves as 'Muslim first and [Nationality] second' more than native-born Europeans but far less than Muslims in Muslim countries. Fewer than 5% of French Muslims attend mosque every week (compared to 9% of French Catholics). 20% of French citizens of Muslim background said they had no religion at all, compared to 28% of other French citizens. In the US, 49% of Muslims said they were Muslim before being Americans -- like the 46% of other Americans (and 70% of Evangelicals) who say the same. Muslim immigrants tend to adopt the attitudes toward religion of their host countries, and their children even more so. Of Muslims born in the US, 41% accept homosexuality, compared to 58% of other Americans. In France, half of French Muslims accept sex between unmarried men and women, and 35% tolerate abortion. Muslim immigrants are adopting these views far more rapidly than Western populations did.\n\n&gt; 7 . Muslims are loyal to Islam or their birth countries, not to their host countries and their values.\n\nStudies across Europe have found that Muslims are actually more likely to express confidence in Western institutions than the general population. A 2009 Gallup poll found British Muslims identified more strongly with Britain than did all other populations surveyed. 77% of British Muslims said they identified 'extremely' or 'very' strongly with being British, as compared to 50% of Britons in general. 31% said Britain was in decline, as opposed to 50% of Anglicans. Similar trends can be observed in France. 8/10 of French Muslims were fine with inter-faith dating, and 59% with inter-faith marriage. Currently a quarter of French Muslim women are married to non-Muslims and half of French Muslim young men are cohabiting with non-Muslims. Muslims have integrated well into public institutions and political parties across Europe, notably Britain's Conservative Party, the German Green party (the 3rd largest) and Sarkozy's first cabinet. \n\nI could keep going, but I think you get the picture.\n\n*Edited when I re-read the rules, to make it clear that I personally hold this view, not just Doug Saunders (and to correct typos).\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Why does no one shed a tear for the Aztecs and Incas, or the Aborigines?\n\nOne last thought. Were the Native Americans any different than we were? Surely they wanted us out of the picture just as much as we wanted them. And before a single European set food on Virginian soil, how many Indian tribes were there? Hundreds!

You just have to be *able* to act like a dickhead. You have to be free.\n\nI'm glad what I wrote resonated for you. Here's another little piece on it, from another post:\n\n&gt;As long as a \"nerdy guy\" doesn't know his real problem is self-respect, he'll substitute quests for real things with quests to \"win\" girls. He's built to have a mission and he knows it, but he's crippled by a need for approval and doesn't know why, and that becomes his mission. \n\n&gt;\"Grow up\" isn't a useful way to talk to him, and labeling him a misogynist borders on specious. Whatever misogyny appears is resentment of the incredible power women have over him; he worships them and can't help it, and he feels he can't move on until they worship him back. It's not entitlement to women's bodies he feels, but entitlement to self-respect. And he really is entitled to that! \n\n&gt;But nobody teaches him how to get it; most of the time he doesn't even know he lacks it. He just knows he needs something, and he only has one idea where to look.\n\n&gt;What society fails to teach him, fails to glamorize, fails to parade in front of his face, is that being true to oneself, being courageous in small and private ways, brings such rewards that the fixation on girls falls away, and he can start to do what he really wants. And that's when it all gets better.\n\n&gt;I only mention society to say that it's not his fault he feels this way. But it is his responsibility to overcome this feeling and find what he wants from women within himself. Tell him to Google self-respect. Tell him to Google radical honesty. But most of all, Tell him he can do it. Tell him there's another way. Tell him there's something better than getting laid; it's called \"knowing that you're worthy.\"\n\n&gt;Then, the real quest can begin."}, {"id": "cm6lnx8", "body": "Damn this really hit home for me.

What that means is that of course there are some women who like those guys and there are some guys who are that way and are friends with each other. Leave those people to themselves.\n\nFor every woman who wants some hyper-masculine asshole there's a woman who wants a man who will respect her and treat her like another human being. \n\n\"Be yourself\" is thrown around a lot in our society, but the message is missed because it's just a two word phrase. When people say, \"Just be yourself!\" they mean that you should just own yourself. Like, have the confidence to accept and be unashamed of what you are. \n\nYou're short. Don't cry about it, accept it as part of who you are and own it by going after women who like short guys (or who are shorter than you are).\n\nYou're an introvert. Don't force yourself into social situations to try and get out there, own your introversion by developing your personal hobbies into interesting talking points, use your introversion to deepen your existing relationships.\n\nJust about anything in life is all about confidence and self-assurance. If you are sure in yourself, as in you know that you can handle most situations in a satisfactory way, people will pick up on that and like you more, including women. \n\nThat's why the dickheads seem to get women; to many people, the hyper-masculine dickheadedness can look like confidence and self-assurance. It often times isn't. Self-assured and truly confident people don't need to put on a facade because they're already comfortable with who they are and *own* it.

For instance, this desire for spending your life with someone. Wow, that's a huge burden to look for from relationships you have when you are 19 or even later. I mean, if we fall in love that's great, but can we just enjoy the moment without the pressure of what this is supposed to be?\n\nI think guys are told that girls need emotional connection and something serious. I know men who tried to \"play\" girls by telling them they love them even when the girls in question told them directly they can't possibly love them yet, they don't need to hear that shit, and they are fine with just hanging out. But many men think that a good girl just looks for someone to marry.\n\nLook if I am 19 I am looking for a friend, someone I am attracted to and connect with. Not wanting to overly commit before i even know the person I am committing to on a truly deep level (plus the fact that we are only just shaping our lives and changing ourselves) doesn't make me an anti intellectual party slut, it makes me just a little more realistic than you.\n\n\nThe problem with guys like this is that they develop expectations of emotions before the person. They don't compliment me by being ready to get serious, they just want to get serious and I fit the mold. They are often very superfeicial, see that you are smart and pretty and already they are deeply in love - yeah, right. \n\nSometimes, I can flirt with guys i see no future with and want none, exactly because of that. They are safe, I won't disappoint them. I don't have to care about their feelings. \n\nBut there are guys who are just like me, and who are nice. They are nice, but they aren't trying to force closeness or a relationship, they need to get to know me first. We can be relaxed around each other. Those are usually the ones that get the most, not the alphas or the \"nice\" guys. Just guys you can identify with. Who go in without great promises or expectations, and create them based on you and what you have together. We know that if something happenes and we have to end it in few months or years, no one will say \"what a waste it was\" but we will look back at our time together as something really great for what it was, not for the preconcieved expectation it failed to fulfil. \n\nAnd being overly curteous - that is nice, but that is nice in such a cold, formal way. It is a formality and when you want to bond with someone you want closeness. Sincerity. Identification. Gestures are just gestures. Of course you should be nice to the girl, and she should be nice to you, but there is no need for flowers and ceremonial behavior. Be nice in a personal way when you get to know her. Small thing every now and then when you get really inspired. Why appreciate the behavior you do so mechanically because you think you should? \n\nA guy and a girl can make out together on a park bench and drink cheap beer and burp around each other and still be the sweetest people to one another and have the best date ever. \n\nYour problem isn't that girls want some alpha type, it is that your idea of niceness is too impersonal, too formal and lacks some true substance. It's ok you're 19. There is a lot to learn about relationships and connecting to people. I suggest stop focusing on finding someone to spend your life with and start focusing on the actual person in front of you and what you have in the moment. Enjoy those moments and learn about people, you don't need to fit it all into some grand plan and girls are no special creatures who are disrespected unless you're ready to marry them right away.
