For many offenses like bylaw violations, speeding and, yes, virtually all cases of drug possession, the only real factor in the case is whether the officer cites/charges the person.  Prosecutorial involvement is slim, if it exists at all, and a huge portion of cases never go near a courtroom.  These cases are by nature very different from cases where you've got a prosecutor *actively* deciding whether to pursue the case based on police evidence, partly because most are basically low-end regulatory offences.  While the prosecutorial model makes sense for more serious cases where significant evidence exists for a prosecutor to consider, it's a lot less reasonable here.\n\nAt best, all removing police discretion would do is shift the burden to prosecutors, who would now have to actively handle a torrent of minor cases where the only relevant evidence is what the officer involved has to say.  Worse, the decision to pursue cases would be shifted from someone actually present to someone whose only contact is hearsay.  That doesn't strike me as an improvement.\n\nAt worst, it would lead to prosecutors simply deciding to pursue everything.  Besides the additional load, this would effectively remove the prosecutorial discretion that is *also* fundamental to our justice system.  Then, you get attempts to \"re-rationalize\" the law which only end up complicating the statute beyond recognition, and things once again dissolve into a massive shit show.\n\nThe *real* solution is to acknowledge that for certain classes of offenses, police officers are in the best position to make the decision whether to pursue.

You seem to be making an argument that voting is not rational, and therefore you shouldn't do it.\n\nHowever, the only logical consequence of this \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" is that only the voices of the irrational are ever heard, and indeed the evidence seems to be that irrational people are ruling most democracies out there. \n\nVoting is a meta-strategy, much like cooperating in a transaction even when you could never be caught defecting to your own benefit. \n\nIf you expect voting to change anything fast, you're also very mistaken. It doesn't. Voting is a long term strategy, not a short term one. As others have mentioned, politicians change their views over the long term to accommodate those that have expressed a willingness to vote for those with views more like their own, even if those candidates are not ideal.\n\nTake the example of the U.S. Libertarians have never achieved much directly by voting for their own candidates, because practically none of them have ever won. However, this did end up in a perception of siphoning votes away from Republican candidates, who have dramatically changed their rhetoric in a direction that they perceive as being libertarian.\n\nYou may think this is a bad thing... but that just reinforces the point. It's effective. It's just not effective today, and if you let other people decide what direction to move things in you might not like the results. \n\nFinally, there's more to voting than electing national representatives. The most important votes you cast are actually for local elections. It will matter far more to you who your town's mayor is, or who the school board members in your area are, than it will *ever* matter *to you* who ends up being Prime Minister.

For example: the social views of Evangelical Christians are generally better represented by the Republicans, whereas the social views of, say, atheists/agnostics are generally better represented by the Democrats. Huge oversimplification, I know, but in the aggregate this holds true. I'm sure you could come up with a million other examples.\n\nSo let's say you have two groups, group A and group B. And two people in each group, so that we have four people, 1A, 2A, 1B, and 2B. Let's simplify things and assume these people can serve as a model for the whle country.\n\nIf 1A and 2A both vote, their candidate always wins. If 1B votes but 2B does not, 2B is undercutting 1B's ability to affect public policy, *even though 1B is voting*. This is particularly true in a winner-take-all system like that of the US.\n\nIn other words, when you choose not to vote you are screwing over people who are similar to you in terms of what policies they look for in government."}, {"id": "2nhbx5", "body": "I am somewhat considering not to vote in 2015 in the UK.

It would simply be unrealistic to expect both groups to attain similar success.\n\nWhen you say it's the disadvantaged group's \"fault\", you are right that the group played a causal role in their choices; but there's a deeper, underlying factor that determines the group's decisions. The people you address in the title are not saying it's theoretically impossible for some individuals to succeed, or that some individuals have insurmountable barriers; it's more of an acknowledgement of the fact that if a group is disadvantaged to a far enough degree, then it guarantees that most of them will not see success for very complex reasons."}, {"id": "2ngx9z", "body": "I grew up in the UK to a poor family.

They didn't earn these better chances, but they are likely to be more successful than others. Is this fair? The existence of these tendencies is one of the complaints people have.\nAnother problem is that people can fall into destitution because of factors that are completely out of their control such as disease, injury and falling victim to crime. The wealthy are significantly less likely to be affected by each of these factors, again causing an unfair trend in favour of those born privileged.\n\nTo directly address the notion that 'the opportunity to succeed is available to anyone': what about people who are born into poor families who can't achieve academic success due to low natural ability? What about people who simply work hard but can't get good grades and didn't spend their time learning and improving skills that could be applied to work before they realised they can't perform well academically?\nYou could say that they could be successful, but just with a low probability. That's the problem: whether people succeed or not is influence to a large extent by uncontrollable, unpredictable factors and unfortunately people who don't have wealth, useful contacts, resources and general aptitude are less likely to be successful.\nOne could say success a result of the choices people make, but what influences these choices? People make choices based on many factors, particularly what they are taught, how they are conditioned, and what they have experienced.\n\n- I went to terrible city state schools. Ones where bullying was the norm and I had more fights than I can remember. \n\nThese pupils were born and raised in this culture. They haven't been shown how hard work can lead to success as all they see in society is what you did. You could argue that you were put in this environment and yet made the correct choice. But everyone is raised by their parents differently and has different experiences, so it's not surprising that a few (such as yourself) would deviate from the general mindset.\n\n- My peers at school were mostly from poor families who didn't work and claimed benefits.\n\nSo do you see how conditions and upbringing affect one's personality, fortune, and choices?\n\n- Now I clearly remember sitting in science class. Other kids would be hurling pencils and crunched up paper at the back of my head. They'd shout slurs like \"geek\", \" keeno\", \"you'll never get women\" at me. I'd power through and ignore them. There was a very \"anti geek\" atmosphere. The teacher also ignored them, going and standing outside when she got too stressed out.\n\nThey grew up in a subculture of rebellion and contempt for the smart. You were excluded by them, so your perspective on the world was inevitably going to be different from theirs as you had no reason to conform to the culture they promoted and would want to oppose it. The choices that you would make would be different from them.\n\n\n- I interviewed and got into medical school, where overnight I went from being a loser to being suddenly very popular for being smart.

Went from rags to riches. I bumped into the school bully ringleader stacking a shelf in Sainsburys the other day. He looked pretty depressed. I felt sad for him, but to be honest it was his choices in life that put him there.\n\nAnd what in his life caused him to make these choices?\n\n- It always annoys me when people who went through the same schooling system as me and didnt achieve anything with their lives complain about the 1% keeping them down, and how the rich are keeping the poor poor.\n\nThis complaint is related more with how the rich have disproportionate influence in politics (lobbying, corruption, etc) and can control what the poor (who are the consumers to media and business) have access to. The largest, wealthiest, businesses (which led to the '1%' having so much money) aim only to maximise profit and so they exploit the poor and vulnerable if it means less expenditure. this leaves the poor in worse conditions that previously.\n\n- It baffles me, actually. We live in a system where you can work hard and achieve anything. \n\nCan a man who lacks general aptitude become a successful doctor? Can someone who barely recovers from an awful disease in their 30s, without qualifications because they were running a small business, start from virtually nothing again and gain success?\n\nHard work definitely gives you a much better chance of being successful - that can't be denied. But it does not in any way guarantee achievements and success because there are many more factors that determine how far one will rise or fall in society.\n\n- Most of the rich are rich because someone creative and enterprising and hard working\n\nYes, most of them are. But were they more creative, enterprising and hard working than all others in society?  \n\n- some point in their family's history\n\nHow is this fair? Those who are rich have such wealth not because of their own hard work, but that of an ancestor? Is this not just luck?\n\n\n- Surely that is fair?\n\nIt's fortunate if you work hard and end up right at the top of society. But you can see many people working hard and not climbing so high - your father, for example.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2ngx9z", "body": "I grew up in the UK to a poor family.

Not everyone can be a doctor, there wouldn't even be that many places for people to get into the med schools in the first place.  But that was starting off with the most ridiculous scenario on purpose.  So let's assume instead that everyone goes into varying fields of their own interest, aiming for similarly prestigious and high-paying jobs.  Do all of these people get hired in their different fields?\n\nNot necessarily.  Even in today's real world, some fields might have appeared stable and in demand when you started studying, only to have the demand dry up once your degree finished.  Or maybe a field that does still have a high demand can't actually guarantee *everyone* a job when people naturally piled into that field, seeing it as a great route to success.  In this new utopia where *everyone* has seen the light of opportunity and is hustling to get those good jobs, there's going to be more and more disappointed people as only so many job openings are available.\n\nSo we're stuck with some people who have worked hard and studied and got great skills, but haven't been able to get into their chosen field right away.  They'll try and take what they can get for now, then.  Some will get lucky with jobs that at least still have good upward mobility, so they won't be too far set back.  But others will, through the luck of the draw, get knocked back again and again until they end up in some menial minimum wage job.\n\nNow, most mere *normal* people might start to feel a bit bitter or discouraged at this point, perhaps even to the point of developing an addiction or mental illness... but forget that, we're only dealing with people who know how to get on with life and overcome things now!  So everyone goes off to work at their various jobs... wait a minute, did I say everyone?\n\nDo you honestly think there could be 0% unemployment, even in a world like this?  I mean, even in our imperfect world full of losers and slackers, we see that even the most menial jobs have loads of people applying, desperate just to get *anything*.  It seems like even in our world, there isn't actually any shortage of people willing to work!  So in our new imaginary utopia... there's going to still be a lot of unemployed people.\n\nNow what if some misfortune falls on anyone who's in these lower strata?  An unexpected health issue, or perhaps an accident? Something that, despite all their honest efforts and hard work and smart frugal budgeting, has knocked them into a poverty trap?\n\nWould you have enough grace *now* to say they deserve some welfare and assistance, if you lived in this magical utopia where you can feel assured that there wasn't any moral character failings behind what got them there?\n\nOr would you convince yourself that this just can't happen, if they were *really* good people they'd have to find some way out of it, there just can't possibly be that many bad things happening to a good person?"}, {"id": "2ngx9z", "body": "I grew up in the UK to a poor family.

"}, {"id": "cmdkgmg", "body": "OK, it's more complicated than this -- issues this fundamental are complex on a level that would be unreasonable to try and explore in the space of a single internet thread -- but here's a hypothetical that I think might help illuminate some of the point. I want to lead by emphasizing that this is an imperfect metaphor, and the parts that are relevant to my point are about how emotional commitments can emerge implicitly, and how even materially harmless activities can cause emotional harm.\n\nSuppose you and your partner play tennis together, regularly. It was something you started doing early in your relationship. It's something neither of you had done very often before the relationship.\n\nThroughout your time together, playing tennis has been an emotionally important, intimate bonding experience. You know for sure that your partner sees your playing tennis together as a deeply personal and important part of your relationship.\n\n(The metaphor struggles at this point, because we don't have the same cultural feelings about tennis as we do about sex, but you can reasonably expect that your partner most likely brought to the relationship expectations that are common surrounding the activities you participate in. If tennis exclusivity were a common thing, it would be reasonable to anticipate that your partner might conceive of your tennis relationship in that way.)\n\nKnowing that, and knowing your partner would be hurt to discover that you don't see tennis the same way, you go out behind their back and play tennis with someone else.\n\nYour partner, when they find out, is going to be hurt by the discovery. As a person who's capable of empathy, you know that.\n\nYou could have talked to your partner about playing tennis with other people. You could have established as a relationship value that tennis exclusivity is something you're uncomfortable with. If you're uncomfortable with a relationship that's exclusive in that way, and your partner is uncomfortable with a relationship that isn't, that's a serious disagreement that might mean your relationship can't work.\n\nThere are clear analogues here with sex -- open relationships are a thing, and they are an honest and above-board way of having an intimate relationship without sexual exclusivity, in a way that isn't cheating.\n\nThe reason it's wrong is that you know going in that your partner expects to be able to trust you to hold their feelings in high regard when making decisions, but you're choosing to make decisions that you know will hurt them. It doesn't matter if there's no explicitly discussed or negotiated agreement. If you can reasonably anticipate that you're going to cause harm if you take an action, and you choose to take that action anyway, you hold meaningful responsibility for the ensuing harm.\n\nIn the case of cheating, that means choosing to betray your partner's trust.\n\nCheating is, pretty much by definition, the kind of sex that betrays trust. And while it's not automatically wrong to betray someone's trust (not to be all Godwin's Law but ratting out Hitler is probably a net moral good) in the context of a loving relationship, where the only thing gained by the betrayal is personal gratification, it's wrong."}, {"id": "2nglhd", "body": "Something that has perplexed me for years, even after I've been through a serious relationship, is the concept of \"cheating\".

But when you go look at the user reviews you will see that the majority of the most-agreed-with reviews give the movies low to mediocre scores, much lower than the 7/10 stars these movies seem to have. This is really misleading.\n\nI believe the give more weight for the most helpful or agreed reviews of movies or products by treating every user who agrees with a particular review's rating as additional votes of that same particular rating.\n\nex. a 3/10 review for a product with 100 people agreeing with this review should count as 101 different \"3/10\" ratings\n\nA review with 100 agreements from 100 users should not have the same weight to a score as a really late review that sits all the way in the back of the pile of reviews that no one has read or agreed with. Overall ratings need to be more representative of legitimate reviews instead of simply the majority.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

We have traits that mimic disorders but don't quite satisfy the DSM. \n\nI am bipolar. I doubt many on tumblr have pulled off the side of the road to both laugh and cry hysterically for 1/2 in their early 20's after someone raged on them. I literally could not control my own behavior. My illness is a disability. \n\nI've seen some tumblr posts and I see a lot of teenagers who are figuring out who they are. Their brain isn't even fully developed - most teens show symptoms of actual DSM disorders. \n\nThe thing I'm noticing today is a kind of celebration of victimhood. We've had a historical shift in value systems in America. We are deeply concerned with how people feel. I would say excessively, but anyways. \n\nThe problem becomes a sort of spiral of victimhood. Something innocuous happens; example: a tumblr-ite saw a cut pomegranate and asserted the person put a NSFW on it because it looked like something bloody. It triggered them. \n\nThey observe that people who had something negative happen to them; bullying or something and they observe the support and validation they get. So they mimic the behavior and get the same validation. This goes 'viral' and soon everyone chases the validation cataloging the most benign events as transgressions. \n\nTumblr-ites co-opted the word 'triggered', but they're in danger of watering down the word to the point of uselessness. 20 yrs ago the word entered the lexicon to describe a recall to past trauma. My mom is an incest survivor - her father sexually abused her. When I was younger I had to sit in on her support group. You should hear the shit these women had to put up with. They experience terrible trauma. The teens on tumblr maybe experienced something objectively less traumatic. But because of the spiral of the validation of victimhood, mountains are made out of mole hills. \n\nThis essentially strips the legitimacy of actual disorders. I don't think any of them have been in a place where they are actively breaking laws because the person feels something worse will happen and wants to be arrested to be confined. I have.

B is a lot easier if you're willing to abandon nihilistic materialism in favor of an alternate philosophy regarding less testable things like consciousness or morality. Here are some of my favorites:\n\n1. Always been partial to reincarnation. I was born once. Why can't it happen again?\n\n2. How \"you\" are defined is completely arbitrary. You switch out basically all your cells and molecules multiple times from birth to old age. If that doesn't kill \"you,\" actual death shouldn't.\n\n3. It's philosophically possible for your subjective experience to switch bodies with someone else. You wouldn't know, because that's not in your memory. You wouldn't act differently, because you're given the same past and situation. You could wake up a different (and living!) person each day.\n\n4. Who says time itself has to move forward? Just because memory builds up as time goes on doesn't mean we experience it in that order, it just seems that way from any point in time. We could be going in reverse and nobody would be any the wiser. \n\n5. Cyclical time is also possible, although quite awful if your life isn't very good. You get to experience your same life over and over again! Obviously you never get tired of it either.\n\n6. Sort of in the same vein, if you are big into the \"you are defined by your particular arrangement of matter,\" given the infiniteness of time, there are some views of the universe that would make it a near-certainty that matter rearranges itself into something resembling you again.\n\nGranted, a stubborn materialist won't accept any of these, but that's the thing about philosophy: it's all equally possible far as we know."}, {"id": "2ng16v", "body": "Dear r/changemyview,\n\nI don't expect this to be the usual fare for your sub as I actively want my view changed, as opposed to it being a challenge to change my view.

I've been a little obsessed in finding poetic ways to convey the idea that death isn't the end of existence for a couple of years.\n\nOne discussion I like involves horcruxes. In the Harry Potter universe, Voldemort, a character who could never experience love, decided that, in order to make himself immortal, he would destroy human lives to put his soul into objects, making them horcruxes. When those objects were destroyed and Voldemort's physical self died, all of his passion, beliefs, and plans died with him. His clan breaks apart. His genetic code disappears. He has no apprentice to continue his work.\n\nHarry, and any other wizard with a capacity for love, seek immortality by spreading their knowledge, experience, genetics, beliefs, and influences, so that when they die, the large net of people they invested in carry on their work. They put their soul into people, rather than objects, to sustain their impact after death. Every dead person who invested in others continues to affect the world long after death.\n\nThis explains a little bit why we have wars, battles, and squabbles over beliefs instead of strictly fighting for survival resources. Now that human evolution has well surpassed survival of our physical self, we fight for survival of our mental selves. Spreading genetic code takes second place to spreading knowledge and influence in many cases. Immortality doesn't mean living on in all cases, it means causing irreparable damage to the universe that leaves a mark. \n\nIf you aren't into Harry Potter, Jigsaw did the same thing in the Saw series. Once he got the date of his death, he worked to surpass that date by recruiting people to follow his work after death. Pretty much the same way anyone seeks immortality."}, {"id": "2ng16v", "body": "Dear r/changemyview,\n\nI don't expect this to be the usual fare for your sub as I actively want my view changed, as opposed to it being a challenge to change my view.

There is nothing that suggests otherwise and we have every reason to believe with our studies that consciousness is a result of our brain activity, not some ethereal ghost that interacts with our brain.\n\n&gt; that the previous statement sucks\n\nI don't necessary agree with this one. Though it would be very interesting if we had an afterlife, there are some interesting problems with it.\n\nDoes it last forever? If so, one would think that it might eventually get boring or less meaningful. If it doesn't last forever, how long does it last? 20 years? 100 years? Then what? Is it basically like Life 2.0? Wouldn't that kind of take away from the importance of *this life*?\n\nSometimes I wish there was an afterlife. It seems like it would be great to be able to meet people I never knew, or hang out with all my friends and family for all eternity. But do you know what? Death without an afterlife also gives us complete closure, and we don't need to worry about eternal punishment or someone escaping justice in the real world and enjoying a second life in the \"beyond\".\n\nWe go through the same stage that literally everything else in the Universe eventually goes through, from the smallest life to the largest stars. We begin to exist, we exist and then we no longer exist. Every living thing that has ever lived is either alive now or it has died and gone on to be part of the future. For most religions, they would say that EVERYTHING (except Humans) dies and goes on to be part of the future. Why should we be different? Isn't it *good* that we contribute to the constant cycle of existence? That we somehow don't have part of us *sucked out* to go on to an afterlife? That we are just taking our part and going with it as long as we can?\n\nPersonally, death without an afterlife doesn't scare me. I get to be part of a long chain of the cycle of life and death, and I'm not taking something out of it like a \"spirit\". I'm part of the unending cycle and walking the *same* steps that others have walked.\n\n&gt;technology won't help us out of it.\n\nI agree here. Technology won't help us out of it, but I don't think it should. I see death and the eternal slumber as inevitable. At least in my opinion, we should grow up to no longer have irrational fear for it. Technology probably won't help us GAIN an afterlife, but we can learn to accept and respect the fact that we won't have one, and live happier lives knowing that."}, {"id": "2ng16v", "body": "Dear r/changemyview,\n\nI don't expect this to be the usual fare for your sub as I actively want my view changed, as opposed to it being a challenge to change my view.

Many of these people have anywhere from little to zero formal education and no basis of which to pull themselves up \u2013 which is not a consequence of big multinational corporations but something big multinational corporations need to respect when collaborating with them to produce value.\n\nNo, it simply isn't. \n\nWages are based on the value of the ***work***, not the worker. That value is determined by the market, if it weren't everyone would make minimum wage.\n\nA person's \"need\" is not, and should not be, relevant to the employer as it pertains to wages.   \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Absolutely agree, I just think we disagree on the disparity between value provided and recompensation - in which I'd like some \"charity\" to circumvent market conditions where possible and where necessary. I think there are many opportunities in this world for employers and employees to have a more fair relationship, both ways and not to the detriment of economic growth.\n\nWhile I agree that there is both a time, and a place for charity, wages are neither. When you attempt to manipulate Supply &amp; Demand- no matter how benevolent your intentions, eventually it ***is*** going to bite you in the ass. \n\nIt's also largely unnecessary, as there are ways to work within the system to accomplish the same goal.   \n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Thanks if you took the time to read this!\n\nI read all messages I receive.

They will also seek out tax friendly investments like municipal bonds, which further reduces the capital available to enterprise. \n\nSome studies have suggested that tax revenue maxes out at approximately a 30% cap gains rate, after which point people either invest less or alter their behavior in such a way that revenues collected are less than they would have been without the rate increase.

There is a very good reason why it is lower than the general income tax, and it's about inflation.\n\n.\n\nLet's pretend, in 2003, you invested $10,000, and you sold it for $19,671.51 in 2013, ten years later. A tidy capital gain of $9,671.51. Now, if you pay the capital gains tax rate in the highest bracket (20%), you pay $1,934.20 in taxes. \n\nBut, really, that $10,000 investment ten years ago has the same value as ~$12,655 in 2013 dollars thanks to inflation (this is a rough estimate based upon BLS inflation rates).

Thus, you will see bridges like beams or arches without any triangles, but none without at least one rectangle.\n\n&gt;Triangles are versatile\n\nOk, you seem to be using a comparison of one class' general form to a specific form of another.
