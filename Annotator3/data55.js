The Concert for Valor is aiming to honor our veterans, not glorify or shine a positive light on the wars they fought in.  You mentioned some of the lineup; well there's Bruce Springsteen who has a decades-long history of protesting war, and Carrie Underwood who has sung about the loss of family members to war.  Eminem too has been highly critical of sending youth to war in his music.  \n\nThe concert itself is free, but on the event's website there is a long list of organizations to support which focus on veterans.  \n\nSure some people get carried away and turn what should be a day to honor veterans into more of a 4th of July-style celebration, but I've been a part of several Veterans Day ceremonies.  I've lain wreaths on the memorial.  I think for most people, any celebration on this day is done with the veterans in mind.  People go to restaurants and bars with their relatives who have made it back from war, or they honor their grandparents who fought overseas.  \n\nA fraction of people may bastardize the intent of the holiday, but that's true about nearly every holiday.

In most countries it is called Armistice Day or Remembrance Day (from hereon I will only use Armistice to avoid confusion with the US holiday of Memorial Day in May), while in the US it is called Veterans Day. I believe this distinction is important, and borderline insulting.\n\nNovember 11 1918 was the official end of World War I. The annual holiday was immediately proclaimed by most if not all participating nations, and has been marked as Armistice Day ever since. This was the case in the US until 1954, when it was changed to Veterans Day.\n\nNote that 1954 was the same year the words \"under god\" were added to the Pledge of Allegiance, and was the final year of Senator McCarthy's communist witchhunting (he was officially censured by the Senate in December 1954). Just like those events, I believe Veterans Day is a relic of the Cold War.\n\nSo what's the difference? Armistice Day is a solemn time to commemorate the end of war. It is in effect an anti-war holiday that reminds us of the most horrific and preventable waste of life committed by humans, specifically WWI. That war serves as a case study in why war is simply not worth fighting, and is therefore important to keep at the forefront of our collective memory.\n\nBy contrast, Veterans Day is effectively a celebration of war. It's celebrated in the most bombastic American way possible, with concerts, fireworks, and the like. Americans are expected to thank soldiers for their service year round, especially on November 11. In Armistice Day countries veterans are commemorated, but the attitude is one of sorrow (essentially saying we wish you hadn't had to suffer war) rather than appreciation.\n\nEven leaving aside how the day is marked, public consciousness of WWI in America is woeful. As a European American I am consistently astounded by how little Americans know about the war. After all, it was the third deadliest American conflict yet most people only know the name (and that's only because it's implied by WWII).\n\nTherefore Americans should go back to calling it Armistice Day, both to raise awareness of WWI and to have a day where we acknowledge that war is bad.\n\nIf we can't have Armistice Day, then Veterans Day should either be moved away from November 11 or canceled altogether. It's insulting to the WWI war dead to replace their holiday with a celebration of patriotism and nationalism, when that's exactly what WWI proved was bad.\n\nBy the way, please try and avoid turning this into a debate over whether veterans should be lauded or reviled. That CMV has been done to death and it's not what this is about. As I said above, I'm fine with Veterans Day taking place on some other date.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "2m0ifp", "body": "Today, November 11, is a holiday around the world. In most countries it is called Armistice Day or Remembrance Day (from hereon I will only use Armistice to avoid confusion with the US holiday of Memorial Day in May), while in the US it is called Veterans Day. I believe this distinction is important, and borderline insulting.\n\nNovember 11 1918 was the official end of World War I. The annual holiday was immediately proclaimed by most if not all participating nations, and has been marked as Armistice Day ever since. This was the case in the US until 1954, when it was changed to Veterans Day.\n\nNote that 1954 was the same year the words \"under god\" were added to the Pledge of Allegiance, and was the final year of Senator McCarthy's communist witchhunting (he was officially censured by the Senate in December 1954). Just like those events, I believe Veterans Day is a relic of the Cold War.\n\nSo what's the difference? Armistice Day is a solemn time to commemorate the end of war. It is in effect an anti-war holiday that reminds us of the most horrific and preventable waste of life committed by humans, specifically WWI. That war serves as a case study in why war is simply not worth fighting, and is therefore important to keep at the forefront of our collective memory.\n\nBy contrast, Veterans Day is effectively a celebration of war. It's celebrated in the most bombastic American way possible, with concerts, fireworks, and the like. Americans are expected to thank soldiers for their service year round, especially on November 11. In Armistice Day countries veterans are commemorated, but the attitude is one of sorrow (essentially saying we wish you hadn't had to suffer war) rather than appreciation.\n\nEven leaving aside how the day is marked, public consciousness of WWI in America is woeful. As a European American I am consistently astounded by how little Americans know about the war. After all, it was the third deadliest American conflict yet most people only know the name (and that's only because it's implied by WWII).\n\nTherefore Americans should go back to calling it Armistice Day, both to raise awareness of WWI and to have a day where we acknowledge that war is bad.\n\nIf we can't have Armistice Day, then Veterans Day should either be moved away from November 11 or canceled altogether. It's insulting to the WWI war dead to replace their holiday with a celebration of patriotism and nationalism, when that's exactly what WWI proved was bad.\n\nBy the way, please try and avoid turning this into a debate over whether veterans should be lauded or reviled. That CMV has been done to death and it's not what this is about. As I said above, I'm fine with Veterans Day taking place on some other date.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It tells us that the driving situation is safer in Germany when measured in deaths per mile which is a better metric than deaths per capita.  In regards to speed limits (or lack therof) it tells us that *at a minimum* higher speed limits don't increase the danger enough to offset the other advantages Germany may have.  The best case scenario for no speed limits is that Germany is actually more dangerous overall, but the higher speed limits actually decrease the danger enough to offset the additional danger.\n\nThe reality is probably somewhere in the middle with the higher speed limits having a negligible relationship to safety when compared to driver education, road conditions, car quality, etc.  "}, {"id": "clzst0r", "body": "Germany is allowing people to drive as fast as they like on most highways.

Sure she was married to John but she had an illustrious career as an artist before they were married. You're holding Yoko Ono who was a incredibly important artist in the New York Avant-Garde scene in the 60s to the standards of a pop/rock group.\n\nSure the Beatles dabbled in \"avant-garde\" but what they did was really only avant-garde in respect to what had been done in the rock/pop world.\n\nYoko Ono played a major role in uniting major artists of the time at her loft concerts. As well as her own work as a visual artist. She's been associated with some of the greatest composers of the time John Cage, La Monte Young, etc. \n\nJohn was interested in the Avant-Garde and essentially married one of it's most important figures. To the general public however, she didn't make music \"like The Beatles\" or even music that made sense in the Western tradition of pop. She was taken from an extremely niche scene and thrown into the world of people who wanted something accessible. It's no surprise she wasn't liked or understood.\n\nThe Beatles are probably the most important group of all time but they exist within certain genres and certain standards. Yoko existed in a different genre with different standards. Neither is better or worse than the other, simply different. You can't hold the Beatles to the standards of avant-garde composition and you can't hold Yoko Ono to the standards of the Beatles.

The other answers here have pretty much stuck to her music, but that's not necessary based on the wording of this CMV and it's not particularly prudent given her artistic career. As John Lennon famously put it, she's \"the world's most famous unknown artist: everybody knows her name, but nobody knows what she does.\" \n\nYoko Ono is a performance artist whose work goes substantially beyond her music. In particular, I would check out Cut Piece (wikipedia's description: \"Ono was an explorer of conceptual art and performance art. A seminal performance work is Cut Piece, first performed in 1964 at the Sogetsu Art Center in Tokyo. It had one simple but destructive verb as its instruction: 'Cut.' Ono executed the performance by walking to the center of a stage in her best garments and inviting the audience to cut off her clothing, casually sitting on the floor legs tucked underneath, and audience members would begin.\") and Grapefruit (again, wikipedia's description: \"Another example of her conceptual art includes her book of instructions titled Grapefruit. First published in 1964, the book includes surreal, Zen-like instructions to be completed in the mind of the reader. One example is 'Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies.]\". She was a pioneer in performance art. \n\n(Maybe you don't care for performance art in general, and that's fine. You see these works and they don't speak to you. There are huge movements in art that I don't personally care for. I don't happen to care for the bauhaus. I'm honestly not particularly fond of impressionism. But I wouldn't conclude that Monet sucks just because it's not up my alley!)\n\nAs a final note-- as much as you may not personally care for her music, she's directly inspired a huge range of musicians ranging from the B-52s to Sonic Youth.

If people did not have the right to live, then the government would not care who was killed. So whether the fetus is a person matters for determining what interest the government has in protecting it. \n\nYou're arguing semantics. I explained the two competing interests in the legal argument (the woman and the government).  You replied \"if a fetus is a person, then certainly it's right to live plays into the equation.\" As I explained earlier, no, it doesn't. People on the internet might argue over whether a fetus is alive or is a person, but in the legal world, it comes down to those two competing interests: the mother's right to govern her own body, and the government's right to protect a potential, future citizen. It isn't a citizen now, but should it be born, it will be--hence the government's stake in it. Obviously the government has concerns for the welfare of the fetus/future citizen, but that doesn't change anything I've stated. \n\n&gt;I am well aware that legally fetuses are not \"citizens,\" but the question is on what moral grounds is that determination based.\n\nNo, that's not what the question is. You're asking about viability and I'm explaining why its important--but to understand that means understanding the legal aspect of the issue (in particular, that the two competing interests are the mother and the government.)  If you want to argue whether a fetus SHOULD BE considered a citizen, that's a completely different topic.\n\n&gt;As for your 100% reliance argument, my question is why does biological dependence govern whether the person can be killed or not?\n\nBecause since the fetus is relying only on the mother (which has numerous changes/consequences for the mother), only she is directly affected by it, so only she gets the right to say whether the source causing the changes in her body gets to continue using her body. \n\n&gt; If a mother and her child live alone in the woods somewhere, that child is 100% dependent on the mother to survive\n\nBecause once you're a parent, it's not like you have no remedy if you don't want to be a parent. If you don't want to be a parent anymore, you can relinquish custody to another relative or the government. But if you choose to continue being a parent, you're legally responsible for that child.\n"}, {"id": "2lzy97", "body": "The crux of the argument is whether the fetus is a person. I think most people would agree that if it is a person, it would be immoral to kill it. This is why few people support partial birth abortions -- at that point, the fetus is pretty well considered a baby. What does the fetus's ability to survive without depending on the mother have anything to do with it? We don't use that as a measure for whether other people are alive -- newborns can't survive on their own very long. Conjoined twins may not be able to survive without the other. These are certainly people. Viability seems to me an arbitrary concept, especially given the changing medical technology that makes a fetus viable earlier and earlier. If only a viable fetus is a person, then a fetus at the same stage of development would be a considered a person today, but not 30 years ago?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That argument is only used for if the woman is still necessary for it's survival.\n\nIt all is based around the willingness of the woman to allow her body to be used for survival. If the fetus is viable, it can live without her (technically) and therefore it is not at the woman's digression if it can be a life. Rather if it isn't viable, and the woman doesn't want it. It is effectively a parasite to that person that some laws want to require her to bring to term. (please don't crucify me for terminology, I'm just trying to be clear).\n\nThe fact of pregnancy is that it actually causes a lot of havoc and harm on a woman's body that can take years to heal, if it ever does. It physically changes them permanently. Not to mention the incredible hardships it causes to a woman's independence. You can't lift heavy things, in later months you have to urinate every 15 minutes, you can't sleep on your stomach, you cramp and it can cause severe stress on your back. A Woman's hips physically move and become wider, permanently, meaning that pre-pregnancy clothes might not fit at all and she would have to re-buy clothing for after and during. What if she wasn't well educated and had to work in labor jobs. You aren't agile, you can't maneuver, you can't lift and you can't fit in many spaces meant for the average adult.\n\nThese are all things that people tend not to take into consideration. Blame doesn't seem to be your focus, so I am making the argument that viability isn't a perfect indicator. But not much of anything concerning humanity is perfect. But it's a moral compromise for those that are on both sides that seems to be the most agreeable of all the points in which it could be defined. It allows for a reasonable amount of time for discovery of pregnancy to decisions, without having a fully-formed child as collateral late in the game. \n\nAlso, you mention conjoined twins, and while politically they are considered separate, biologically they are considered one entity until they are separated. It could also be argued, that while having two brains and personalities, if they share organs, neither one of them has autonomy, techinically, even if one can more easily live separated than the other. So it really isn't an applicable scenario to apply to a definition of \"life\", because that situation is far out of the norm.\n\nCheesy metaphor: It's like trying to define curly fries by describing the one random french fry in the bunch.

Just see how many tables a person is working (and the management is staffing people to work about 3 - 5 tables at once depending on the kind of place it is. Determine how long you stayed at the restaurant, and what kind of restaurant ($, $$, $$$ or $$$$), and how many tables this person is working. Take estimated hourly rate for that type of restaurant, divide it by number of tables, and you get your tables portion of the hourly rate. Multiply it by hours you were there.\nExample:\n$$$ restaurant = $25 per hour\nNumber of tables = 3 tables\nHours at restaurant = 1.5 hours\nMy tip should be (25/3)*1.5=$12.50 total\nif my bill was $120 that is an 10% tip\nIf my bill was $62.50 that is a 20% tip\nIf my bill was $250 that is a 5% tip.\nThis brings waiters into the same work world as the rest of us.\nIf they work at a restaurant for 5 days a week, 8 hours a day for 50 weeks a year at the example restaurant, they make $52,000 a year. For a job without a degree required, that is above average.\nBecause if they work at 20% tips at these restaurants they will be making:\n$ restaurant with avg table bill = $20, at 3 tables an hour at 20% tip = $12 an hour = $24000 annual not counting pay from restaurant\n$$ restaurant with avg table bill = $50, at 3 tables an hour at 20% tip = $30 an hour = $60000 annual not counting pay from restaurant\n$$$ restaurant with avg table bill = $100, at 3 tables an hour at 20% tip = $60 an hour = $120000 annual not counting pay from restaurant\n$$$$ restaurant with avg table bill = $200, at 3 tables an hour at 20% tip = $120 an hour = $240000 annual not counting pay from restaurant.\nShould a waiter at a four star restaurant make a quarter million a year!!! What is he a surgeon!!!!\nNUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nAnd I know people will say waiters don't work full time, but that is not the consumers problem, then the pay should go down, as part time workers generally get less in the work world.

Howard Zinn's book is made up of a wide array of secondary sources taken oftentimes out of context to fulfill this delusion in his head that the United States has this history of powerful cartoonish villains defeating the poor and helpless \"little guy\" every time he gets a chance. At times his analysis is correct and has merit, I actually enjoyed his chapter on the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, but for the most part he interjects bizarre marxists arguments into arenas he clearly has no business being involved in. I particularly hated his chapter on WW2 and how it was a grand conspiracy on the part of the allied leaders to make money, ignoring the fact that the German and Japanese governments were murderous and committed disgusting acts. The only value I could see in the book is that it shows how \"the fringe\" views history. But if we are gonna see how \"the fringe\" views history, why don't we read some Glenn Beck?

Brendan Behan once observed that whoever hated America hated mankind, and hatred of mankind is the dominant tone of Zinn's book... He lavishes indiscriminate condemnation upon all the works of man \u2014 that is, upon civilization, a word he usually encloses in quotation marks.[16]"}, {"id": "clzn46v", "body": "There are further criticisms  on this page.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States#Critical_reception"}, {"id": "clzn46v", "body": "There are further criticisms  on this page.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States#Critical_reception"}, {"id": "clzzaq3", "body": "Of course, there are criticisms on the Wikipedia page but these are not your criticisms.

Our understanding is constantly evolving and there is no complete agreement on any one historical narrative amongst historians.  Sure, they may agree on facts, but there is more to understanding history than placing events on a timeline.  Interpretation of those events varies wildly between different respected historians.  A part of the process is other historians objecting to interpretations or characterizations of sources and trying to assert their own theories.  This is true of every academic work.  \n\nYou don't seem to taking into account the hundreds of prominent historians that require this book be read by their undergrads.  Some of them might even be the same ones that published criticism of it!  On the whole the book is accurate enough to be a useful teaching aid.\n\nThe most dangerous thing in the teaching of recent history is using teaching materials that pretend to be a completely unbiased accurate representation of exactly what happened.  That simply doesn't exist.  Every work of history is biased in some way, intentionally or not.  The solution is to expose yourself to as much bias as possible and develop an understanding of all of them as long as they are well supported factually.  \n\nYou also didn't respond to my earlier point so I'll say it again:  if your take away from Zinn's bit on WWII is \"our leaders are all scumbags trying to make money by the deaths of American soldiers\", the problem is you, first and foremost.  That is not an accurate representation of his presentation of WWII.  Before you can criticize an academically popular published book of history you need to understand it comprehensively, and I really don't think you do.  \n\nA more nuanced take might be \"though the war later took on grand themes of good vs evil, our entrance into it and overarching strategy was primarily motivated by national interest and economics rather than altruism\" with maybe a side of \"sometimes leaders interpreted 'national interest' to mean 'corporate interests' at the expense of the common man\", though that still isn't totally accurate.  And I don't think you're going to find a tremendous amount of disagreement with those statements amongst a lot of historians.  The facts do not support the premise that the US entered WWII just to be the saviors of China and Europe, no matter how nasty the Axis powers may have been.

My kids call him Daddy.\n\n&gt;And you liberals, the way you protest against sending us to fight people who fuck goats, practice slavery, commit genital mutilation on little girls, and blow up schools, that also is just the bee\u2019s knees. We really appreciate your \u201cWhere are the WMDs, Bush?\u201d bumper stickers, especially those of us being treated for exposure to mustard, sarin, dioxin and chlorine gas.\n\n&gt;So you\u2019ve done your part \u2014 don\u2019t feel guilty about turning your attention elsewhere, the way a small boy gets distracted from Dora by a lollipop. It was bound to happen.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t expect you to go out and make any kind of effective change to the VA. I\u2019m just happy that for a brief while, you kind of, sort of, gave a fuck about us.\n\n&gt;That was just great.\n\n&gt;Thank you, America. Plus, next week is Veteran\u2019s Day, which will be cool. I need a new mattress.\n\nI think there's a strong argument to be made that Americans indulge in this over-the-top, awkward and uncomfortable veneration because they feel guilty.  I think they feel guilty because they know they're too lazy and apathetic to deal with any of the problems with the VA, veteran homelessness or veteran suicide.  They feel guilty because deep down, they know how criminally uninformed they are; I'd wager 99% of them have no idea where Marjah, Anbar or Helmand are, who we're actually fighting in Afghanistan nor do they have anything approaching an accurate narrative of either of the wars we've been fighting for the last decade.  I know that in 2011, people were surprised I was going to Afghanistan *because they didn't realize there was still a war going on*.\n\nThis over-the-top patriotism is a salve for the conscience, but I can't really complain about the worship part.  If you're going to ignore friends of mine who've killed themselves, forget the problems with the VA after a few seconds of headshaking, wholly ignore the wars themselves (whether you're for or against them), take no interest in how congress spends money on the military...I guess you can buy me dinner (while making sure that everyone know you're doing it and can see what a great guy you are) if it makes you feel better.  It *is* better than nothing."}, {"id": "cm0dmvt", "body": "I think you made some really good points, but in quoting the guy at Duffleblog, I have serious issue with this:\n\n&gt;We really appreciate your \u201cWhere are the WMDs, Bush?\u201d bumper stickers, especially those of us being treated for exposure to mustard, sarin, dioxin and chlorine gas.\n\n[Yes, all of which were there in Iraq and under UN inspection.

They were stocks of chemical weapons that the US government should have *known* existed, and its the fault of the military leadership for not providing proper equipment to deal with such things and not trying to prevent soldiers from coming into contact with it.\n\nI agree it is horrific that soldiers are dealing with the repercussions of that, but don't fucking blame liberals who are still pissed off that we went to war with a country on *demonstrably false pretenses.*  It's kind of a slap in the face to act like we are dicks because we are *asking for accountability for soldiers who have been burned by the government.*  That's why I care about there being no WMD's, because I feel like the military was being  *exploited* to secure oil rights in the region, and had very little to do with the non-existent WMD's that were so central to why we invaded.  So when I read about young men whose lives are ruined because the government did very little to prevent them from being harmed from coming into contact with chemical weapons agents, I get angry *because I care,* not because I am lazy and apathetic.  I'm so sorry that I want our soldiers to be treated with dignity and respect and that demanding accountability from the people who *abuse* our soldiers apparently offends you.\n\n&gt; I think they feel guilty because they know they're too lazy and apathetic to deal with any of the problems with the VA, veteran homelessness or veteran suicide.\n\nThese are precisely things I care about.  It bothers me every day how many people dismiss the homeless but then turn around and praise our troops, completely ignoring how many of our troops our homeless.  It is fucking *baffling* to me that people can not put those two together and realize that by shitting on homeless people they are shitting on a large number of veterans.\n\nWhether wars are wrong or right and whether veterans are heroes or not, they are putting their lives on the line for something they believe in.  That's something very few have the balls to do.  It's not the grunt soldiers fault if he is thrown into a war built on false pretenses, and we can see the heroic deeds of individuals, but perhaps those people would not have had to be heroic for their friends or the towns where you helped rebuild if 1. we didn't go over into a war built on false pretenses to begin with, and 2. we hadn't gone the \"shock and awe\" route and destroyed a huge amount of infrastructure in the country before we went in.  The main reason you had to be there to help increase quality of life was because in the first hours of the war, we did everything we could to reduce quality of life so the enemies couldn't effectively organize.\n\nBeing heroic isn't something to sneeze at, but asking the question of:  Was it right to put them in that situation to begin with?  Has everything to do with *respect* for the soldiers and the fact they're willing to lay their lives on the line.  Asking for accountability so we can address things like problems in the VA, veteran mental illness, suicide and homeless rates, is absolutely because we give a damn, *not* because we think we are so high and mighty because we are anti-war.  If the US had been involved in any *legitimate conflict* since the end of World War 2, I would take it more seriously, but the US has a long history of abusing its military for political and economic ends, not for the benefit of the people at home, and certainly not for the benefit of those whose boots are on the ground.\n\nSo thank you for your post, but please don't disparage the people who actually *do* give a damn about you by acting like we're just a bunch of nutjob anti-war liberals who have no idea what is going on.  I know what is going on and it sickens me that you and others like you were exploited in modern wars.  It sickens me even more that defense spending fully takes up half of the entire spending in this country, yet we can't find the money to fix the VA, or give veterans decent enough benefits so that they *don't* end up homeless, or adding reasonable mental health help to the VA, or fixing that the VA still acts as though its a male-centered organization, despite needing to cater to women, which puts a lot of military servicewomen in a tough position when their health issues are ignored.\n\nI hope you can see I do not intend to disparage you, the work you did, or anything else, but rather, I'm mostly concerned with accountability from people higher up the chain in fixing problems for veterans.  Without accountability, things won't change.  So, yes, I support you but I can do it while demanding accountability from Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz et. al. for how much they have screwed the military.\n\nAm I wrong for having issues with things like this?:\n\n\n* Bush Administration cuts $1.5 billion from military family housing. The Bush Administration cut $1.5 billion for military family housing, despite Department of Defense statistics showing that in 83,000 barracks and 128,860 family housing units across the country are below standard.

Despite the war efforts of America's National Guard and Reserve Members, the Bush Administration announced in October 2003 its formal opposition to give the 1.2 million Guard and Reserve members the right to buy health care coverage through the Pentagon's health plan. One out of every five Guard members lacks health insurance.

The Bush Administration's 2004 budget cut $172 million of impact aid funding. Impact aid funding assists school districts by making up for lost local tax revenue from tax-exempt property, such as military bases. These education cuts will especially affect school-age children of troops serving in Iraq who reside on military bases.

I don't say that by way of accusation; my point is that I don't really care who fucked it up.  This need for \"accountability\" stands in direct political opposition to what actually needs to be done.  What was (and is) necessary was the participation and interest of the American people *in what was actually going on in the wars and within the military*.  What the whole country needed was a frank discussion and purposeful action, it got one party that accepted without question (Republicans) and one party that washed its hands of the whole thing (the Democrats).\n\nThe people themselves...really didn't do much of anything.  There was no sacrifice in support of the effort or strong protest against it.  Most Americans just sat there and did nothing; the only excuse they could seem to muster was \"it's really hard to affect the political system\".  If the supposed heartfelt passion on either side had actually translated into action, then there would have been change.  Given that there really was no meaningful change for over a decade, I can only conclude that people of all political stripes were (generally) either lazy or lying.  Of course there are exceptions on both sides, but I don't think the American people have made a particularly good showing over the past decade.\n\nLet me also make this clear: I really, honestly do appreciate your concern about these issues.  I don't want any of this to come off as me attacking you for what you believe or blaming liberals for everything that has gone on.  I'm just trying to clarify what I think the writer was trying to say and laying out the criticisms that I think apply to *most* Americans.\n\n&gt;These are precisely things I care about. It bothers me every day how many people dismiss the homeless but then turn around and praise our troops, completely ignoring how many of our troops our homeless. It is fucking baffling to me that people can not put those two together and realize that by shitting on homeless people they are shitting on a large number of veterans.\n\nI have a problem with this not because I necessarily disagree with you, but because this is another thing that both sides do in their own way: co-opt veterans to serve their preexisting political agenda.  The original article does something similar, suggesting that the problem with the VA should be addressed as part of universal healthcare.  *That is nonsense.*  Universal healthcare is a relatively controversial idea in the US and may or may not continue to develop, whereas VA healthcare was promised to veterans as a condition of their service.  Problems with the VA are not arguments for universal healthcare, just as the safety of servicemen should not be invoked to silence criticism of defense spending by conservatives.\n\nI can't consider something to be wholly genuine compassion or concern when it's inextricably entwined with an agenda that was already there; especially when that association necessarily subordinates the concerns of veterans.  Veterans are homeless and killing themselves in large part because society failed to deliver on promises of medical treatment.  I sympathize with the homeless and I think we should help them, but there is a difference between helping people when we can and delivering on promises we already made.\n\nSo I really am glad that you care and I believe you when you say the things you do.  If you've been honest, then this article and my post aren't directed at you.  They are directed at people who say some of the same things that you do, but never do anything about any of the problems they see.

Of course there are exceptions on both sides, but I don't think the American people have made a particularly good showing over the past decade.\n\nLet me also make this clear: I really, honestly do appreciate your concern about these issues.  I don't want any of this to come off as me attacking you for what you believe or blaming liberals for everything that has gone on.  I'm just trying to clarify what I think the writer was trying to say and laying out the criticisms that I think apply to *most* Americans.\n\n&gt;These are precisely things I care about. It bothers me every day how many people dismiss the homeless but then turn around and praise our troops, completely ignoring how many of our troops our homeless. It is fucking baffling to me that people can not put those two together and realize that by shitting on homeless people they are shitting on a large number of veterans.\n\nI have a problem with this not because I necessarily disagree with you, but because this is another thing that both sides do in their own way: co-opt veterans to serve their preexisting political agenda.  The original article does something similar, suggesting that the problem with the VA should be addressed as part of universal healthcare.  *That is nonsense.*  Universal healthcare is a relatively controversial idea in the US and may or may not continue to develop, whereas VA healthcare was promised to veterans as a condition of their service.  Problems with the VA are not arguments for universal healthcare, just as the safety of servicemen should not be invoked to silence criticism of defense spending by conservatives.\n\nI can't consider something to be wholly genuine compassion or concern when it's inextricably entwined with an agenda that was already there; especially when that association necessarily subordinates the concerns of veterans.  Veterans are homeless and killing themselves in large part because society failed to deliver on promises of medical treatment.  I sympathize with the homeless and I think we should help them, but there is a difference between helping people when we can and delivering on promises we already made.\n\nSo I really am glad that you care and I believe you when you say the things you do.  If you've been honest, then this article and my post aren't directed at you.  They are directed at people who say some of the same things that you do, but never do anything about any of the problems they see.  They are directed at people across the political spectrum who more interested in identity politics than in treating war and veterans properly."}, {"id": "cm0sm9f", "body": "I want you to know, in no way shape or form was your post combative, and I must express deep appreciation for being so even-keeled.\n\nI really can't find anything else to say, because I generally agree with your points herein, and I also agree that both sides of the political fence are at fault.  (Don't even get me started on Obama and his complete inability to not just follow through with accountability for torture, but rather that he just took the Bush plan and ran with it, as much as he likes to pretend he didn't.  Like the whole Net Neutrality thing today.  Do you really care, or are you just paying lip service since the guy you appointed to run the FCC is obviously going to reject your proposal (and already has!).)\n\nSeriously, while I would love to see universal healthcare, I think you're absolutely right that before that difficult conversation even *begins* to happen, solving the problems at the VA and treating our veterans with *real* respect, not just lip-service, is absolutely something that must begin to happen.  We owe them that much because we *promised* them that much.\n\nAs for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, I never actually had much problem with deploying to Afghanistan, since that at least made sense.  I never understood why we backed off and pulled our troops out when we had Osama cornered in the mountains (although I'm sure there's probably logistical and tactical reasons that I'm unfamiliar with, having not served.), and as such was really only bothered by Iraq, because it just seemed so pointless.  Nevertheless, you are absolutely right, complaining about how we shouldn't have been there to begin with won't solve any problems or make the war go away.  I just get upset because there was no after-the-fact accountability for it, just like there continues to be no real accountability for torture (or the fact that the 9/11 Commission heavily relied on information gained through torture, leaving it heavily suspect in terms of being worthwhile, in my opinion.) or warrantless wiretapping (I know it's technically legal now, but it wasn't when they started it, and they just retroactively changed the laws to make it legal, which I think should have shocked and appalled everyone in the nation.).  Both parties are complicit in this.  They both passed the PATRIOT Act (many without bothering to read it), they both continue to wage fear-mongering on both sides of the political aisle, and they both refuse to talk about real issues instead of talking in sound-bites for the media to regurgitate.\n\nAnyway, thanks again so much for your thoughtful and enlightening response.

I need to point out this particular passage before I get accused of being a traitor or something of the sort, \"Reviewing the research proving cruelty and mendacity within law enforcement and the military, and reading the stories of trauma and tragedy caused by officers and soldiers, does not mean that no cop or troop qualifies as a hero, but it certainly means that many of them are not heroes.\"\n\nEdit: Thanks to all who've responded.  I enjoyed the conversation.  It's certainly helped me understand the complexities involved in this issue.  I will never fully understand war.  It's something that I hope I will never need to personally experience.  I hope that a day will come when none of us need to experience it.  Although I still think that soldiers are morally responsible for their actions regardless of whether they are being ordered by superiors, I also have come to realize that I was being hypocritical.  Just as some soldiers do bad things, some do good.  We should condemn the former while celebrating the latter.  It's just that holidays like this seem to ignore this distinction and you get immediately labeled as unpatriotic if you point it out.
