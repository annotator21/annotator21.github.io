Right here in CMV, actually. Essentially, these are judgments about a person's character or relative worth based on a single aspect, habit, or behavior that can be easily observed.

I have a very strong suspicion that you would take exception to such a judgment. And worse, that person is being judgmental about something that's not even a real thing--yes, the generally accepted spelling of the word only has a single e, but some dictionaries list the spelling you use as an alternative.

You're already dealing with some of the disadvantages of having children early. However, some people prefer to front-load their fun, often for good reason.  Backpacking through Europe is probably something best done in the early-mid 20s instead of in your 40s.  Certain kinds of sports are best practiced when young as well, and can be dangerous later in life (especially if they've been training less due to children).  \n\nAlso, investing long hours into your career early typically has greater payoffs long term than later investment.  People who can't invest the long hours early on due to children are going to be at a disadvantage relative to those who did their entire careers.  For many people, waiting until mid-career (about mid-30s) to have children is a far superior economic decision.  Having kids later is also easier because you have a greater ability to negotiate flexible schedules and time off.   \n\nLastly, marriages and relationships generally, are statistically way less stable before 25.  So waiting until 25 to start thinking about marriage is probably best for relationship stability, but would mean that kids at 30 is probably the best you're going to do (Meet someone at 25, date/engaged 2 years, married a year or two before start trying, takes about 6 months for the average couple to get pregnant).  If there are any difficulties finding someone, getting pregnant, becoming career stable, etc. the person will take even longer to have kids.

It used to be 35 was considered too old and high risk.   I believe that number is closer to 45 now.

I lived in a camper for 2 months going from one national park to another.  I earned two college degrees. I helped to found a nonprofit charity.

Age is only a number.   I have a few friends in their 70s who still ride their horses or work on their farms.   I know one at least in her 60s who jousts and does competitive dressage.   It's all in how you take care of yourself mentally and physically.\n\n\n\n&gt;I'm aware that every person will have their individual views on this based on experiences and influences. I would just like to see if I can be made to believe otherwise and if I should put off having children once I'm done with school and at a stable point in my career.\n\nStatistically people are more financially secure in their 30s and 40s than in their 20s.  This allows for more resources and opportunities for kids.  Because I waited,  I not only have a home but the mortgage is paid off.  All my schooling is done.  All my time and money can go to my daughter's needs.   It was important for me to stay at home with her.   I want to spend as much time with her when she is little because she'll grow up so fast.  Maybe not everyone has those priorities but my point is that with financial security the woman has the choice.\n\nKids are challenging and some 20 year olds aren't quite adults themselves mentally.   Given the choice I think the kids will do better when raised by mentally adult parents.

But sometimes young people don't know what it is they don't know . What's the harm in waiting?\n\nI believe there is no one right answer.  People need to do what's best for their future family based on their own situation\n\nI believe the only thing that can be a big mistake is for a young women who isn't sure what she wants out of life has a child for the wrong reasons.  Maybe she would've decided parenthood wasn't right for her at all if she waited and decided her bigger plan in life.   There is so much pressure for women to have kids by a certain time, but social pressure is the wrong reason a woman should get pregnant.

I actually don't know how to write this, since I am really scared.\n\nI am 23 years old, studying IT in Germany. I've never looked much TV, sometimes Sci-Fi, sometimes documentations and so on, but I didn't watch news regularly when I was like 10-18 years old. Only occasionally, like on 9/11. I stopped watching TV completely (besides online streaming of series, movies that I like etc.) and didn't watch any news anymore and just read what was in my Facebook news feed and what my friends told me. There were longer periods where I only experienced the world close to me - my school, friends, video games, music concerts, lately my work and so on. I didn't actually know what happened in the world for months sometimes. But then, I am visiting my parents or grandparents where news are like 12 hours a day. Experiencing that did something to me. It scares the shit out of me. People around me, family, friends, don't react the way I'd usually expect them to. It's like they are used to a loop of death over and over again. There is murder in neighborhood, suicide bombs in Gaza, rapes in India, and all that like 20 times a day. I cannot imagine that a normal human being would not either break or become very distant emotionally? But that were all still bearable...\n\nEver since 9/11 and Iraq, and even more so since ISIS and the Ukraine crisis something changed. The news are way more about displays of strength, politicians promising safety, military power on borders, about how evil \"everyone else\" (Putin and co.) are, how \"we should be solidary in times of great uncertainty\" and what not. For all I know, seemingly all governments act like Hitler in 1936; if you remember he talked about peace in public and in the back rooms he discussed rebuilding the army. Nearly every citizen is now a potential terrorist - that's just like all those years ago.\n\nI cannot imagine that Americans, Islamists, Russians, Europeans, Chinese or anyone else could want a new war, not even governments, not even weapon manufacturers, but the situation seems so strained that something as small as shooting a prince in 1914 could again be the last straw. I am observing that people like my grandparents, who are exposed to news like all time, didn't feel a change - I guess it's like a frog in cold and hot water. I am jumping into hot water, while their water was heating over time.\n\nI could envision some small accident in Ukraine, a few precision bombs fall and it won't get reported, nobody but the highest officials and some well-informed troops will know about it, but Putin takes it seriously and sends scout units. Those are getting captured by NATO troops and whoops, both sides already did an \"act of hostility\" with war declaration impending. It could happen tomorrow. Then what was thought to be prevented by \"stopping\" the Cold War could become reality: Nukes. And probably biological and chemical weapons too. Or maybe some economic crash and then the states close their borders, which worses things even more? Mass hunger which leads to real terrorist groups? I don't know, but I'd really like some words of hope from you.

Granted, I'm pretty isolated over here in America. However, I did grow up during the Cold War, and at some point I had to just accept that whatever happens, the only thing I can do is control my own actions and decisions. I can't make Obama or Reagan or Putin or Gorbachev or anyone do anything. All I can do is react to emergent situations. Until such situations arise, sitting around worrying about it is just a waste of emotional energy.\n\nWhen I asked my parents about the Cuban Missile Crisis, they just shrugged their shoulders. \"Eh, what could I do about it? I went to work, paid my bills, cooked my dinner, life went on.\" During the Blitz of London, people still went to school and work during the day and huddled in air raid shelters at night. The streets of Israel [aren't empty](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rachel-baruch/israel-rocket-attacks_b_5591904.html) even when tensions are high. That's pretty much what happens during war, to a lesser or greater extent. People get displaced due to bombings and troop movements, yes, absolutely. Sometimes civilians get caught in the crossfire. That's all true. But until it's actually happening, what can you do about it? How does fear and worry prepare you for such a situation?\n\nPeople like you and me are pretty privileged, and so we can't imagine how people who live in Mexico handle the insane cartel-fuelled violence going on in that country. We can't imagine what it would be like to watch a Hamas rocket be intercepted by the Iron Dome right over our heads. We have no idea how the people of Afghanistan or Iraq can deal with living in a war zone. But there are still people alive in Europe today who have clear memories of living under constant threat, and they're still here to talk about it. Hell, Japan is still here, and they had two nuclear bombs explode in country.\n\nConsider the inevitability of a large asteroid hitting earth and creating widespread devastation. What would be the point of worrying about that until it's an all-consuming fear that interferes with your daily life? Asteroids hit the earth, wars happen, some animals (people included) will survive, some won't.\n\nPeople can come into this thread and write comforting things about the unlikelihood of war in general or nuclear war in particular. Most of them will probably be true.

Nearly every citizen is now a potential terrorist - that's just like all those years ago.\n\nI cannot imagine that Americans, Islamists, Russians, Europeans, Chinese or anyone else could want a new war, not even governments, not even weapon manufacturers, but the situation seems so strained that something as small as shooting a prince in 1914 could again be the last straw. I am observing that people like my grandparents, who are exposed to news like all time, didn't feel a change - I guess it's like a frog in cold and hot water. I am jumping into hot water, while their water was heating over time.\n\nI could envision some small accident in Ukraine, a few precision bombs fall and it won't get reported, nobody but the highest officials and some well-informed troops will know about it, but Putin takes it seriously and sends scout units. Those are getting captured by NATO troops and whoops, both sides already did an \"act of hostility\" with war declaration impending. It could happen tomorrow. Then what was thought to be prevented by \"stopping\" the Cold War could become reality: Nukes. And probably biological and chemical weapons too. Or maybe some economic crash and then the states close their borders, which worses things even more? Mass hunger which leads to real terrorist groups? I don't know, but I'd really like some words of hope from you. There never was a single generation not living in war or in fear of war their whole life span, in all human history.\n\nSincerely.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you take that little phrase 'no relation' and take that to literally mean 'no relation at all' then obviously it would be wrong. But I've never heard anyone articulate such a view - values at least exist as thoughts which exist in the mind, which is a fact of reality. That isn't the issue here.\n\n&gt; ...the fact that living entities exist and function necessitates the existence of values and of an ultimate value which for any given living entity is its own life.\n\nAgain, the facts of existence may necessitate that there would be living beings that hold *the belief in values*. We're not discussing whether or not people *do* believe in values, but whether they *should*, or whether there can be a 'should' at all. Are the *values themselves* proven by the fact that people ('necessarily') believe in them? Can they be said to exist? For one, this is akin to arguing that because there are people that believe in God that therefore God is proven, and secondly if someone could please explain any other way that values exist other than in the mind I'd like to hear it. If that really is all that Rand is arguing - that values exist as beliefs in the mind - even that they *necessarily would* - then, fine. But it's not a very interesting argument because everyone knows that. The question is whether such a belief is useful, descriptive, meaningful in any way. \n\n&gt; Thus the validation of value judgments is to be achieved by reference to the facts of reality. The fact that a living entity is, determines what it ought to do. So much for the issue of the relation between \u201cis\u201d and \u201cought.\u201d\n\nSorry, Ayn. You haven't achieved what literally every philosopher throughout history has failed to do and gotten to an ought from an is within a short paragraph. God, there's so many problems with this I don't even know where to start. For one - there's the obvious problem that because something inherently is primed to hold a certain set of beliefs doesn't mean that they're correct; there are a number of traits of humanity that are essential to us that might lead us to undertake a number of actions that most we say we 'ought not' do; I'm not convinced that life is in fact that value that underlies the existence lifeforms (Nietzsche would argue that living things want to discharge their strength, and self-preservation is merely the most frequent indirect result); and finally, how do we determine 'what we are' as living entities and from this 'what we ought do'? What does that mean? How does that work? Sure, there's a few obvious things, like, we need food, water, shelter. But once we had an uncontrollable urge to reproduce and no way to fight this; now we have birth control, abortion, hormones, etc. If one can change what one essentially is with technology, do these cease to become ethical imperatives? On this very note, we fly in the face of our basic instincts and nature *all the time, every day*. How do we determine which ones to embrace and which to discard? Like most ethical philosophies, Rand had a number of logical arguments for arriving at a morality that looks more or less like our own - an individualistic version of our morality, but make no mistake, it is still *our* morality. What a coincidence! I've yet to see a philosopher say that they've cracked the hard nut of ethics and what they've realized is that it's okay to rape and murder people. Thus Rand's ethics are still just another way of trying to extrapolate from facts in order to defend our own cultural ideas and direct those ideas in a way that she'd agree with or value.\n\n&gt; There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence\u2014and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action.\n\nMaybe now is a great time to point out: does this apply to *all* living things? Do squirrels have 'values'? Surely they have instinct for certain things, but does this mean that they should be called 'values' in the same sense as our values? What about bacteria? They certainly have imperatives of their own existence. What about protozoa? What differentiates their 'values' from ours? And what makes it a 'value' and not just *merely* a simple fact of existence - that a protozoa simply acts a certain way and does not act in other ways, in the same sense of inanimate matter. I don't see the distinction - animate *and* inanimate matter have unconditional existences; the only difference is that the living matter will undergo a state change into non-living if certain conditions aren't met. So what? This is only significant if you *already value life*. Water will undergo a state change to gas is certain conditions are met. Does this make water's liquid existence 'conditional'? Should we argue that liquid water 'ought' remain liquid because 'the fact of what it is determines what it ought to be'? No. Water becoming gas is just something that happens, factually, upon certain conditions - a living thing becoming dead is also something that happens upon certain conditions. \n\n&gt; Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its life goes out of existence.\n\nA star has a process of self-sustaining and self-generating action. If it fails in that action, it burns out (or collapses or explodes or whatever depending on the circumstances). Why should a life being terminated bother us any more than a star burning out? It's just a change in matter - ohhh right, *because we're alive!* Again, this matters to us and obviously it would, but we shouldn't pretend as if things mattering to us make them 'matter' in and of themselves, or mean that they *should* matter to us; it's simply a fact that they do. And in all honesty - there are a great many people who share antithetical values, to Rand, to western society, to modern morality, to life itself even. Pointing to the fact that most humans 'do' value life will not explain to them why they 'should'. If morality isn't 'motivational', what good is it? If it can't convince me of why I should adhere to it, why should I?\n\n&gt; It is only the concept of \u201cLife\u201d that makes the concept of \u201cValue\u201d possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil.\n\nI'd argue that it's consciousness. And even so, even if life did create values that are anithetical to life... why should this be an argument against those values? Since there's no rational basis for preferring one set of values to another, merely the factual observation that we do have a certain set of values, or that values wouldn't be possible without life - why couldn't one hold whatever values they wanted? \n\nAnd finally, as for the argument that this will lead to a 'better' life - why should happiness, comfort, peace, rights, liberties, freedom, equality or any of these values be reasons for accepting those very values in the first place? It's circular. The only reason why one would think these things are 'better' is because, as Rand says, we value them already.

"}, {"id": "2mo4fl", "body": "I do not think there is an inherent purpose to life. I believe that life is, in fact, an accident, and that our existence is coincidental. Being so I also don't believe in eternal truths, mainly in the notion that there is an inherent good that people should be trying to attain.\n\n If any purpose exists it is constructed within the person, for otherwise, why would people exist? It is not to serve nature, surely, for humans ultimately oppose nature, especially in modern society. In the case that there was a God, I suppose one could argue that we exists for the God's sake, but why? For entertainment? I am really not clear how purpose can be inherent and not constructed. \n\nThe same goes for the greater good. There does not seem to be a good that exists from with out the person or societies. If there were a greater\u00a0 objective good, why then, with the exception of murder and incest, are very few things seen as universally bad among all society's? And why are few things seen as universally good? For example, in America it is seen as wrong to arrange a marriage, especially among children under 18. But in many countries that is the standard. If a universal good exists, how come there is so much variance as to what is right and wrong?\n\nHowever, I believe this to be a good thing. As opposed to more traditional nihilism which equates meaningless to life being futile, I believe that the lack of a notion of a greater good or purpose, is a freeing thing. With no greater purpose or greater good, one can construct it for oneself. The most important thing becomes one's personal experience in the world, and maximizing that to its full potential. There is no worry of not meeting a cosmic standard; the standards are within yourself. And so, a person does not have to be limited from (most) any experience unless they so desire it.\n\nAs such, I would categorize myself as an ethical hedonist: without any inherent purpose, experience is the most important thing, and pleasurable experience being the greatest kind of experience, one should strive for that for themselves. However, because all people are on this journey, one person's search for pleasure cannot infringe on another. I fully believe if everyone felt this way, society would be more functional, as everyone would be operating on the basis of mutual respect. \n\n\nSo Reddit, Change My View, about any and all of these things:\n1. Life having a purpose\n2. The existence of an inherent good\n3. The absence of these being freeing\n4.

Of course far-right conservatives don't care: they are critical of one half of the fabricated \"political spectrum\", but (at least explicitly) not the political process itself.\n\nDon't you think that people who, for instance, organized Occupy Wall Street movements might have thought to remove any phones and computers from the room in which they planned? They would have had good reason to do so: we have since learned that both your computer and your phone can be remotely rigged as snitches for the NSA. We also learned that the only thing they need to do so is a secret rubber stamp from a secret kangaroo court.\n\nIt is not just about whether or not it stops people from saying what they think, but how it influences how people say what they think. And I don't think you can excuse Snowden as you do, for I think he is actually central to this: you can't stop by noting that he is legally prohibited from releasing this, but you must ask *WHY* he is prohibited. It is because before people did something that they knew was legally questionable, they changed the law so that nobody could tell on them for doing it. Laws and government policies are not independent cogs in the system, but support and rely upon each other.\n\nThe issue is not that surveillance like this *stops* people from saying what they think, but that it *raises the cost* of people saying what they think (by, for instance, requiring OWS to remove all electronics from the room). As you raise the cost of such dissent, protest, and assembly, presumably fewer people would practice it. This is bad because a) democracy relies on the candid expression of public opinion, and b) the fewer people to watch, the more one can watch them, and hence the costs gets raised even higher and even fewer people dissent, and so on."}, {"id": "cm6hwpl", "body": "But I don't think people have any problem voicing anti-government sentiment.

I grew up thinking that nuclear war was a very imminent possibility.  Until I was in my late 20s there was every reason to believe that someone would set off 'the bomb', if not as a matter of national policy, then as an accident.  I went to sleep for a few decades not actually being sure that I'd wake up in the morning. \n\nAnd then the Soviet/American thing worked itself out, and everyone was paranoid about the Japanese for quite a while.  \n\nThe world has changed so much in my lifetime, and in the lifetimes of people that I've known.  My grandparents grew up thinking that the British Empire was the be all and end all (and it was, for a few centuries).  The United States isn't the \"America\" that I grew up with as a Canadian- while there were some quibbles about manifest destiny and the role that the U.S. participated in in the 20th century, it was still pretty much 'the land of the free' for a lot of my generation. Not so much any more. \n\nI don't know what China, or India, or Africa is going to do in the next century.  I do think that the \"West\" is going to need some time to sort itself out, and that we're not going to be the power brokers for very long.  If I had to place a guess on what's going to be interesting to world powers over the next few hundred years, I'd put natural resources at the top of the list. Politics, population, and political systems are likely to mean much 'less' than access to energy sources.  The U.S. (and the current Canadian government) seem to be very short-sighted at the moment- they're bickering about religion and abortion and gun control and taxes and immigrants when if they'd look 50 years down the road, those things are going to matter much less than who has water.  \n\nI don't think that the future is necessarily bleak.  It's probably very bleak for some Western governments, but science and innovation and a desire to have people survive is probably going to come to the forefront at some point.  \n\nI don't think that it's going to be an easy transition- I am sad that my kids' generation seem to be more focused on immediate gratification and political differences than they are on the future, and that they may (as a generation) not even have the knowledge or skills to make reasonable decisions.  Canadian primary and high school education sucks a bit now, but at least they're taught about the scientific method, and aren't indoctrinated into creation science/woo etc.  I think that our kids will get past that, but that's because I'm basically an optimist about human society.  \n\n"}, {"id": "cm5xikh", "body": "&gt;Europe's economy is slowly crumbling and with it many its advancements to society.\n\nEconomies rise and fall, I wouldn't say this is a big deal (For the future, obviously for the present it would be a big deal) unless it lasts for many many decades.\n\nThe thing is, the current trends are in no way set in stone nor are they unstoppable.

This means the climate related problems we are seeing now are caused by the emissions from the 70s. Problem is that [we have emitted more CO2 in the last 40 years than in the previous 150 years](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Carbon_Emission_by_Type.png). This means that climate change will get *much* worse in the following decades.\n\nThe big problem with climate are so called positive feedback systems. Those are non linear systems which once activated take a life of their own (so to speak) and simply can't be stopped. For example Arctic ice melting or methane release. There are *enormous* amounts of methane trapped in different layers of ice. When the ice melts methane is released. Methane is about 20 times more \"powerful\" than CO2, and it traps a lot more heat in the atmosphere. More methane, more temperature, more ice melting, more methane release, etc. Not only we don't know how much methane there is, but scientists studying it say a gigantic methane \"blurp\" can occur at any moment which could rise the temperature significantly in a mater of weeks (and release even more methane).\n\n[Here's a good introduction to methane and arctic ice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSsPHytEnJM) In that video you can see the world's leading experts on those subjects.\n\nThe IPCC, which is the UN organism that studies Climate Change is about to release their new report.

Everything has to be paid for by someone because in order to get a service, someone else must be paid to provide it. That's the economy.

The immediate problem is to free ourselves from the shackles imposed, very consciously [by people] who don't want the facts to be known. And for very good reasons. Because if people know the facts, they aren't going to tolerate it. Therefore you have to prevent them from knowing, you have to indoctrinate them. You have to tell them stories about how we're really good guys and if we use violence, it must be for the general good because we represent the course of history.

I think people's memory of the horrors of the 20th century will preclude the same fate. But I agree that's where governments are headed, judging by the number of laws. \n\n&gt;Europe's economy is slowly crumbling\n\nIt's been much worse before, but I agree that the general tendency of people in power is to become corrupt and try to gain more power, then centralization of the economy leads to collapse. \n\n&gt;Wealth distribution is at its worst since 1929 \n\nThat's not a great way to measure standard of living. Poor people today live better than poor people of 1929. \n\n&gt;Meanwhile china, a country which is known for oppression, censorship, lack of freedom, democracy, etc, is on the rise to become the next global superpower in terms of economics - and possibly influence.\n\nIt's rising because it's becoming less state communistic (less oppressive), which is a good thing. It's actually freer than the US in many ways. \n\n&gt;While I do realize this is a going to be a slow process that will take decades, it just seems inevitable that 200 years of social progress is slowly being erased.\n\nDon't think the future is so set in stone. Trends only tell us what will happen *if the trend continues*. To make this clearer, think about how the world looked before the industrial revolution. \n\nI have high hopes for the future because people's moral beliefs have improved over time: slavery is no longer accepted, many parts of the world reject sexism, racism, ageism, and so on; children are beaten less and less at home (and not at all at school); and the free exchange of ideas on the internet has brought us all together. Of course, governments could destroy all this progress, but if cultural evolution continues on the right path, people will reject the initiation of violence and governments will be eliminated.

Wealth distribution isn't that big of a problem. Let me explain:\n\n1: While yes, The rich are richer. The poor are also richer. It's simply the case that the rich gets richer faster that creates this apparant divide. [source](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/07/the_poor_are_getting_richer)\n\n2: The definition of poverty or poor and also luxery and rich gets upgraded all the time: Having enough food to not directly starve was seen as luxery during most of humanities history. In the 1920's not having to share a single room with other people was a luxery. Showering was a luxery. This can even be extended to the 90's. Having access to computers and cellphones was a luxery. And those things are all considered basic now. This opens up my third point.\n\n3: Technology keeps making peoples lives better independent of wealth.\nThink about the advancements of healthcare, transport, education in the last century. Doesn't matter how wealthy you are. You have access to antibiotics, can get almost everywhere for cheap. And you are more educated (and have access to more information) than most kings in history.\n\nSecond point. \"China\".\n\nDictatorships are the most efficient form of governance.\nThe problem with dictatorships aren't their lack of representation.\nThe problem lies with governments abusing their power.\n\nAlso china isn't a dictatorship in the strict sense of the word. This rquires an understanding of the governance of china to understand.\n\n1: While china has a single party state that governs the entirety of china. The municipalities of china usually have a great set of autonomy (which can indeed be overruled by the chinese government in extreme cases). Which in turn give their population voting booths to vote for the leader of said municipality. \n\n2: Everyone can become a member of the party provided you are qualified. (The qualifications include having a masters degree/PHD in engineering for example)\n\n3: Due to the requirements for party membership and large ruling memberships (close to 5000 people in the council that all have equal valued votes). The quality and expertise of the party is extremely high and probably the best in the world. The chinese government feels almost like a [technocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy)\n\n4: Most actions of the chinese government seems to be aimed at extremely long term progress for the chinese people. While, yes they have high polution rates right now. They also have the biggest green energy budget of the world [source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jackperkowski/2012/07/27/china-leads-the-world-in-renewable-energy-investment/) (and are the fastest growers in green energy). And also have one of the highest research budgets in the world (and they plan to upgrade the budget to be the highest in the world in the future). \n\nYou also seem to ignore most of the positive developments of the world and focus on the (in your eyes) bad qualities.\n\nList of some good progress:\n\n1: Gay rights are improving globally.\n2: War on drugs is slowly coming to an end and drug policies worldwide are more free and on an improving trend.\n3: All those developmental work in the third world is finally really helping and the third world is really booming and might be catch up to first world countries in matter of decades [source](http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/)\n4: Artificial intelligence is making a great comeback and automation is booming as a result of this (This is a good thing in my eyes but subjective).\n5: Big institutions (like google) are investing billions in technology and research for extreme longevity within humans. And we might be the first generation of humans to stop and reverse our aging process.\n\nTL;DR: We are actually experiencing the golden age transcending towards the platinum age of humanity. Yes we see some hickups here and there mostly due to this temporary economic crisis. But most trends and statistics point out the great era that lies (not even that far) ahead. I am absolutely glad to live in this time and embrace the future with open arms."}, {"id": "2mnthx", "body": "I just feel like the future looks very sinister for the global society.

In fact, China is both liberalizing, and advancing. Don't get me wrong, they still have a long way to go, but for a one party state, they have been on a steady (assuming economic actions), since the Sino-Soviet split which happened in 1960.\n\n&gt; Europe's economy is slowly crumbling and with it many its advancements to society (such as its highly developed social security ).\n\nEurope's problems stem from political, economic, geographic, and cultural divisions within the continent. To be completely honest, it really isn't its own separate continent, as its geographic nomenclature is an artifact of classical antiquity. It is considered one politically, but acceptance of the demarcation makes less sense.\n\n The problem with Europe may stem from it being is so vast (not by today's standards), that political, cultural, and economic identities for the various regions developed beyond strict adherence to the present-day integration. Take the United States for example, and its counterpart, the pre-Constitution Articles of Confederation (which faced a different colonial problem: that it was too weak for warfare). \n\n European fragmentation, whether wary nationalists in Germany and Greece, or the strong Anti-Euro block in the U.K., have their own justifications for returning to self-rule. The U.S. economy, (and China's) for example, are just as dependent on weak states as they are on the strong ones. So I can see how the responsibility-for-the-other thing doesn't sit well with some in Europe.\n\n&gt; Governments are spying on us more than ever.\n\nIf you are from a first world country, the powers the government has against you have been steadily curtailed. Over the long trajectory time scale, surveillance may have certainly increased, but the ability for your government to kill you (without questions), while the international community sits by and respects sovereignty has certainly reduced considerably.\n\n&gt; they have the ability to manipulate and oppress us on a scale never seen before\n\nIf you are from a representative democracy, become informed (at the level of policy and its effect on you), and then vote accordingly. The humans shouldn't even matter in the calculus of politics. This does not mean they should be replaced by machines, but voting on the feel-good visage someone you are inclined to ideologically support is not the same as endorsing the instrumentality that a specific set of policies or ideals can provide.\n\n&gt; While I do realize this is a going to be a slow process that will take decades, it just seems inevitable that 200 years of social progress is slowly being erased.\n\nThe only global development you cited was social security, which is something that can be easily resolved politically (as opposed to say, advancements in heavy manufacturing or metallurgy which cannot simply be resolved through legislation, and has to be innovated). Meanwhile, a country like China (with its advantages AND setbacks), has a country-wide high speed rail network and is one of the biggest investors in renewable energy.\n\nTechnological and material advancements work lock step with social ones, so even though:\n \n&gt; Wealth distribution is at its worst since 1929 (source[1] ) .\n\n-which I won't challenge, that-\n\n&gt;it just seems inevitable that 200 years of social progress is slowly being erased.\n\n-is somewhat hard for me to perceive.

That was very traumatic for you, therefore it's natural that you don't want to engage in a romantic relationship now - or maybe even a while into the future. Rationalizing that relationships are bad is a very natural thing for you to do when you're trying to cope with your past. But there is a difference between believing that you don't want to be in a relationship *right now*, and that relationships are bad *for you*, and rationalizing that you *never* want to be in a relationship, and relationships are bad for *everyone*. If you make the mistake of being so categorical, you risk closing yourself off to a personally and socially significant and rewarding part of life, which will hurt you more than your ex ever could. The suffering that others cause us is bad enough, but nowhere near as bad as the suffering we are capable of inflicting on ourselves.\n\nThis isn't about relationships and whether they're good or bad or useless. This is about you recovering from a trauma. You are free to take as much time to recover from your trauma as you need, but consider getting a therapist, who is a person paid to help you think through and come to terms with yourself faster than you can on your own (a therapist is somebody who teaches calculus to the soul, basically). But once we're past that, consider that there are two types of people in the world: risk-takers and risk-avoiders. They should be called pleasure-seekers and pain-avoiders. It makes sense for some people to be one and not the other, and for a person to switch according to the situation they're in, but generally speaking: risk-seekers sometimes lose, but risk-avoiders never win. When you don't do something because the risk is too great, you're a risk-avoider. When you're a risk-avoider in situations where the pain is non-fatal and you've had experience dealing with it before and the potential payoff is greater than the potential risk, you're a loser. Unless, of course, you've never dealt with the pain from your last attempt, and it just keeps following you around like a sad ghost, preventing you from things, then the calculation is biased - but that's not a flaw of the experience itself.\n\nFinally, the only thing you need to sustain life is water and a gaseous atmosphere. What *you* need to sustain *your* life is enough food to collect nutrients from before it goes out your pooper, water, sleep, and some manner of keeping your body temperature stable in extreme weather conditions. Your friends, sex friends, family, companionship, or a CS degree are not strictly necessary to the functioning of your organism. You *choose* to have them in your life. Everything you engage in superfluous to basic life support is just that - voluntary. It's your choice whether to have romantic relationships, and if you choose not to, for whatever reason, then what you say goes. But - and you can take it or leave it - it's better to make your choices out of love, not out of fear."}, {"id": "2mn8kx", "body": "To give a little bit of background of myself, I'm currently a 21 year old male and a senior in college, looking to get my degree in Computer Science next year.

I did not ever hit her, but there were a few times where I would have to physically restrain her as she would try to do something crazy like jump out of the car while we were driving on the freeway at 65 mph+.\n\nNow, after this relationship, I believe it's safe to say that I was scarred. People say that I've just let this one girl ruin my view but I feel like it's completely normal, from an evolutionary standpoint, to avoid things that have caused you pain in the past.

The only difference between a close friend and a significant other, in my opinion, is sexual intercourse, which I already talked about before.  \n\nI know for a fact that marriage has financial benefits on top of the benefits I listed above, but is a legal contract with someone for financial benefits really worth all of the trouble that goes along with it? All of the fighting, potential emotional/physical abuse, hard work to maintain the relationship? It doesn't seem worth it to me.\n\nChange my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Please note that I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about these events (we should) or that I think they weren't horrible or wrong, simply that people who are alive today had no control over them and therefore should not be getting blamed and shamed for them.\n\n* White Americans should not be shamed or have to apologize for slavery. \n* Germans should not have to apologize for WWII or the Holocaust.\n* Americans should not be getting shamed for treatment of Japanese during WWII.\n* Belgium should not have to apologize for their treatment of the Congo\n* Christians should not be shamed for the Crusades or the Inquisition or any other event that occurred 100s of years ago in a church very dissimilar to that of today.\n* Americans should not have to apologize for dropping atomic bombs on Japan.\n* Men should not be shamed for the oppression of women by past generations\n\nThis view is relatively simple. Because people today had no influence or control over their ancestors actions, they should not be shamed or have to apologize for them. If you are a American, or German, or whoever, you should be able to be proud of that without being accused of being racist, or a Nazi, or violent, or &lt;insert negative characteristic here&gt;.\n\nGroundlessly accusing someone of contributing towards oppression that happened generations ago is not right. No white American living today has anything to do with slavery. Does that change the fact that it happened? No. Does it change the fact that it continues to affect millions of people today? No. But living white Americans didn't commit the act, so why blame or punish them for it.\n\nSimilarly, if your great-grandfather was a serial killer, you are not necessarily a serial killer. If your great-great-great-great-grandmother kept slaves, that implies nothing about your view towards African Americans. I do not understand how people can keep the view that people are implicated by the crimes of past generations.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The point of many official apologies is to respond to ignorance or misplaced historical pride. Sometimes a dramatic, symbolic gesture is necessary to bring these issues into the open, and sometimes shame is the only corrective to pride.\n\nFurthermore, central to the modern state is the idea that successive governments are continuous. This implies that obligations incurred and promises made by previous governments will be upheld by future ones (even if a new party constitutes the new government). This also implies that there is some timeless state entity that is responsible for past acts and on whose behalf apologies can be made (this does not necessarily apply where there have been fundamental changes in the nature of the state as in Germany and Japan, but it ought to apply to the US).\n\nSometimes people still feel like the past injury is relevant. Armenians whose great-grandparents were deported from Turkey continue to suffer the consequences of that decision (and land-deeds from that era are past down to preserve the memory; indeed these deeds *may* be recognised in the near future). Sometimes these feelings of injury are so great they disrupt contemporary relations (as with Japan and South Korea/China). An expression of shame and remorse can help mend this. Sometimes an apology is just necessary but is never received. The current state may not be the best party to offer it, but they can be better than nothing.\n\nLastly, not only do people continue to suffer from past actions, but other people continue to benefit. The vast majority of white people in America have benefited (relatively) from America's treatment of blacks in a variety of ways (anything from capital accumulation during slavery on both a national and personal level to preferential treatment in housing). Where some people continue to suffer and some continue to benefit from past atrocities then perhaps some remorse, shame or apology is in fact due."}, {"id": "cm5q1q0", "body": "I believe that people should be able to claim pride in their heritage or nationality.

Please note that I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about these events (we should) or that I think they weren't horrible or wrong, simply that people who are alive today had no control over them and therefore should not be getting blamed and shamed for them.\n\n* White Americans should not be shamed or have to apologize for slavery. \n* Germans should not have to apologize for WWII or the Holocaust.\n* Americans should not be getting shamed for treatment of Japanese during WWII.\n* Belgium should not have to apologize for their treatment of the Congo\n* Christians should not be shamed for the Crusades or the Inquisition or any other event that occurred 100s of years ago in a church very dissimilar to that of today.\n* Americans should not have to apologize for dropping atomic bombs on Japan.\n* Men should not be shamed for the oppression of women by past generations\n\nThis view is relatively simple. Because people today had no influence or control over their ancestors actions, they should not be shamed or have to apologize for them. If you are a American, or German, or whoever, you should be able to be proud of that without being accused of being racist, or a Nazi, or violent, or &lt;insert negative characteristic here&gt;.\n\nGroundlessly accusing someone of contributing towards oppression that happened generations ago is not right. No white American living today has anything to do with slavery. Does that change the fact that it happened? No. Does it change the fact that it continues to affect millions of people today? No. But living white Americans didn't commit the act, so why blame or punish them for it.\n\nSimilarly, if your great-grandfather was a serial killer, you are not necessarily a serial killer. If your great-great-great-great-grandmother kept slaves, that implies nothing about your view towards African Americans.

Furthermore, by visiting shrines where, from the perspective of those victimized in the war, war criminals are entombed, these politicians are sending a message to each group involved in the conflict; to the Japanese public, \"Our national pride is one of the most valuable treasures we have\", to the right-wing, \"Don't worry, even though we may say one thing, we actually agree with you\", and to the rest of the world, \"Go fuck yourself\".\n\nThe erasure of the darker sides of Japanese history are also part of an attempt to garner support for revising the Japanese constitution to once again allow it strengthen it's military and undergo its own military operations. So, in this case, how are China and Korea supposed to react? \"Oh sure, do whatever you want. I mean, you never really apologized for (and in some cases never acknowledged) what you did, but I see no problems with you trying to rearm and re-position yourself as military power in the region. Go ahead, it's fine!\"\n\nIt isn't about \"Groundlessly accusing someone of contributing towards oppression that happened generations ago\"; It's making sure that those parties learned from their past mistakes are unlikely to commit them again. In the case of Germany, I'm pretty sure no one thinks they are still plotting to kill all the Jews and take over Europe, so, if you notice, people don't really get that angry at them about that anymore.

I'm not saying it wasn't a horrible tragedy, but when you're arguing with someone, it helps to have your facts straight and not rely on hyperbole to get your point across.\n\nIf we are comparing numbers, 40,000 to 300,000 civilians are estimated to have been tortured and murdered by the Japanese army during the Rape of Nanjing. Can you justify the killing of children who simply were born in China and did nothing wrong? \n\nMy point is, frankly, that what a country does after it commits atrocities is the important factor. While Japan left China in ruins and even now refuses to accept its roll in the war, America laid down the infrastructure for Japan's post-war recovery and made Japan one of its closest Allies.

WMDs doesn't only refer to nuclear weapons, it also include chemical and biological weapons. As I recall, the British were guilty of using bio weapons against the Native Americans during the siege of Fort Pitt when they infected the Native Americans in hope that the poison would easily spread and destroy them and well as their fellow people living in faraway tuts. As a result, 400,000-500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans died from mainly from smallpox than combat. \n\nLet's not forget the widespread use of chemical weapons during World War I by Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Russia and other participants of the war (as far as I know, the U.S. didn't get a chance to employ them in the battlefield so we were excluded) despite being against international law (1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare). They knew chemical weapon was wrong and it was against international law, yet they still used them in spite of the odds. Following the war, chemical weapons had inflicted 1.5 million casualties, including 100,000-260,000 civilians. What's sick is that both sides knew such weapons would cause civilian casualties yet most of them don't care, and hell, it wasn't done by planes either!\n\n[The distribution of gas cloud casualties was not only limited to the front. Nearby towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through. Civilians rarely had a warning system put into place to alert their neighbors of the danger. In addition to poor warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands of more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew that such weapon would cause major harm to civilians as wind would blow poison gases into nearby civilian towns but nonetheless continued to use them throughout the war. British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote in his diary: \"My officers and I were aware that such weapon would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common on the battlefront. However, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I#Civilian_casualties)\n\nSo if you think about it, the U.S. use of WMDs in general was small potatoes compared to other nations including those from the West."}, {"id": "2mmw1o", "body": "I'll start by giving a few examples of what I mean.

After all, they *did not do it*, and to blame them would be blaming an innocent party. Besides, how would a person know who to blame? Would they base it on nationality? Skin Tone? Gender? All of those things are just unfair generalizations.\n\nOrganizations such as countries have to be treated differently. Organizations like countries or the Catholic Church like to claim authority and also uniformity through the time they have existed. While some organizations admit to more change of themselves than others, they desire the ability to claim that they are the SAME organization. For example, the United States of America was the same country before and after the Civil War, even if things were far from ideal before the freeing of the slaves.\n\nSo let us take a look at your examples...\n\n&gt;White Americans should not be shamed or have to apologize for slavery.\n\nI agree. Again, individuals are not responsible for the actions of their ancestors. If anything, it is a shame that a label (\"White\") is even being used to judge everyone in that group, because all that is affected by is your level of certain proteins in your skin.\n\nStill, I think that the United States of America itself should feel remorseful for allowing Slavery to become so popular in this country. Yes, for many people during that era, slavery was not a moral issue. But America is still a country that was founded on the idea that all people were created equally, yet for almost it's first 100 years, it allowed slavery. It took even longer for women (over half the population) to gain the right to vote. Although America didn't know any better, it had an obligation to **be** better. A child may call a man a Nigger because he doesn't understand what's wrong, but that child should be remorseful when they grow up, after understanding the error of their ways. One could brush that aside due to the youth of the child, but the *child himself* should be remorseful, as learning from our mistakes is truly the only way we grow.\n\n&gt;Germans should not have to apologize for WWII or the Holocaust.\n\nAgain, I don't have any ill will toward the German people themselves (except for the ones who advocated or willingly fought for those terrible policies). I **do** believe that the Government which likes to claim that it has existed and had power since before WWII, did in fact let people down and not protect the individuals of the nation like it was supposed to do. I completely understand that the Government and the people of the time were warped due to several factors, but the German Government is still the same organization as in year's past, even if it has changed. The German Government failed to protect it's people, which is it's duty, and therefore it *should* apologize.\n\n&gt;Americans should not be getting shamed for treatment of Japanese during WWII.\n\nSimilar to above, I certainly believe that anyone who advocated or enacted those polices should certainly be ashamed of themselves, but the other Americans shoulder no blame. As I mentioned in a previous section, the Government *IS* to blame for it's colossal failure of protecting individual's freedoms. Not only did they take away people's rights for no founded reason, but they also let fear allow them to judge people for inappropriate reasons. The Internment Camps of Japanese Americans in WWII was completely unfounded and you can be sure that a similar situation won't happen again (some people compare it to things like Guantanimo but there are significant differences). The Government of the United States *has* apologized, because they acknowledged failure to uphold the law and the standards that the people have set for it. With that, we have learned and grown.\n\n&gt;Belgium should not have to apologize for their treatment of the Congo\n\nI honestly don't know much about the policies of colonial Belgium, but I *do* know that they are considered to be very brutal. Again, the Belgian Government is ultimately responsible for these things. Even if it was relatively acceptable practice then (it wasn't by the way, other countries felt as though Belgium was terrible for doing what it was doing), we should all hold Belgium to a higher standard now.\n\n&gt;Christians should not be shamed for the Crusades or the Inquisition or any other event that occurred 100s of years ago in a church very dissimilar to that of today.\n\nThe Catholic Church which is responsible for such atrocities as the Crusades, Inquisition and Massive Child Molestation Cover-Ups is an organization that *proudly* believes in a unified church since it's very founding, when Jesus chose Peter to be the leader of the world's Church. This church claims moral authority over humanity and a connection with their god, to which we all (according to them) are subject to. While I do not blame the lay Christian, I think it is reasonable to CERTAINLY lay blame on the people involved in these scandals/policies. As it is, the Church has often avoided apologizing for these things and probably won't for quite a while. In 2000, Pope John Paul II asked for forgiveness \"for the divisions which have occurred among Christians, for the violence some have used in the service of the truth and for the distrustful and hostile attitudes sometimes taken toward the followers of other religions.\" In 2004, they finally asked for forgiveness for the Inquisition. In 1962-65, the Church finally said that Jewish people *were not responsible for deicide, the killing of a god*, 20 years **after** the Holocaust. For these things and more, the Church (which believes itself to be the moral authority over all Humanity) should apologize. They wouldn't know any better at the time, but they want to claim that they are the same since the founding, so we should hold them to that.\n\n&gt;Americans should not have to apologize for dropping atomic bombs on Japan.\n\nAgain, Americans themselves are not to blame and I think that a large portion of people don't believe that the country did anything wrong either.\n\n&gt;Men should not be shamed for the oppression of women by past generations\n\nI agree. It was a different world. It is more important now to recognize that there *was* and *still is* inequality and work toward correcting that. Most women feel similar and have no grudges toward men."}, {"id": "2mmw1o", "body": "I'll start by giving a few examples of what I mean. Please note that I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about these events (we should) or that I think they weren't horrible or wrong, simply that people who are alive today had no control over them and therefore should not be getting blamed and shamed for them.\n\n* White Americans should not be shamed or have to apologize for slavery. \n* Germans should not have to apologize for WWII or the Holocaust.\n* Americans should not be getting shamed for treatment of Japanese during WWII.\n* Belgium should not have to apologize for their treatment of the Congo\n* Christians should not be shamed for the Crusades or the Inquisition or any other event that occurred 100s of years ago in a church very dissimilar to that of today.\n* Americans should not have to apologize for dropping atomic bombs on Japan.\n* Men should not be shamed for the oppression of women by past generations\n\nThis view is relatively simple. Because people today had no influence or control over their ancestors actions, they should not be shamed or have to apologize for them. If you are a American, or German, or whoever, you should be able to be proud of that without being accused of being racist, or a Nazi, or violent, or &lt;insert negative characteristic here&gt;.\n\nGroundlessly accusing someone of contributing towards oppression that happened generations ago is not right. No white American living today has anything to do with slavery. Does that change the fact that it happened? No. Does it change the fact that it continues to affect millions of people today? No. But living white Americans didn't commit the act, so why blame or punish them for it.\n\nSimilarly, if your great-grandfather was a serial killer, you are not necessarily a serial killer. If your great-great-great-great-grandmother kept slaves, that implies nothing about your view towards African Americans. I do not understand how people can keep the view that people are implicated by the crimes of past generations.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I am learning computer programming on my own to try to create a better future for myself, but I have a lot of people telling me it won't work/is pointless unless I go back to school, which I can't do without taking on a lot of debt (like a lot of people). \n\nI'll define \"success\" for the purposes of my statement. I believe success is making enough money to solve most of life's common/uncommon issues. For example, if my dog requires an operation of around $3,000.00, I can't afford that, but a person who can, I would deem them successful. If my car breaks down tomorrow, I'll be taking the bus, whereas a successful person will pay to have their car fixed, or have purchased a new car before the old one dies. If I need to replace my roof after this winter, I won't be able to without taking on debt. And, like most Americans, I am one major health issue away from crippling medical debt. I maintain successful people have many problems, and that the ones I have listed are not on their radar. (i.e. I am worried my dog may need surgery one day, but not worried about how I will pay for it.)\n\nAn obvious counter argument to this is that if I had less stuff, I would be able to pay for these things, or not need things at all. Becoming a monk in a cave might be an extreme example. I would maintain that the monk, people in large amounts of debt, or people with fewer possessions in general (even in poverty) certainly can be very HAPPY. But I would not consider them SUCCESSFUL. If my car dies and I convince myself I am perfectly happy taking the bus everywhere, I could consider myself happy, just not successful. \n\nSo, without student loans, or other large forms of debt, I believe I will not become successful in my lifetime. \n\nI'm looking forward to someone changing my view! \n"}, {"id": "cm5ovaz", "body": "Computer programming is one thing you can learn on your own for very little cost.

Then jumping. It's that feeling of learning new things and being able to apply them immediately to do cool stuff.\n\nI don't know how smart you are, or what motivates you. If learning cool shit interests you and you get excited by the idea of applying that stuff to make neat projects then you'll be fine for sure. If you're *only* in it for the money and actually hate CS, you'll probably not do as well. If you think CS is pretty cool, don't hate it, and are happy with the money it makes, that can be good enough. Some people make programming their whole life but that doesn't mean you need to. If you can keep up your studies you should do fine. It's really up to you, and I don't know you, so I can't tell you if you'll succeed or not. The main factor to consider here is how strong you think your resolve is. If you're determined and you can follow through, then I would say this is not much of a long shot. If you practice and learn for the next few years and hone your skills, you will have the skill to get an entry level position. \n\nEven if you find you lack the internal motivation to do it on your own and you need to rely on some form of external motivation and structure, maybe school is what you need, but even that doesn't mean you'll fall into huge debt. Depending on where you are there may be community college courses which are more affordable, and there's online courses that provide at least some amount of structure.

I'm a lot like anyone else where I am lazy about certain things and not about others.

How many of them are on hiring committees for software companies. (For the record, I am an interviewer at a software company)\n\nMaybe they know you better than I do. Like I said, this will take discipline to accomplish. Do you have a history of being lazy and not following through? If you feel you have the drive, then maybe they're wrong. \n\nI personally know programmers who didn't go to school. Their skill vary, some were better than others. Some were really smart and just hate college. Some didn't have the money for college and just tried learning on their own. \n\nEven if you don't know what field you want to learn, you could always pick a reasonable looking school with a CS program, see what courses they have in CS, and then just start 'taking' the classes online. Most CS teachers will have at least half decent websites with their course listings and topics, and you can just start studying those topics. There's plenty of resources for programmers. Here on reddit there's /r/learnprogramming. There's StackOverflow.com. There's codecademy. There's all kinds of resources for those who want to learn.
