Sex *only* leads to pregnancy if the woman is ovulating.  Sex very infrequently leads to pregnancy when contraception is used even *if* the woman is ovulating.

Your argument seems to be that when someone consents to sex they consent to pregnancy, and the way you know they consented to pregnancy is because they consented to sex, which means they consented to pregnancy... and so on.\n\nAs others have said, consenting to the *small chance of pregnancy* does not mean someone has consented to pregnancy; they may have acknowledged there is a small chance, but that does not mean they decided they were okay with bringing a life into the world. Pregnancy is a reversible condition (via abortion).  One CAN [consent](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/consent) to having sex (with the small chance of pregnancy) and not expect to have to *remain* pregnant (unless by choice).  And you know that many women do not, in fact, consent to pregnancy every time they have sex, because so many people have abortions each year.  If people actually *consented to pregnancy* every time they had sex, they wouldn't want abortions. \n\n[Autonomy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/) is the ability to govern oneself.  Bodily autonomy is, fundamentally, the ability to make an [\"informed, un-coerced decision\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy) about your body.  Therefore, it interferes with a woman's ability to make an *informed, un-coerced decision* about her body if you *coerce* her into continuing a pregnancy that she does not want (by removing her ability to choose).\n\nLet's leave the idea of whether \"a fetus has the right to life\" out of the equation, for a moment. What if we replace the fetus with something that doesn't have a right to life.  Like a watermelon.  What if every time a woman had sex, there was a small chance a watermelon would be planted inside of her, that would take a few months to grow to its full size?  In this day and age, she has the legal ability to go ask for the watermelon to be removed.  It is her choice.  Just because she had sex doesn't mean she needs to live with a watermelon in her for nine months.  Maybe later, she'll want a watermelon, but definitely not right now...  It's obvious that would infringe upon a woman's bodily autonomy to force her to carry it to term, when there's a feasible option to remove it readily available.\n\nThis is why there's so much debate over the personhood of a fetus.  It all hinges on that.  You are asserting that a woman should have to carry a pregnancy to term, because she should have accepted the risks of engaging in sex.  The main argument to support your position is that a fetus' right to life outweighs a woman's bodily autonomy, which is why everyone thinks you are arguing from a very pro-life point of view.  Everyone knows that restricting abortion limits a woman's bodily autonomy--the anti-abortion and pro-choice sides both know that.  The question is: does a fetus' right to life outweigh a woman's rights to her own body?

Just like people use condoms. Or birth control. \n\nAnd as for your example, sex isn't just about \"having fun\". It's not a form of entertainment. It's a very real, physical urge. Consider poor teenage boys who get involuntary erections in adolescence. They didn't \"choose\" that, but their body reacts. Same way for pre-mature ejaculation. They didn't choose that. \n\nTL;DR : You need to consider the biological aspects of the argument before you judge. If it's consensual attraction and mutual willingness to have sex, people don't necessarily have the physical capacity to be rational in that hormonally charged moment. And asking people to abstain from that side of humanity, an intimate connection with another soul, is too much to ask of anyone.\n\nEdit:Grammar and Organization"}, {"id": "2m5bpx", "body": "I see the argument that consent to sex isn't consent to pregnancy thrown around a lot, mainly when people say that 'outlawing abortion is restricting bodily autonomy'.

We did not agree to getting our limbs broken but we did acknowledge that by playing this game, it is a real possibility. I have no right to sue this person. I have no right to be mad at this person.

Aside from getting your tubes tied or getting a vasectomy: I have not heard of any type of birth control that is 100% effective. It does not matter the precautions you take. You knew there was a possibility when engaging in sexual intercourse that pregnancy can occur. You chose to engage. \n\nAlso: the same applies for all other aspects of sex. If you are using sex for orgasms but you become deeply connected to another person, you can't get mad and say i did not agree to this. The argument that sex can be what you want it to be and nothing of any other aspect is foolish. When we eat food: we know we intake calories, our body responds to the food and we get flavors (if you are capable of that) from the food.

If this is irrelevant, I can't see what you are arguing against at all.\n\nHave a look at this scenario: I had (consensual) sex with my wife; she got pregnant. She knew she could get pregnant, and she knew she could get an abortion if she got pregnant. Then she got an abortion.\n\nOr she decided to carry the pregnancy to term and raise the child. Or put them up for adoption.\n\nIn essence, she has bodily autonomy; she can do whatever she wants! That's the point. If you restrict any one of her options, you are restricting her autonomy. Maybe there are population control laws going on, and the government is forcing her to have an abortion (since we have a child already). Or the government forces her to carry the pregnancy to term and deny her the right to have the medical operation that would end her pregnancy. Both are possible, and both are ways of government to invade her bodily autonomy, wouldn't you agree? If she had autonomy, she could choose to do whatever she wants **anytime** she wants.\n\nMaybe she consented **both** to sex **and** pregnancy when she had sex (so it wasn't an accident), but she caught me cheating, or just changed her mind and decided to end her pregnancy. It can happen. It doesn't have to be an accident and reversal.\n\nShe can consent to being impregnated, **and** she can consent to end her pregnancy. That's the point of her autonomy. When you say \"she can only consent to pregnancy, but she can't end her pregnancy\", you are limiting her freedom of choice for arbitrary reasons (or because you are anti-abortion, see the thing you are avoiding is very relevant).\n\nAnyways.\n\nThe point is, people can change their minds. A woman can consent to sex, and start having sex, and has the ability to say \"stop\" during sex. If her partner doesn't stop, it is rape. You can't go ahead and say \"well yeah she consented to sex, no backsies\" can you? Similarly, a woman can consent to pregnancy (can get pregnant because she wants to, or it can be an accident both are possible), then change her mind and decide she doesn't want to be pregnant after all.\n\nThis is the point of autonomy."}, {"id": "2m5bpx", "body": "I see the argument that consent to sex isn't consent to pregnancy thrown around a lot, mainly when people say that 'outlawing abortion is restricting bodily autonomy'.

Is there any reason for it to exist? \n\nIt seems like it would be simpler to have something like \"Day 48\" instead of \"February 17\". At the moment, the year is split up into twelve chunks, but they're not quite equal, their lengths appear to have no logical order aside from summing to 365 or 366, and one of them has a different length every 4 years. Whenever we refer to the frequency of an event as, say, \"once a month\", we could just as easily say that it's \"once every 30 days\".\n\n*Clarification: I'm saying that as it is, \"once a month\" is very imprecise anyway since months have varying lengths. For anything that can be this arbitrary, \"once every 30 days\" works just as well.*\n\nLeap years would also be extremely simple; instead of adding a day to a particular month, a day could just be added to a year. The year would then go up to Day 366 instead of Day 365.\n\n**Here's an example of why I think a calendar without months would be easier.**\n\nSuppose it's Saturday, September 20th, or Day 263. Let's suppose I wanted to figure out what day of the week December 5th (Day 339) would be.\n\nTo figure it out in my head using the current months system, I would have to go through the following procedure (which could probably be reduced a bit, but not greatly):\n\n9/20 is a Saturday\n\n9/27 is a Saturday\n\n9/30 is a Tuesday\n\n10/7 is a Tuesday\n\n10/28 is a Tuesday\n\n10/31 is a Friday\n\n11/7 is a Friday\n\n11/28 is a Friday\n\n11/30 is a Saturday\n\n12/7 is a Saturday\n\n12/5 is a Friday\n\nOn the other hand, if I wanted to figure out the same thing using a \"numbered-day system\", it would be simple:\n\n(Day 339)-(Day 263)=(76 days)=6 days (mod 7).\n\nTherefore, Day 339 is 6 days later than a Saturday, so it's a Friday.\n\n**EDIT: /u/chewy628 sort of changed my view by referencing the [International Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar), which uses many of the same ideas I expressed here while making it less math-intensive.

At a time when information theory was beginning to be applied in psychology, Miller observed that some human cognitive tasks fit the model of a \"channel capacity\" characterized by a roughly constant capacity in bits, but short-term memory did not. A variety of studies could be summarized by saying that short-term memory had a capacity of about \"seven plus-or-minus two\" chunks. Miller wrote, \"With binary items the span is about nine and, although it drops to about five with monosyllabic English words, the difference is far less than the hypothesis of constant information would require (see also, memory span). The span of immediate memory seems to be almost independent of the number of bits per chunk, at least over the range that has been examined to date.\" Miller acknowledged that \"we are not very definite about what constitutes a chunk of information.\"\n\n&gt;Miller noted that according to this theory, it should be possible to increase short-term memory for low-information-content items effectively by mentally recoding them into a smaller number of high-information-content items. \"A man just beginning to learn radio-telegraphic code hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. Soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks. Then the letters organize themselves as words, which are still larger chunks, and he begins to hear whole phrases.\" Thus, a telegrapher can effectively \"remember\" several dozen dits and dahs as a single phrase. Naive subjects can remember about only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, \"twenty-one\" for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient drill, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:\n\n &gt;\"It is a little dramatic to watch a person get 40 binary digits in a row and then repeat them back without error. However, if you think of this merely as a mnemonic trick for extending the memory span, you will miss the more important point that is implicit in nearly all such mnemonic devices. The point is that recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.\"\n\nThe main takeaway from Wikipedia should be this:  *All* humans have a very difficult time remembering long strings of things without chunking them up into groups to allow easier memory access.

Naive subjects can remember about only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, \"twenty-one\" for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient drill, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:\n\n &gt;\"It is a little dramatic to watch a person get 40 binary digits in a row and then repeat them back without error. However, if you think of this merely as a mnemonic trick for extending the memory span, you will miss the more important point that is implicit in nearly all such mnemonic devices. The point is that recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.\"\n\nThe main takeaway from Wikipedia should be this:  *All* humans have a very difficult time remembering long strings of things without chunking them up into groups to allow easier memory access.  I know you've also tried to chunk them into groups, but considering the \"magic number\" is 7 plus or minus 2, 30-31 is already pushing it (which is why we have *weeks*), let alone 90."}, {"id": "cm1bd26", "body": "So while this is sort of true, it's also something your brain can deal with no help.\n\nFor example with phone numbers, in the UK we write out entire number in either a single or two blocks. \n\nThat's xxxxx-xxxxxx or xxxxxxxxxxx. \n\nYet when we say numbers aloud we do it in 3 blocks and when people don't it sounds really strange. \n\nSimilarly, the French read out numbers in pairs. \n\nGiven that I can deal with 11 digit long numbers I feel people would be fine with 3 digits. \n\nThe biggest problem I see is the lack of easily referring to time scales. \n\nTwo weeks is much better than people saying an arbitrary number of days. \n\nPersonally I think it'd be best to work in 52 numbered weeks each with 7 sub days.

We have two calendars going on simultaneously here; we have the yearly cycle, which has these 12 uneven months, and we have the weekly cycle, which is completely unrelated and is a regular 7 days.  Why?  It comes down to two things: coordinating activity and marking time.  When you break up time into this 7-day cycle, you can pick a particular day to be the market day, for example, when everyone brings their products to the town center to buy and sell.  Or you can pick a day to be a rest day.  That kind of thing.  Why 7 days?  Because that's how it's always been done, and in an Abrahamic-religion-dominated world, there's religious significance to it as well.  The Maya had a completely different calendar that was actually a Cartesian product of *two* cycles, a 13-day cycle and a 20-day cycle.  So there was a 13-day week and a 20-day week, and they both ran at the same time; the whole thing obviously repeated every lcm(13, 20) = 260 days.  We have our 7-day cycle for historical reasons; it's just as arbitrary as the months.\n\nThis brings us to the other point: marking time.  You know how Garfield hates Mondays?  That's because each day has its own character.  There's something different about Monday that inspires particular feelings, and other days have their own feelings as well.  Well, the same is true for months.  We think of months as logical units -- arbitrarily, of course -- and we build these months and what they represent into our lives.  For example, I had my wedding in the middle of September.  Why?  Because September is a mild month, and we stood the best chance of a wedding day that was neither too hot nor too cold by picking September as opposed to, say, August or October, since the venue had no AC.  (It worked -- we had *beautiful* weather on our wedding day.)  There's no way I would have marked this difference if I had to think of days as one long set of 365.  There's no individual character to the time around day 143 versus around day 219.  I know approximately where they are in the year, but nothing outside of that.\n\nWe are, for better or for worse, humans, and we have human minds that think human thoughts with human symbols.

For example. Do most of us tend to assume that human life is valuable? Yes. Is that justified under a purely scientific, rational worldview? Not really, no. It's just a preference, albeit one that most hold dear.\n\nTry to convince a humanist that there's no basis for believing in the value of human life, and they're likely to react the same way as a religious zealot would to the suggestion that their religion is not true. The only alternative to having a \"restrictive belief\" is to not really believe in anything non-scientific, such as things related to value, purpose, community, etc.\n\nPerhaps you've heard the saying: \"To a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\" People in different professions and beliefs systems tend to function this way. Production-related businesses that are led by people with a background in sales tend to inflate and overestimate the importance of the sales department relative to production. Those that are led by people with a background in (e.g.) engineering tend to overestimate the importance of production relative to the sales department, and so forth. No one is perfectly rational or perfectly objective. That's just how humans function.\n\n\"ideas and solutions are good because they work\" does not describe progressivism as it exists. It does describe pragmatism though, which is its own debate with its own set of issues.\n\nBut I think pragmatism is clearly not what you're advocating. First, it's object oriented, so whatever your definition of the optimal goal is will change what the best practices/beliefs are. Even nuanced changes in the goal will get you different prescriptions, e.g. a preference for an increased average level of material prosperity will get you to a different prescription than a preference for an increased median level of material prosperity. And is happiness for the greatest number the goal? Many people are not happy with religion, but a great many are happier through religion than they would otherwise be.\n\nSecond, and related to the last comment, what \"works\" is not synonymous with people believing in what is true. Under the right circumstances, a lie can work, and it can do so very effectively. It can get people to accomplish and do things they otherwise would not do. It can get them to behave in ways that we prefer. Etc. So pure pragmatists would disagree with you about religion, for example. They would simply ask: \"Does it work?\"\n\nYou describe ideology correctly and how people use it. My point is just that you're describing every belief system from pragmatism to humanism to secularism to scientism to capitalism, not just religion.\n\nReligion's just not that special."}, {"id": "cm0xi3r", "body": "I'm not at all religious myself, but even I can still see why certain people are.

I do too (I'm Christian).\n\n\nFirst, like others have pointed out, once you make the broad statement that \"religion is X,\" you need to be prepared to defend that statement for whatever kind of reasonable worldview I put in for \"X.\" So my first question would be: Are you knowledgeable on all of the encompassing worldviews that are \"religion\" in order to make such a claim for each individual one? If not, then your argument/belief is logically fallacious.\n\n\nAlso, I'm curious as to how you define \"social progress.\" Yes, there are certain \"values\" that are being pushed back by major worldviews, but is that necessarily a bad thing in and of itself? I think you'd be surprised at the amount of wisdom present in the doctrine of many religions.\n\n\nAs a Catholic scientist, I'd also like to respond to the comment briefly about how \"science has eroded many of the ideas of religion.\" Short answer: no it hasn't, but rather it's done the opposite. Science actually enhances theology, and vice-versa (again, a mistake that a lot of people make: making a claim like this without really thinking about it).
