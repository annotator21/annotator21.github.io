I don't need to disprove the existence of Hogwarts and Harry Potter and wizards. We treat them all as fairy tails, because all these things, while impossible to absolutely disprove, surely do not exist. \n\nWhy does the concept of particular Gods such as Allah or the \"Simulation God\" or \"Alien Jesus\" require a greater burden of disproof than Harry Potter ?\n\nWhy are you agnostic about \"God\" but an atheist towards every other magical, supernatural entity? \n\nIMO agnostics give unwarranted deference towards deities. For some reason the question of God warrants \"I don't know\", while the question of Harry Potter warrants a \"Of course it's not real!\" You do realize that the wizarding community is quite active in brainwashing anybody who has observed them; thus, observation and proof of their existence is impossible!

We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist.

You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm only arguing about semantics here. But I'm tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \n\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God.

There are surely many radical and militant Fundamentalist groups who use religion as a scapegoat for terror, and churches such as the Westboro Baptists who use religion as a scapegoat for hate crimes. Thankfully, these outliers often find push-back even within their own faiths. For the rest, the vast majority of \u201creligious\u201d people, though, I would doubt the extent of their loyalties to the scripture. Their faith is more reliant on an indoctrination through upbringing, and a human loneliness seeking community. They inject their own morals and views into their interpretation of the text. They cherry pick the lines which are convenient to them, and ignore much of the hatred, homophobia, misogyny, slavery, murder, and genocide that exists in these tomes. At that point, though, what is religion but a fa\u00e7ade? It becomes a self applied label by which you allow others the opportunity to attempt to judge your social merits. It becomes vapid and hollow, devoid of an actual meaning as merely a legitimization by argumentum-ad-populum. At that point it becomes a purely political institution: something made for patronage rather than logic. What moral guidance religion would claim to provide gets lost to perception and free will. \n\nTo that end, I'm not sure if trying to take a stance against \"God\" is worth the effort, because if you want to worship in some post-colonial bottled up and labelled kind of way then whatever, that's okay. I think it's more a form of escapism from reality, finding solace in the idea that there is an afterlife and death is not final, and that we are not alone and will not be forgotten; that we have some grander meaning in the universe. It's about feeling good more than logic, and I'm not sure how you can have a truly empirical debate with someone at that level. \n\nEdit: I would also say that agnosticism is a fairly laissez-faire stance. It's saying \"well, perhaps I lack the imagination to believe in a god, but I see no reason to dismiss it either\". It's a more laid back position which frees one from having the controversy of atheism while still not being quite theist. It sits in the middle content to let whatever side try to convince them.

After that, nobody knows.\n\nBut a scientist doesn't give up. Scientists are hard at work, at this very moment, trying to figure out how consciousness works. IMO an agnostic view of consciousness means that you can just give up and not worry about what happens. \n\nCan you seriously suggest that humans will never unlock the mysteries of consciousness? Should we just give up now? "}, {"id": "2m5qjh", "body": "Imagine you, Alex, and another man, Bob, sitting in a dark room. Bob suddenly exclaims, \"There's someone else in this room!\" Alarmed, you turn on your flashlight to look for this other man. You run about the room, trying to find him, but you cannot. You can't find the other man. You exclaim, \"What the hell are you talking about? I don't see anybody else!\" Bob just says, \"I know he's there. Just believe me!\"\n\nAfter going through the scenario above, why the hell would anybody be \"agnostic\" about the existence of a third man? As you search more and more vigorously and find no results, agnosticism quickly turns gnostic. The 3rd man doesn't exist. There's no reason to be \"unsure\" about this fact. \n\n\n\nThe same argument, IMO, can be applied to the nebulous concept known as \"God\". Sure, it's impossible to disprove the existence of God-like entities - concepts that share interesting features of God but are in no way, shape, or form any way related to the personal Gods (such as Allah or Yahweh) as believed by human society. Outside of philosophy, I don't see why anybody would be particularly interested in this form of God that has absolutely no practical consequence on humanity. What I'm interested in is the Gods that people actually believe in - the personal God that affects your daily life, that personally intervenes in your life to make it better, the one that's here to save your soul. \n\n\nI spent a good chunk of my life trying to find Yahweh or any other God. I couldn't find any sign of him whatsoever in this universe that we inhabit. And not only me, no scientist has found much of a trace of Him. Most Churches can't even find him either - instead, they must rely on Faith that He is there.\n\nIs it possible that \"personal Gods\" exist? Maybe. But as the search for that personal God continues, the probability that He exists diminishes to zero. How many times must I re-scan that dark room of Alex and Bob to ensure that the 3rd man does not exist? Every single lack of observation reaffirms the positive belief that \"No, the third man does not exist\", just like \"The Personal God does not exist\".\n\n\n\n\nWith new and updated observations of reality that continue to yield absolutely no evidence of God, the probability of the existence of God continues to diminish to zero. The discovery of classical mechanics proved that God wasn't needed to *actively* move heaven and Earth. The discovery of Evolution proved that God was not needed to actively create Life. Each new discovery reaffirms the fact that God does not intervene in the natural world using \"unnatural\" means. Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"mechanism that which drives the laws of nature\". Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"Universe\". But that sure is hell far, far away from the God of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and everyone else that believe in Gods. \n\nAtheism permits the possible existence of super-powerful, God-like creatures that may share many or even all of the features that are attributed to God. It's not unimaginable that an alien race has achieved such incredible powers to be even more powerful than the God as described in the Old Testament. These \"Gods\" may be so incredibly intelligent or powerful that they are unimaginable by human intelligence. But they're not supernatural. They're not the personal God believed by humanity that reincarnates you or whisks you off to heaven. I'm also sure you've heard of the simulation argument, that there is a \"super-universe\" on top of ours that controls us, much like how we play videogames that create \"sub-universes\" that we have near total control over. However, this version of God is in great contrast to the God imagined by most people. Most people don't believe that God is a supernatural Nerd playing his world's version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\".

True, capital doesn't come out of thin air, but raising money for such a venture is a far more realistic goal than overturning the entire socio-political system.  \n\nThere are already employee-owned businesses, and while they have their advantages, they are not nearly as revolutionary as many anarchists seem to believe their co-ops would be.

You just need to invest in the company you work at, and then you'll get your share of the profits of capital.\n\nMost people are reluctant to do this, because they understand at some level that capitalists do not make money by doing nothing, they make money by taking risks.

But if you want to refute them, you have to refute them, not just note that anarcho-communism doesn't work before the Revolution.\n\n(And by the way, it's somewhat hair-splitting, but owners of capital do get money for doing nothing.  I have a few shares of stock that my father left me, and I've never done anything with it but I still get my dividends.  Yes, the value of the stock is at risk.  And yes, risk-bearing is a real factor of production.  But you don't have to *do* anything in order to own at-risk assets.)"}, {"id": "cm27qt0", "body": "Your stocks are basically your fathers deferred consumption. And yours.

Anarchists seem to believe that the workers will be inspired to create systems that are more efficient, more humane, and all-around superior to those of capitalist businesses.\n\nMy question is, if you want to work at a collectively owned business, then what's stopping you from starting one?  There's no law against it.  True, capital doesn't come out of thin air, but raising money for such a venture is a far more realistic goal than overturning the entire socio-political system.  \n\nThere are already employee-owned businesses, and while they have their advantages, they are not nearly as revolutionary as many anarchists seem to believe their co-ops would be.  If they were more efficient, innovative, etc, they would out-compete traditional businesses in the market.\n\nIn fact, you don't even need to be part of a commune to \"own the means of production\".  You just need to invest in the company you work at, and then you'll get your share of the profits of capital.\n\nMost people are reluctant to do this, because they understand at some level that capitalists do not make money by doing nothing, they make money by taking risks.  Many people do not want to share in the risks of their workplace, with good reason.\n\nIn the current system, we have the choice between two systems.  Anarchism would force everyone into the system that the majority of people do not choose.  I do not see how this can be considered a good thing.  Please CMV.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Intentional Communities are planned communities for people who want to live differently. They vary from full on hippie communes to Libertarians buying a town to live in without interference from a local government to a small town of philosophical hedonists creating a place to do whatever it is that philosophical hedonists want to do in the absence of unenlightened public decency laws to environmentalists trying to reduce their net carbon emissions to zero. If you want you could move to one of several socialist communities.\n\nThis isn't particularly unusual historically speaking, The United States has always had people seeking to create unique living arrangements for themselves. Many of the original colonists were seeking toleration for unusual ways of life. Mormons, Amish, and any number of other religious groups created places for themselves separate from the general population to live. There have been attempts to build Utopian Communities based on everything from Social Darwinism to Socialism to Free Love and Complex Marriage. Modern Intentional Communities are simply the latest go around of experimenting with unusual living arrangements. Usually these communities fall apart in a few decades. Some, like the Amish, create stable, perpetuating communities but don't succeed in a way that leads to their neighbors adopting their methods. Others do form ideas that are promptly stolen and run with by the rest of us, like Public Schools from especially combative Connecticut Pilgrims.\n\nThat's not to say that everyone can just drop everything and stuff themselves cheek to jowl with the rest of the population in these handful of planned communities.

If you really feel this way, you should try counseling a bit to rule out basic social dysfunction illness. If you are clear of that, then you should pursue it. If you don't get that checked, it can bite you in the ass a decade down the line, probably before you made your goal.\n\nYou need to understand that if you really disregard people and stuff most other people care about (life, family, tradition), and they discover you are this way, they will shut you out really fast.

Normal people will either respect or dispise you, but the real problem is that you can not interact with them in a meaningful way. Your potential group of people who you can interact normally with will shrink drastically the further up you are. This will limit your ability to find friends or a spouse.\n\n&gt; I don't see any reason why I shouldn't want this.\n\nTo be honest, there isn't, as long as you are okay with the fact that there will be consequences. Your life would be different, but not necessarily worse or better than now. If you really want it and are mentally healthy and are clear on the consequences ... by all means, go for it!

You will find that almost every CEO on that list grew up in a middle class or upper middle class family and that almost none of them went to an Ivy League school (and if they did it was for their MBA, meaning that it wasn't through connections).\n\nThis concept that \"only the rich become CEOs\" is a falsehood perpetuated by Reddit to help create an \"us vs them\" mentality regarding the rich versus the poor. Unless you are an heir (the kid of the person who created the company) your \"connections\" generally mean very little besides maybe a slight leg up to help you get your first job. Similarly once you have your first job, nobody cares where you went to school, they care how well you are doing at your job.\n\nSo what matters far more is your aptitude and work ethic, and when you first join any big company there will be people who are there judging whether they think you have management potential or not - it is in every companies best interest to have a bullpen of people who they think would be able to step into high level positions that are often very difficult to recruit for.\n\nAll of these companies exist to turn a profit and if you are a high performing person, people will jump to promote you because when you continue to perform at a high level it will make them look like a genius for giving you the chance. Since executives at the top are responsible for thousands of people it is absolutely critical for them to have a management staff that is incredibly competent as the shareholders will judge that executive based on the performance of his division and not on the connections of the people working underneath him."}, {"id": "cm18kts", "body": "You think that the ivy educated daddy funded members of the workforce don't have better social skill set than you?"}, {"id": "cm18ofr", "body": "i think it's unfair to say they they *all* do, but i also accept that some likely do. why do we have to deal in absolutes?"}, {"id": "cm18ofr", "body": "i think it's unfair to say they they *all* do, but i also accept that some likely do. why do we have to deal in absolutes?"}, {"id": "cm18stw", "body": "I think shorthanding a overwhelming majority as an absolute is pretty fair.  Social skills and workplace social skills are tremendously different.  In the kinds of business-savvy workplaces that have $400,000+ paying jobs, politics are much more about power and favors and money.  What can you offer to the current CEO that someone with real and valuable connections can't?  Your boss makes more than you, so you can't make it money.  She/he has worked here longer and at a higher level, so they have more power than you.  By the same token they have more connections too.  What can you do to earn their favor or the favor of the highly political board or boss that chooses their replacement?  How will you make them pick you?\n\nFrom the CMV angle, there is nothing wrong with wanting tons of money, but many people find that their time is better invested elsewhere.  It truly depends on what a person values.  I have wealthy family members that wish they had started a family instead, and I have family members that wish they worked longer before they had kids.  I have family members that live only for their hobby now, hobbies that are inexpensive and didn't need such a long stressful career to finance.  \n\n\nBest move for you is to keep an open mind and be willing to reevaluate your goals.

The only way you have a shot at being crazy rich is by working your ass off, and for the amount you are talking about it means either creating or inventing something, or waiting until you are much older. \n\nYou need to be smart, but more importantly you need the motivation. Social people lacking in drive aren't going to amount to much. Frankly to have a shot at what you want you better be pretty damn smart too. Your high school grades don't mean shit anymore, but the college you go to does, and if it isn't an Ivy or equivalent level school you better sure as hell have a 4.0 or close so you can go to a prestigious grad school. \n\nIntelligence means nothing without drive. Social skills even less. Find something you like (biochem fortunately enough is a field where you do have the potential to make alot of money), and work your ass off. If you really are one of the best at what you do, you will be noticed. Slacking off din't get anyone anywhere. \n\nFew millionaires ever said \"I want to be rich\". They said \"I am going to do what I do best, and let what I do speak for itself\".\n\nFeel free to PM if you want additional personal insight as I have same experience with this.\n\n\nShort version:\n\nIt isn't about the money.

It is a research degree.  You have to spend a good 5-6 years researching a topic that you may (or may not) enjoy all that much.  Most Ph.D. degrees do end up landing you higher level jobs and such, but it is not a valid reason to go through it all.

At some point your going to have to get involved with the politics of monetary and non-monetary forms of wealth independently, which has less to do with working hard within a specific niche one might find desirable.\n\nAnyone can go out and make 400k plus if they first have the right foundation (which isn't always possible). More importantly, they must apply their efforts uniformly toward a single, overriding goal. The pure sheer _wanting_ and _desiring_ expressed here is akin to the petulance of a young child. \n\nThe problem with the \"money isn't everything\" thesis is that its false. Money is everything (with a caveat). Money (if not physically, then in concept) is 'in' all the material things that exist among us. What people might really mean is that money isn't friendships, family, or relationships; or other interpersonal, metaphysical or spiritual things that may or may not end up mattering depending on the individual---but because it doesn't define things like personal quirks or the determinants of interpersonal exchange, that doesn't mean that it shouldn't define how we navigate the world in our (financial) interactions with others.\n\nThe problem here is that wealth is static, the things that make it move and accumulate are all dependent on user actions. Money is as irresponsible as the banks that lend it frivolously, or the people that spend it loosely. If you are to drive to become wealthy you shouldn't just be static with your wealth once accumulated, you must allow it to provide basic its material support, in providing for and satisfying parameters of happiness from within its jurisdiction. \n"}, {"id": "2m5d7a", "body": "I'm a sophomore in college, Biochemistry, if it matters (you'll see why I don't think it does).

There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship--be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles--is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.

Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clich\u00e9s, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.\n\n&gt;Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings.\n\n&gt;They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing.\n\n[Here's a link](http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words) to the full text of the address if anyone's interested."}, {"id": "2m5d7a", "body": "I'm a sophomore in college, Biochemistry, if it matters (you'll see why I don't think it does).

You need to aim high.\n\nDoesn't really matter what you do, but I've read research into successful people and the single factor that jumps out is the hard work. The thing that really successful people have in common is they work harder, and they work longer, and cleverer. You make your own luck. \n\nIf you are self professed 'lazy' thats not the end of the world. There are different types of lazy. I'm lazy in that I want the easiest possible way to do anything, but one that is also the most efficient. In order to do that, I might have to do that thing hundreds of different ways to find the best way, but once I've found it i'll do it that way. Its very hard work but I'm damned if I'm going to be inefficient long term.\n\nI think successful people are 'connectors' - they know lots of people. You need to get to know a lot of people in a lot of different fields. Network, network and network. Be nice, be approachable, listen to everyone. Shut up and listen. Hang around successful connectors, work for free at the start, do favours, call them in nicely. Don't be afraid to fail.

That's what I always read and I'm not convinced.\n\nEver since I was young I have been an 'achiever'. My mother tells me of when I was six and would read the dictionary before bed some nights.

So here I am, enjoying college, but every day I think of which professor can I talk to that went to the best PhD program and can get me in three years from now. Or which internship would look the best on a resume. And how quickly I can become a millionaire after I graduate.\n\n\"Money isn't everything\", right? Well of course I don't argue with that. I just want a lot of it. I think being a billionaire would bring me the greatest satisfaction. In addition to that, power, respect and a fame of sorts are my priorities too.

If it happens, a refusal to abort isn't a restriction on bodily autonomy, and they should see the pregnancy through.

This is very contrary to human nature. I don't just mean \"humans want to have sex as often as possible,\" I mean \"even in monogamous sexual relationships (marriage, etc.), frequent or occasional sex is not just healthy, but most often is *necessary* for well-being.\n\nWhether monogamous or not, to expect people to not ever have sex unless they're 100% prepared to have a child is asking quite a bit. And I don't just mean financially/lifestyle-wise. Which brings me to point 2.\n\n2) Part of the problem is that even when men such as my self say \"yes, we bear responsibility too... we'll at least pay for the child's well-being even if we aren't there to raise them...\" this neglects the gigantic and often irreparable changes to a woman's self during and after pregnancy.\n\nMy wife is currently 7.5 months pregnant, and if this was a child we weren't prepared for, couldn't afford to have, whatever... what she has dealt with, and more importantly, what she *will have to deal with* (scars, certain bodily functions not working like they used to, possible decreased pleasure from sex, not to mention the agonizing pain of labor) are non-negligible things to weigh against when we're talking about early-stage abortions.\n\nObviously people need to be responsible and realize that sex can have repercussions, and abortions shouldn't be treated as flippantly as going to the grocery store, but the social ramifications of telling people \"no sex, unless you are going to keep a baby... and we keep ALL babies\" would be quite harmful. \n\nThe people most at risk for unwanted pregnancies are already far overlapping with the people that our society doesn't take care of. It's between asking people to simply *not have sex* or asking people to *make, carry, birth, and care for babies that may not be wanted or provided for.*\n\nFewer abortions would be ideal--more people being more responsible about sex would be ideal.

I just need to protect myself with a boost of insulin. Now let's say something goes wrong in the insulin delivery process (can happen due to a host of different factors); This is just like a condom breaking; my blood sugar is going to skyrocket, and I have to deal with it. It's my fault that my blood sugar is high, since I ate the cake to begin with, but that doesn't mean I do nothing about it and go into a coma and die. I have to take the responsibility, when I start feeling hyperglycemic, to check my blood sugar and get it under control. With an unplanned pregnancy, both parties involved are responsible for the outcome of the baby, whether they choose to keep it or abort or adopt. \n\nJust a note, I think the woman has the final say in an abortion decision, as it is her body that's at stake, but in a healthy relationship, both parties should be involved in the decision.
