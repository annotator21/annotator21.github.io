In particular, municipal broadband has been successfully lobbied against, repeatedly, by local cable companies who don't want their governments competing with them. Looking at the current pace of Google Fiber, do you really think that this alone is going to be a huge factor, even in the next ten or twenty years?\n\nAnd then what? I trust Google a hell of a lot more than I trust Comcast, but any company that large with fingers in that many pies is going to have similar conflicts of interest. The primary issue with Comcast is the conflict of interest between their role as a company that already is a TV service (and has their own streaming service), and their role as an ISP who's supposed to deliver equal access to HBO Go (which they get a cut of) and Netflix (which they don't). Well, Google has a horse or two in that race, too -- what happens if Google Play Movies suddenly work way better than Netflix?\n\nI don't think that's likely, but after getting burned so many times by our existing monopolistic ISPs, do we really want to give another ISP monopolistic power?\n\nBecause like /u/rotide said, cable company fuckery isn't just something we're afraid of. It's already happening. It could get *much* worse, but it's *already* unacceptable.\n\n&gt; In the past few years with CISPA, PIPA, SOPA, and NSA surveillance, it has become abundantly clear that the US government abhors freedom and openness on the internet.\n\nOne of these things is not like the other. Two of them, actually.\n\nCensorship and surveillance are related, but they're not the same thing.

It's definitely not in terms of just getting started. Generally, the parent company (Coca Cola for example) will provide most or all of the money to build a factory. They will also provide the money to purchase raw materials, and pay for workers. Then, there's an earnout period where the factory puts all of its profits towards paying down the borrowed money, as well as purchasing equity. If the operation is successful, (which it's often not, like if you look at the Apple and GTAT case) the factory will be completely freed from the parent company.

It's definitely not in terms of just getting started. Generally, the parent company (Coca Cola for example) will provide most or all of the money to build a factory. They will also provide the money to purchase raw materials, and pay for workers. Then, there's an earnout period where the factory puts all of its profits towards paying down the borrowed money, as well as purchasing equity. If the operation is successful, (which it's often not, like if you look at the Apple and GTAT case) the factory will be completely freed from the parent company. I don't have a specific clothing company to give you as an example, but I've come across many companies in the past that do this.\n\n&gt;These people make orders of magnitude more that they're entitled to by how much work they actually do, because things like government connections, social status, seed capital that doesn't come from loans, and education are overvalued in those countries.\n\nIs there any other solution to this?

And let me preface this.  You're getting a lot of flack for your statement about how you feel about rednecks.\n\nLet me spin that a different way.\n\n99% of what pro gun people say when they're defending guns makes me favor more gun control.  So to me, gun owners are right there among the top reasons why I am pro gun control.  Everything they say about guns makes me more pro gun control.\n\nWhich goes back to guns having the best marketing campaign ever.  Better than santa, are guns.\n\nJust look at all the pro gun people in this thread.  Listening to the people in this thread, guns don't make you captain america.  Captain america died.  Guns don't make you batman, or spiderman, or superman, they've all been beaten.  Guns make you invincible.  Guns make your family invincible.  Guns make your school invincible...\n\nThat's what more than 100 people in just this thread, and tens of millions of americans fervently believe.\n\nGun makers are selling power to the disenfranchised american people.\n\nWhat happens after de-segregation?  Gun sales skyrocket.  What happens when a black man is elected president?  Gun sales skyrocket.\n\nGuns are sold on power and fear.  And in america...  gun stores may as well be taking candy from the 100 or so babies in this thread.\n\nWhat guns aren't.  Obviously.  Is some kind of marvel super power.  Guns aren't a radioactive spider that turns you into spiderman.  They don't make you invincible.  They don't cast some magical protection spell over your family.\n\nBut guns are a $500.00 safety blanket for someone that wants power, or for someone that wants a magical pill that makes them get over any fear they have.\n\nWalking down that dark street some women don't realize that men are often roughly just as afraid as women are.  For $500.00 I can sell any man that wants to get over that fear of being vulnerable walking down a dark street a safety blanket that will get him over his fears.\n\nBringing this back to what I was going to say, one of the things that pisses me off the most, are all the pro gun men that seem bizarrely obsessed with rape.  And how the solution to rape is guns.\n\nNow not to say that a gun has never prevented a rape, but pretty much from every angle, their logic is wrong.\n\nLike any other criminal, you can't pick a rapist, or a burglar out of a crowd.  They don't have horns, or a tail, or cloven feet.\n\nThe typical scenario is wrong.  Most of these pro gun guys don't know rape statistics because they aren't educated about crime at all.  They don't know the first thing about protecting themselves.  They don't know what dangers they face.  They take comfort in that ignorance.  The less they know, the more effective their $500.00 safety blanket is.\n\nMost rapes aren't some criminal on the streets following a woman into a dark alley, which these pro gun men would know if they knew anything about self defense.  Most rapes are done by someone the victim knows, and trusts, and isn't done on the street.  And a gun would only make things worse.\n\nNot that a gun would help in the dark alley scenario, which is another thing the pro gun people don't know.  Again.  Criminals don't wear signs.  They don't give you warnings.  Any criminal with strength, or, if they don't have strength, with a rock, or a brick, or a stick, can walk up to you, and that's basically game over.\n\nLet's say john smith decides to embark on a life of crime.  He picks up a butter knife.  He walks up to your average gun owner who thinks he's rambo.  The criminal wielding a butter knife tells rambo \"give me your wallet\".  Rambo shoots the guy.\n\nEverything worked.  The gun owner \"won\"...\n\nAnd then the criminal with the butter knife and the bullet wound stabs rambo with the butter knife.\n\nI don't know about you, but I wouldn't want to be stabbed over a wallet.  And, for the record.  Although most gun owners don't know this, this is why you don't want to escalate violent situations.  The last thing you want to do is draw a deadly weapon, making you a deadly threat to a criminal.  That is not a good move to make.\n\nPlus...  all their other BS is wrong too.  99% of what pro gun people say makes me more pro gun control."}, {"id": "cm1e503", "body": "&gt;Grew up in South Florida, no accent at all (if a slight hispanic accent).

Guns are responsible for 11,000 or so deaths a year. Thats a lot and should be lower, however lets look at how many deaths alcohol is responsible for, 25,000. So you could save more lives if the gun control crowd focused on banning alcohol which really is a poison, that increases violence and ruins lives. BUT nobody wants to do that because we have tried it before and it doesnt work. It just created a criminal enterprise and people still found a way to drink. Also more people are around alcohol so they are more comfortable with it. So why ban guns? Its not the most effective way to save lives and criminals will still get their hands on and use them. \n\nBased on your stereotyping i assume you arent around guns that often. But if you were youd be a lot more comfortable with the idea of people owning guns. Sure there are people who are irresponsible gun owners but you also dont get to hear on the news about the many more gun owners who never have an accident and are completely responsible. If you were to successfully ban guns, does that mean that even police turn theirs in? If so thats more fair and reasonable than saying no they get to keep them. Because youre average gun enthusiest is going to be better trained with a firearm than a police officer. Often times police officers accomplish the bare minimum for firearms training and do not keep their skills up over a citizen that hunts or shoots as a hobby. Police officers are not as proficient as you'd like with a gun, and take long to come help you in a situation where they need to use it. They also have no legal obligation to save and protect you. They just have to get the person breaking the law. You are the one who has to be responsible for you and your families own safety.

Guns are responsible for 11,000 or so deaths a year. Thats a lot and should be lower, however lets look at how many deaths alcohol is responsible for, 25,000. So you could save more lives if the gun control crowd focused on banning alcohol which really is a poison, that increases violence and ruins lives. BUT nobody wants to do that because we have tried it before and it doesnt work. It just created a criminal enterprise and people still found a way to drink. Also more people are around alcohol so they are more comfortable with it. So why ban guns? Its not the most effective way to save lives and criminals will still get their hands on and use them. \n\nBased on your stereotyping i assume you arent around guns that often. But if you were youd be a lot more comfortable with the idea of people owning guns. Sure there are people who are irresponsible gun owners but you also dont get to hear on the news about the many more gun owners who never have an accident and are completely responsible. If you were to successfully ban guns, does that mean that even police turn theirs in? If so thats more fair and reasonable than saying no they get to keep them. Because youre average gun enthusiest is going to be better trained with a firearm than a police officer. Often times police officers accomplish the bare minimum for firearms training and do not keep their skills up over a citizen that hunts or shoots as a hobby. Police officers are not as proficient as you'd like with a gun, and take long to come help you in a situation where they need to use it. They also have no legal obligation to save and protect you. They just have to get the person breaking the law. You are the one who has to be responsible for you and your families own safety.

I'm not a gun dealer, I don't care if safety laws hurt their business. \n\nThe biggest argument against smartguns is that it's probably fairly easy to disable the mechanism and make the gun functional in the event of theft, which is the whole scenario smartguns are designed to prevent. \n\nA much better idea is tagged bullets. This puts microdots in the powder of the bullet that have a unique signature, such that when it's fired these microdots identify the exact bullet that was fired and that ammunition can be traced back to the purchaser. This is really effective at limiting gun crime. It's also really expensive, like $5 per bullet expensive, but again, I don't care if the gun dealers lose money. \n\nThis won't happen because, as you correctly point out, it will cost the arms industry sales. This is why the gun industry opposes background checks and blocking sales to terrorists. They want everyone, ESPECIALLY criminals, to be armed. For example, the current drug war in Mexico is 100% the fault of US gun dealers who are making billions off the conflict selling weapons to drug cartels. \n\nLots of heavily-armed criminals make the public more afraid and a scared public buys more guns for \"self-defense\".\n\n"}, {"id": "cm1g5va", "body": "And most, if not all gun owners, were unwilling to trade in their guns for a new one with the technology?
