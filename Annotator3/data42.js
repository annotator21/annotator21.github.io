data3={"phrases": [{"id": "2mesct", "body": "First of all, I want to say that there is room in this discussion for personal preference.  Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise.  There is music that I don't enjoy listening to, but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate.  Likewise, everyone has those guilty pleasure artists/songs where we know they're bad, but love them anyway.  In either case, there is something *about* the music that we find good, whether an infectious melody or well-constructed lyrics or a wailing solo.\n\nWhich returns me to trap.  I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing.  I can't relegate it to \"I'm not into it, but can see why others do\" because I can't see why others like it, which is why I turn to you, Reddit.  My objections are as follows:\n\n(1) Minimalism works against it.  Minimalism in music is not always bad.  I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect.  It creates a great tension-and-release element to a song and when used well is orgasmic.  This tension is a staple in the Trap \"sound\", replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody (generally speaking).  On an subjective level, this is musical blue balls, but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level.  The reason the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle.  It's like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then, well, drop you.  The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup.  Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience.  Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet, the ride drops you 50 feet.  You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation.  Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core, never rleasing the tension fully.  As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (1): The amusement park model doesn't work for Trap.  In that case, what is a better model with which to consider Trap?\n\n(2) Absence of complexity.  I'm not looking for Mozart the DJ.  Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow.  1-3 note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent.  I would like skill in my music.  Trap as a genre feeds the instrumental-fetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they don't play a \"real instrument\".  EDM can do so much more, and I've heard it do so much more.  Just never in this genre.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (2): (a)You're just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike.  Possibly, but I don't think so.  Even if the bar were set really low (like One Direction low) maybe the best choruses of Trap (that are distinctly Trap, not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D) could surpass them in terms of quality.  Maybe. (b)Other genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity.  Agreed; however no genre (aside from Ambient Drone) makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself.  (c) Simplicity is not always bad.  Agreed.  Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects.  My argument is that Trap does not.\n\nIt's likely that I won't enjoy Trap music after this thread, but I do want to understand those that do like it, and if they like it, whether they actually think it constitutes quality music.  Thank you.\n\nEdit1: Formatting\n\nEdit2: This is not \"CMV: We can make objective judgments about aesthetic matters\".  My view includes as a presupposition that there is an objective (but limited) element to the appreciation of music.\n\nEdit3: I am referring to \"Second Wave\" characterized by heavy electronic music influences, rather than the original Trap which was a Hip-Hop offshoot.\n\nEdit4: Examples incoming\n\nExample 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZB_tXP84WU This is a fairly standard (in my mind) example of Trap elements.  808 steady drone with high-hats composing the background for a melody of, lets face it, one note with some ornaments.\n\nExample 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t_eU3tdy2g Remix also including elements mentioned above.  Better than most, but only just.\n\nExample 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL9OzPY4byQ Changing up the formula a little with this one.  The downtempo nature brings something different to the table, and its minimalism actually contributes to its overall feel.  Definitely not the norm, though.\n\nExample 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYBLylKa-vI  10 songs that could serve as an adequate standard for what I mean by \"Trap\".

I've done some real thinking, thanks in large part to your critiques, and think I've changed some of the assumptions I hold which have led to the view in this thread.  I have not changed my particular view about, yes, the objective lack of quality that, if not essential to the Trap genre, is nearly universal.  What I have changed is the idea that this matters.  I'll do my best to explain myself.\n\nFirst, (1)I draw a sharp distinction between \"quality\" and \"enjoyment\".  One can enjoy poor quality music.  A couple of my mistakes were thinking that (2) there is any way to put that respectfully without sounding pejorative or like I have a stick so far up my ass that it's coming out my mouth and (3) that a lot of others share this opinion as an assumption to how they look at music.  One of my all-time favorite bands whom I love dearly has a history of poor quality music.  I love their lyrics and I love the \"sound\" that the band creates, but only recently have they proved themselves as being good technical musicians.  On the one hand, I really enjoy this band; on the other, I don't consider them extraordinarily skilled musically.  I hold both those views without cognitive dissonance.  Not many people do, though.  They equate aesthetic pleasure with aesthetic quality.\n\nAnother one of my assumptions that has been debated in this thread is that (4) we can make objective judgments about music.  This view has not changed.  This is not to say that music is wholly objective.  Furthermore, the fact that music has strong subjective elements does not negate those objective elements.  I don't enjoy a lot of music that I respect as having quality in creativity, originality, complexity, structure, etc.  Some of it I can't stand.  I still think they're quality compositions and performances.  Is there an objective qualitative difference between \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Shake It Off\"?  Of course.  Can someone find more enjoyment in \"Shake It Off\" than \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"?  Of course.  Just because the criterion for making such a claim isn't immediately obvious doesn't mean we should discount the claim.  Just as \"music is an entirely objective matter\" is false, \"music is an entirely subjective manner\" is false.\n\nSo why, if enjoyment can be separated from quality, do I voice the claim that a particular genre is of poor quality?  What's the point?  Here we come to my next assumption: (5) We, as listeners, ought to support good quality music rather than poor quality music.  I still hold this.  We expect physicians to treat afflictions well.  We expect Olympic runners to be fast.  We expect construction workers to create quality buildings that will stand strong.  Art is not so different.\n\nWhy do we think J.K. Rowling is a better author than Stephanie Meyer?  Because she created characters in meaningful relationships with depth and realistic motivations in a well-realized fantastical world rather than empty caricatures driven by shallow desires in an ambiguous and incomplete world.  That millions enjoyed Rowling's work is just as irrelevant with respect to literary quality as the fact that millions also enjoyed Meyer's work.\n\nSo I've explained what hasn't changed in my views.  I'll now explain what has.\n\n(6)Belittling an entire genre, whether in one's mind or on the internet, will aid in accomplishing (5).  This was implicit, but present as one of my presumptions.  Honestly, I should know better.  The only thing this thread would ever accomplish is to anger those who enjoy Trap.  You don't build something up by breaking it down.

Furthermore, the implied assumption, (7a)all Trap music is bad, was also shown false.  /u/KruxOfficial gave 3 examples of what I have to admit is good quality use of Trap genre conventions.

There is a diversity of purpose in music, and getting rid of those experiences wouldn't do anything to actually advance music meaningfully.\n\nLastly, (9) I have been thinking clearly and objectively in my evaluation of Trap music.  This is not to say that I reject (4).  I still think there are objective means of evaluating quality in music.  My reasoning on the basis of that assumption, however, has been of poor quality.  I give complexity, for instance, far too much weight in evaluations.  I still think it holds *some* objective weight, but clearly not as much as I have been giving it.

One of my all-time favorite bands whom I love dearly has a history of poor quality music.  I love their lyrics and I love the \"sound\" that the band creates, but only recently have they proved themselves as being good technical musicians.  On the one hand, I really enjoy this band; on the other, I don't consider them extraordinarily skilled musically.  I hold both those views without cognitive dissonance.  Not many people do, though.  They equate aesthetic pleasure with aesthetic quality.\n\nAnother one of my assumptions that has been debated in this thread is that (4) we can make objective judgments about music.  This view has not changed.  This is not to say that music is wholly objective.  Furthermore, the fact that music has strong subjective elements does not negate those objective elements.  I don't enjoy a lot of music that I respect as having quality in creativity, originality, complexity, structure, etc.  Some of it I can't stand.  I still think they're quality compositions and performances.  Is there an objective qualitative difference between \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Shake It Off\"?  Of course.  Can someone find more enjoyment in \"Shake It Off\" than \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"?  Of course.  Just because the criterion for making such a claim isn't immediately obvious doesn't mean we should discount the claim.  Just as \"music is an entirely objective matter\" is false, \"music is an entirely subjective manner\" is false.\n\nSo why, if enjoyment can be separated from quality, do I voice the claim that a particular genre is of poor quality?  What's the point?  Here we come to my next assumption: (5) We, as listeners, ought to support good quality music rather than poor quality music.  I still hold this.  We expect physicians to treat afflictions well.  We expect Olympic runners to be fast.  We expect construction workers to create quality buildings that will stand strong.  Art is not so different.\n\nWhy do we think J.K. Rowling is a better author than Stephanie Meyer?  Because she created characters in meaningful relationships with depth and realistic motivations in a well-realized fantastical world rather than empty caricatures driven by shallow desires in an ambiguous and incomplete world.  That millions enjoyed Rowling's work is just as irrelevant with respect to literary quality as the fact that millions also enjoyed Meyer's work.\n\nSo I've explained what hasn't changed in my views.  I'll now explain what has.\n\n(6)Belittling an entire genre, whether in one's mind or on the internet, will aid in accomplishing (5).  This was implicit, but present as one of my presumptions.  Honestly, I should know better.  The only thing this thread would ever accomplish is to anger those who enjoy Trap.  You don't build something up by breaking it down.  If I truly want electronic (and hip-hop) to advance in quality, I can't go around saying its developments aren't good.  It's not useful, it's not helpful, and it's not fair to the creators within the genre.\n\n(7)A genre can be essentially poor in quality.  You're absolutely right; my first argument is terrible and doesn't show anything with regards to Trap's quality.  Genre differences are style differences, and those have no bearing on quality.  My argument is bad and I feel bad.  Furthermore, the implied assumption, (7a)all Trap music is bad, was also shown false.  /u/KruxOfficial gave 3 examples of what I have to admit is good quality use of Trap genre conventions.  Do I *enjoy* them?  Not particularly.  Do I think they show care, attention to detail, and skill in combining a number of styles and expressions?  Yes.\n\n(8)Music should be judged only in itself.  /u/KarmaCasino and /u/ultrasawblade pointed to music's appropriateness in certain situations.  This is an aspect I neglect in my assessment.  Certain music is good *for* something else.  This doesn't so much deny my views as it lessens the efficacy of my evaluation, even if successful.  Do I think (8) ought to be emphasized more in our culture?  Absolutely.  But I can't hold that it is the *only* way to approach music.  I think this is in large part what you were trying to encourage in me with your evaluations(or perhaps as I considered your posts while keeping my distinction between enjoyment and quality); and without belittling me as I have done Trap.  There is a diversity of purpose in music, and getting rid of those experiences wouldn't do anything to actually advance music meaningfully.\n\nLastly, (9) I have been thinking clearly and objectively in my evaluation of Trap music.  This is not to say that I reject (4).  I still think there are objective means of evaluating quality in music.  My reasoning on the basis of that assumption, however, has been of poor quality.  I give complexity, for instance, far too much weight in evaluations.  I still think it holds *some* objective weight, but clearly not as much as I have been giving it.  I acknowledge that I have failed to adequately defend my views, although I am remiss to give up some of them entirely.  In light of my changed views, I resolve to promote quality music for the enjoyment of all, without putting down the work of others.\n\nAnd so, to you, /u/-HZ-, I give my Delta. &amp;#8710;"}, {"id": "cm94nij", "body": "For the second half of your post - it's great that you are able to reflect on your own views, scrutinise them and transform them so as to improve your outlook and clear your thought process somewhat; this ability is admirable.\n\nFor the first half of your post, which was mainly about whether music can have an *objective* quality and that we can assess this: it is certainly possible that music has an objective quality, but how this quality is assessed would be completely based on the intended and interpreted functions/purposes of the music as each function would demand more of one characteristic and less of another. An example would be the function of providing enjoyment vs the function of communicating a profound message - the former would have the use of sounds to create a desired feeling as one of the main aspects of its 'quality' while the latter would have clarity and innovation as a main part of the quality; these are only two examples out of an unknown but extremely large amount of possible functions. The fact that the quality could be assessed by both *interpreted* and *intended* functions/purposes also adds another extremely large amount of variables to assess. Even if you want to disregard the *intended* part of this, the amount would be too large to count. Furthermore if one were to find some sort of way to assess the *objective* quality of music that doesn't require any subjective input then it would be represented by a matrix of objective functions(based on all possible purposes that music could have) that would be essentially impossible to represent or calculate. This is all without even defining and justifying any criteria. It's better to just leave music to subjective evaluation, right?"}, {"id": "2mesct", "body": "First of all, I want to say that there is room in this discussion for personal preference.  Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise.  There is music that I don't enjoy listening to, but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate.

In either case, there is something *about* the music that we find good, whether an infectious melody or well-constructed lyrics or a wailing solo.\n\nWhich returns me to trap.

It creates a great tension-and-release element to a song and when used well is orgasmic.  This tension is a staple in the Trap \"sound\", replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody (generally speaking).  On an subjective level, this is musical blue balls, but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level.  The reason the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle.  It's like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then, well, drop you.  The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup.  Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience.  Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet, the ride drops you 50 feet.  You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation.  Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core, never rleasing the tension fully.  As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (1): The amusement park model doesn't work for Trap.  In that case, what is a better model with which to consider Trap?\n\n(2) Absence of complexity.  I'm not looking for Mozart the DJ.

EDM can do so much more, and I've heard it do so much more.  Just never in this genre.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (2): (a)You're just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike.  Possibly, but I don't think so.  Even if the bar were set really low (like One Direction low) maybe the best choruses of Trap (that are distinctly Trap, not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D) could surpass them in terms of quality.  Maybe. (b)Other genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity.  Agreed; however no genre (aside from Ambient Drone) makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself.  (c) Simplicity is not always bad.  Agreed.  Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects.

The reason the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle.  It's like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then, well, drop you.  The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup.  Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience.  Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet, the ride drops you 50 feet.  You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation.  Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core, never rleasing the tension fully.  As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (1): The amusement park model doesn't work for Trap.  In that case, what is a better model with which to consider Trap?\n\n(2) Absence of complexity.  I'm not looking for Mozart the DJ.  Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow.  1-3 note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent.  I would like skill in my music.

EDM can do so much more, and I've heard it do so much more.  Just never in this genre.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (2): (a)You're just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike.  Possibly, but I don't think so.  Even if the bar were set really low (like One Direction low) maybe the best choruses of Trap (that are distinctly Trap, not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D) could surpass them in terms of quality.

Likewise, everyone has those guilty pleasure artists/songs where we know they're bad, but love them anyway.  In either case, there is something *about* the music that we find good, whether an infectious melody or well-constructed lyrics or a wailing solo.\n\nWhich returns me to trap.  I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing.  I can't relegate it to \"I'm not into it, but can see why others do\" because I can't see why others like it, which is why I turn to you, Reddit.  My objections are as follows:\n\n(1) Minimalism works against it.  Minimalism in music is not always bad.  I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect.  It creates a great tension-and-release element to a song and when used well is orgasmic.  This tension is a staple in the Trap \"sound\", replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody (generally speaking).  On an subjective level, this is musical blue balls, but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level.  The reason the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle.  It's like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then, well, drop you.  The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup.  Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience.  Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet, the ride drops you 50 feet.  You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation.  Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core, never rleasing the tension fully.  As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (1): The amusement park model doesn't work for Trap.  In that case, what is a better model with which to consider Trap?\n\n(2) Absence of complexity.  I'm not looking for Mozart the DJ.  Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow.  1-3 note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent.  I would like skill in my music.  Trap as a genre feeds the instrumental-fetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they don't play a \"real instrument\".  EDM can do so much more, and I've heard it do so much more.  Just never in this genre.\n\nPossible rebuttal to (2): (a)You're just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike.  Possibly, but I don't think so.  Even if the bar were set really low (like One Direction low) maybe the best choruses of Trap (that are distinctly Trap, not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D) could surpass them in terms of quality.  Maybe. (b)Other genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity.  Agreed; however no genre (aside from Ambient Drone) makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself.  (c) Simplicity is not always bad.  Agreed.  Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects.  My argument is that Trap does not.\n\nIt's likely that I won't enjoy Trap music after this thread, but I do want to understand those that do like it, and if they like it, whether they actually think it constitutes quality music.  Thank you.\n\nEdit1: Formatting\n\nEdit2: This is not \"CMV: We can make objective judgments about aesthetic matters\".  My view includes as a presupposition that there is an objective (but limited) element to the appreciation of music.\n\nEdit3: I am referring to \"Second Wave\" characterized by heavy electronic music influences, rather than the original Trap which was a Hip-Hop offshoot.\n\nEdit4: Examples incoming\n\nExample 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZB_tXP84WU This is a fairly standard (in my mind) example of Trap elements.  808 steady drone with high-hats composing the background for a melody of, lets face it, one note with some ornaments.\n\nExample 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t_eU3tdy2g Remix also including elements mentioned above.  Better than most, but only just.\n\nExample 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL9OzPY4byQ Changing up the formula a little with this one.  The downtempo nature brings something different to the table, and its minimalism actually contributes to its overall feel.  Definitely not the norm, though.\n\nExample 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYBLylKa-vI  10 songs that could serve as an adequate standard for what I mean by \"Trap\".  Note that my argument is not that all sound the same, but that the similar features are the defining features of Trap, and that those features in themselves constitute poor music."}, {"id": "cm4zogx", "body": "&gt;Trap is objectively bad music\n\nBut it gets the people going. \n\n\"Good music\" is relative. I hate \"trap music\" when I have a headache and and/or driving to work. I'd rather zone out on classical or mellow jazz or Enya or FKA Twigs. \n\nBut I hate classical when I'm trying to take shots and \"turn up\" for a party unless that classical is mashed up with trap music. Haha.  \n\nYou're attempting to objectify what people find sonically enjoyable.

It's kind of a dorky shirt, but hey, I don't judge.  It's probably not appropriate for your TV interviews as a representative of the scientists that just put a rover on a comet, but again, your choices are yours.  But the backlash against this poor guy was such that he apologized, crying, for ever daring to wear the thing.  He was lambasted and belittled, all for daring to have zero fashion sense.\n\nThis seems utterly ridiculous to me, and also, I feel, presents something of a double standard.  I think if a woman had shown up in the public eye in that outfit, she would at worst have been called tasteless.  In some circles she likely even would have been lauded.  In my eyes, that's hypocrisy at it's height, and I do not approve.  Our movement is supposed to be about equality, not about bullying.  \n\n\nI would love for you to explain why I'm wrong.\n\nEDIT:  I have to head to bed, but thanks for the great answers so far!

These are the biologically sexual differences between what men find attractive in women and women find attractive in men. Yes, you can list many attractors, but the tendencies, and the sexually selective reasons for existing, are well understood. Men do like looking at scantily clad women. If somebody finds that offensive, then shame on them. That has absolutely nothing to do with misogyny but rather what sexes find attractive in each other.\n\n&gt; The discussion really needs to focus on how this man, who wore this tshirt\n\nNo, it does not. The fact that they attacked him is bad enough. But they didn't attack him because *that man* wore it; it was an attack on *any man* wearing it. It's a subgroup of misandrous women deciding what men can or can't wear, particularly if based on demonstrations of male sexual interest.\n\nIt is an exact analog to what the efforts of women in the SlutWalk, in anti-slutshaming, and in promoting pride in women's sexuality. Men should not feel ashamed to show their sexuality and sexual interests, nor be shamed based on the other sex telling them what is appropriate. None of these women complaining, nor in the movements above, would accept it if it were men trying to shame a woman in the reverse role.\n\n&gt; that he's part of a culture that's generally ignorant to its own perpetuation of sexism. \n\nWhich is exactly what you and these complaining women are doing. This guy did absolutely nothing wrong outside of fashion criticism. On the one hand demanding that women can wear what they want, regardless of what men thing, or of anyone's offense, and not be shamed by it, and then to go and do that exact thing to a man -- that is blatant sexism. And you seem completely unaware of or your own perpetuation of this sexism. I'm certain the complainers are unaware of theirs.\n\nI choose to stand up to this bullying. I won't be treated as a second-class citizen, being told to be ashamed of my sexual interests and with a dress code that must be approved by authoritarian oversight. That is hugely illiberal and sexist.\n\nAnd no, this is not *me* being sexist. I believe in complete equality and meritocracy. I am demanding only the same rights as these women and the same treatment. They would not, and do not, accept this type of behaviour when it is done to women and they should not be perpetuating it against men.\n"}, {"id": "cm3tzq5", "body": "&gt;What? Hold on a second.

There's no gene for \"looking at scantily clad women\". But yes, looking at porn and other sexualised things is OK. Wearing a tshirt depicting these things, in public, is quite another issue. If this guy was beating off to the tshirt in the privacy of his own room, fine, that's an aspect of his sexuality. Slightly odd, but I'm not about to shame anybody for their sexual proclivities, provided they aren't harming anyone else. But by placing it in a public space, it takes this objectification of women out of the realm of private sexuality, and into society.\n\nI'm not a prude. At all. In fact, I'm sex-positive. There is a time and place for the sexual objectification of women, and men for that matter, and that is when those men and women consent to it. When you wear a tshirt like that, you are objectifying women in a more general sense, and in a sense that is impossible to consent to.\n\nThe direct equivalent would be a woman wearing a tshirt that said \"I only fuck guys with big dicks\" or something. Which would be totally inappropriate to wear. \n\n&gt;When women judge men by their jobs, their income, their status, do we say they are degrading men?

Men should not feel ashamed to show their sexuality and sexual interests, nor be shamed based on the other sex telling them what is appropriate. None of these women complaining, nor in the movements above, would accept it if it were men trying to shame a woman in the reverse role.\n\nIt is quite fundamentally different to the Slutwalk. Slutwalk was a reaction to people (both male and female) suggesting that skimpy clothing causes women to be more likely to be raped. That suggestion is entirely, completely, 100% wrong. In fact, there's evidence that wearing \"slutty\" clothing actually REDUCES your chances of being raped, as rapists are more likely to target women they see as less confident. But that's beside the point. Women wearing slutty clothing affects nobody but themselves.\n\nIn short, Slutwalk was about defending a woman's right to wear clothing that sexualises THEMSELVES. This guy was wearing clothing that sexualised OTHERS. Can you see the difference? If he'd been wearing ass-less chaps, you can bet feminists would have been defending his right to wear that.\n\n&gt;Which is exactly what you and these complaining women are doing.

That doesn't change the fact that his attraction to scantily clad women, while normal, is not something that should be broadcast on national TV. The casualness with which both men and women (because remember, it was a woman who gave him the shirt) are able to reduce women to their bodies in completely non-sexual contexts is the issue here, and it's a symptom of broader problems with sexism."}, {"id": "cm36m88", "body": "That would be horrific.

It's just as inappropriate to show up in a bathing suit, or pajamas. Certainly this guy was dressed inappropriately for an office job; that's not the issue. The issue was that he was attacked for it being *sexist*. There's nothing sexist about liking to look at scantily clad women. That is the baseline of male sexuality and it is nothing to be ashamed of. Nor should women be ashamed of their sexuality or sexual interests. It is inappropriate to display them at work, yes, even for women. But again, that isn't the issue here.\n\nBut this wasn't an office job. This was a once-in-a-lifetime event -- a world's first, and the fruition of a decade or more of work. It isn't \"Wednesday at the office\". People do unique and meaningful things to mark those occasions. Canadian astronaut Steve MacLean wore a Canadian hockey jersey at NASA Mission Control the day he was Capcom for fellow Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield installing the Canadarm2 to the International Space Station, using the shuttle's Canadarm. A hockey jersey is also not appropriate office attire, but it was meaningful for a meaningful event.\n\nIn this case, Dr. Taylor wore a birthday gift shirt given to him by a close (female) friend, based on his quirky and tacky wardrobe. To him it shows scientists and engineers as less stuffy and more fun, something we actually need more of. It was a quirky thing, and with some sentimental value. There is nothing sexist about wearing the shirt. It took no rights from women, made no suggestion that women were of lesser importance. The content of the shirt was simply a tacky and cheesy display, no different if it were Velvet Elvis or dogs playing cards. \n\nThat people would call it sexist is the problem. If a woman wears a jersey of a men's sports team, is she saying that all men are good for is playing sports -- that this all they can contribute? Of course not. It is simply wrong to say this is sexist.\n\n&gt; The main way my gender was thought of was T&amp;A.\n\nHold on. The problem wasn't that women were (and are) though of in terms of beauty. The problem was that women weren't as actively thought of, or treated, as being competent in other areas. There is nothing wrong with thinking of the opposite sex in terms of things that attract you. Nobody complains when women think of men in terms of athleticism, income, status in society, charisma, and other features that tend to be attractors to women, including the physical (\"tall, dark, and hansome\"). *Only* thinking in those terms is bad, and that is what was sexism that we've overcome.\n\nIf somebody could show Dr. Taylor actually treating female coworkers as sex objects, or less than competent due to their gender -- that would be sexist. A shirt of pin-up girls is, at worst, inappropriate attire; but given the importance of this event we all give leeway to personal, meaningful exceptions to rules we set for day-to-day activities such as decorum and formalness. \n\nPeople wept and hugged when they succeed. That too is not appropriate behaviour for the day-to-day office. We allow them these exceptions for such meaningful events. Except for the killjoys and the offense-junkies, apparently.\n"}, {"id": "cm3d64l", "body": "Sexuality is neutral.  It can be portrayed in many ways.

If this company would let an employee *go on international media wearing that shirt,* then what sort of corporate culture are they creating the rest of the time?\" And the response to them was, \"Why are you bullying this man for bringing us science and space? You're weak and ridiculous if you feel that this shirt could be part of a culture that discourages women's participation.\"\n\nBut a lot of women would feel uncomfortable around that shirt in a professional environment. *I* would feel uncomfortable around that shirt, if my boss or coworker were wearing it while at work. Why are those feelings of discomfort invalid? At what point would you, personally, believe that I'm allowed to feel uncomfortable by workplace attire that aggressively sexualizes women? When the naked women are wearing leashes? When the person wearing the shirt is watching porn? When the women on the shirt are carrying signs that say \"one of the primary functions of women is to look sexy\"?\n\nThe fact that shirt exists is not sexist. The fact the shirt was designed by a woman has nothing whatsoever to do with whether it is sexist or not. And the issue isn't whether anyone ever wanted to oppress women. The issue is raising awareness of why certain actions work environments that unintentionally make women (or other groups) feel unwelcome."}, {"id": "cm3huig", "body": "The part that annoyed me was seeing people who before have argued against judging women for dressing sexily and the horrible \"she was asking for it with what she was wearing\" lines that have sparked full protests in the past, being involved in this, but I see them many of the same people I saw then saying this guy 'deserved' the harassment he got, that his tearful apology was 'good', and generally looking down on him no matter what, either as a sexist asshole or as a pitiful naive fool. Either one is horrible to think of someone.\n\nBut the thing that really bothers me is that those speaking against him willingly distort the facts just to make him a more 'just' target. Example: \"wearing a shirt that features naked women in bondage\" Where the hell did that come from? It's women who are not even half naked, wearing tight leather. It's not 'bondage', that's absurd. They're not nude. If they were outside on a hot summer day in Florida they would be over-dressed. They are posing in things that would have only been considered 'risque' 70 years ago, in the exact era when the pin-up style the designer of the shirt was trying to emulate was used to make things that were 'risque' for that time.\n\nIt's all absurd. Women dress in more revealing clothes and even more provocative clothes in public all the time because it's not a problem. There have been protests and marches against people saying women should dress a certain way and cover up more! The term 'slut-shaming' was coined to battle the idea that women shouldn't be criticized for dressing, say, how the women in that shirt were dressing, but many of the same people who marched in those protests are the ones who jumped on this guy over his shirt.\n\nWas it informal given what he was doing? Yes. It was tasteless at best but based on his tattoos you can tell that's never been a thing to matter to him. Criticizing him for that is one thing, it's unimportant but still a fault of his. The full on \"bully him until he cries\" part is just absurd though. This should not have been news at all. This should have just been a minor criticism someone made. \n\nIt's like someone gave a puppy in a dog show a spiked collar that said \"fuck\" on it. Fine. Having a puppy in a collar like that in such an environment and on tv is not a bright idea. But what happened was people didn't simply say that, they went over and started kicking the puppy until it was a whimpering mess, then they said it was good because the puppy learned its lesson.\n\nMeanwhile everyone is looking at the brutal beating being given and they're like \"what the hell is wrong with you? Why are you kicking a puppy over this? Are you insane?!\" It's like a number of people worried about social issues have gone mad on their own and no one noticed, and their madness is only just starting to show to everyone else.

I stated that I have seen very different numbers. That is not anecdotal any more than what you said.\n\nI was not the person you asked that question and didn't feel a need or desire to answer, I was addressing the point that I addressed.\n\nTo answer it though, I think the amount of extrapolation to go from a shirt with scantily clad women holding guns to questioning what 'message' he's trying to say with it is frankly 'absurd'. I would like to counter that by pointing you to how much of a double standard even thinking that of him is. If someone said a women wearing a revealing outfit is sending a message to excuse sexual harassment then we would agree the person saying that is being absurd at best, but more likely being something much worse overall. (note, I am not comparing the issues in general, just as far as they fall on the specific argument I am addressing)\n\nThe fact is that he is sending no message. He thinks it is a cool shirt and the only message that sends is that he has no taste at all on what looks cool. It only offends my eyes with its tackiness. We know now that the message he meant to send was \"look at this cool shirt a friend of mine made and gave to me! Isn't her art amazing?\" so the whole argument of \"sending messages\" becomes even more absurd.\n\nIf you actually think that someone in your workplace wearing something like that is sending a message of not respecting women, and other people only finding it funny or ridiculous because of its tackiness, then my opinion is that you assume too much of intent of others based on meaningless things of no consequence. A women does not send the message that she should be hit on just because she's showing a little skin. This guy is not sending a message that he thinks badly of women because he wears a shirt with women in sexy outfits. A women wearing sexy clothes is not a women without respect, so whether it's an actual woman wearing them or a guy wearing a picture of a women wearing them then it's in no way keeping women out of his field. That is absurd.\n\nHell, they're holding guns, wearing dominatrix garb, and some look more like super hero outfits than anything strictly sex related. The message that sends is that when it comes to women, the person wearing this shirt is attracted to the ones who have power. Is finding empowered women attractive wrong now? Is the only real crime that men find any women at all attractive? No. That is also absurd.\n\n\nEDIT: I'd like to invoke Hanlon's razor: \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" Do not assume these sorts of things are signs of a person having ill feelings or lack of respect for women. They might even think they are empowering women by wearing such things.

I do love the idea, however, that we have potato sack badasses fighting next to wrinkly, heavier badasses fighting next to attractive, barely dressed badasses.\n\nAlso, based on your first post -- I do think that a top female scientist wouldn't get chewed out for the genderswapped version, but she would get chewed out for sweatpants that say 'juicy' on them / 'objectifying' herself, even if she believes that they make her feel sexy and confident for whatever reason. So it's more to do with how we approach women's sexuality vs. men's sexuality, how we approach them in nerd culture, and how we approach feeling confident, and how to own your sexuality rather than having it own you.
