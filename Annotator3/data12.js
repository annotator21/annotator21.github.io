So if acceptance, if not encouragement, of being arrested is considered good by a community, it isn't a very big leap to think the community of people who like rap also accept or encourage crime. \n\nThis would show up in the statistics as black people having higher crime rates because a larger percentage of black people enjoy the rap music than non-black people (and therefore the culture that encourages crime?). In no way is this genetic because everyone can be subject to this culture and the ideas behind it.\n\nBut tack this idea alongside the \"acting white\" story, and my view becomes that black people systematically encourage each other to not follow the law.\n\nAll of this is definitely open to change.

Notably, convicted criminals have a low average IQ.\n\nThese traits, while not completely genetic, certainly have a substantial genetic component. IQ, in particular, is highly heritable at individual level in first world countries (it is believed that in third world countries differences in environmental factors are more extreme, thus reducing the heritability).\n\nAfrican Americans have an average IQ of 85 (one standard deviation below the national average of 100). Hispanics have average IQ 89, whites 103, and Asian Americans 106.  \nIt is not clear whether these racial IQ differences are due to genetics, culture, other environmental factors (e.g. pollution, parasites), or a combination of thereof. We can't however dismiss genetic factors out of hand.\n\n&gt; A person's wealth is not determined by culture, why would someone choose to remain poor?\n\nThere are indeed some cultures which encourage individuals to remain poor: Gypsy cultures in Europe, for instance.  \nIn the case of ghetto culture, it's not that it actively encourages poverty, but it perpetuates memes which are harmful to personal success: academic achievement is denigrated as \"acting white\", while crime is glamorized. Relatively lax sexual mores combined with low usage of contraceptives lead to large number of children raised by single mothers.

Racial profiling does not happen everywhere. Police use eccentric zones to target high-crime neighborhoods where they are most likely to come up with weapons and drugs. They are not just going to swing through an upper-class neighborhood and stop a black man with his kids. It functions on a basis of probability. There's a greater chance that a group of young black guys in gang colors in a low class neighborhood are up to no good. I'd rather the officer stop them and make sure it's all good than to let them go and commit a crime. Worst comes to worst, they have nothing and they are let go.

I'd like a genuine retort to what I just said.

THEY WOULDNT HAVE A PROBLEM! (Again, I'm not talking about all black people. Just the ones in low-class neighborhoods - which there is a lot of)\n\nSince you're so obsessed with OP's point... I think the biggest tragedy to come out of this is that black-on-black crime is a far bigger issue than police-on-black crime. Where are the priorities?

This includes things that have nothing to do with Ferguson for example justifying the killing of Tamir Rice and blaming a 12 year old for his own death (which i cannot find at the moment but will continue looking). General comments about \"thugs\", \"moral integrity\" etc. all whilst in reference to black people. Also a highly upvoted stormfront copy-pasta (which I have found [now](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2ngyrd/in_ferguson_what_officers_are_really_facing_watch/cme04yq) which essentially says that black people commit the most crime whilst implying it has to do with innate characteristics of black people rather than economic factors.

The target audience is usually people who know a lot of background info, people who have the complete picture. Not a huge stretch to assume that you're not that into art.

Would-be critics know that it takes high qualifications to truly understand science. That's not the case with art. People tend to think that having eyes is enough of  a qualifier to objectively judge art, when in fact you have to be very familiar with art history, relevant techniques, recent works in the particular field/style, the art world zeitgeist, and probably other stuff. \n\nArt is very much a statement, not just the physical appearance and aesthetics.

Jackson Pollack's works are usually [about the size of a whole wall](http://i.imgur.com/gqjT7fu.jpg).

Start by assuming what you are experiencing is exactly what the artist intended.  Then ask why the artist made the choices she did.  Why deep blue instead of bright blue.  In some ways there is a graphic language involved in visual art that relies or defies cultural norms, like red being a warning or danger or soft, rounded shapes being associated with calm or peaceful emotions.\n\nThe reason that art is chosen for museums and galleries, imho, is that someone has found the art to be successful in evoking something new or in doing it in a new and different way.  I think that good art tends to succeed in two dimensions, first in novelty and second in transcendence.  Abstract art was a new way of painting that defied the norms that came before.  What is impressive about the blank canvas isn't that it was technically difficult, it's that it was the first time someone thought about the blank canvas as an artistic statement and had the audacity to present it that way.  What makes Picasso and Monet so famous is they did things in a way that hadn't been done before.  They skewed the way in which we viewed art.  Their success was due more to the way in which they thought, than in the technique they employed.  Transcendence is the ability of a piece to cross boundaries, such as time and culture.  One of the reasons that Shakespeare is such a successful playwright is that his works still speak to us even 400 years after he died.  He touched on topics like love and power and intrigue that are as relevant to the 21st century as they were to the 17th.  \n\nMaybe we should be asking why isn't the toddler's finger painting a successful piece of art?"}, {"id": "2nid9k", "body": "I've gotten into a number of discussions about the validity of certain types of modern art, those being ones such as a blank canvas, or random splats with no thought behind it.  \nPeople generally say that art is meant to be evocative, and I understand this, but when I [can't tell it apart from something a toddler did](http://www.sporcle.com/games/bam_thwok/toddler-art-or-modern-art1?sc=thisorthat), I can't help but feel there's no work or meaning behind it beyond what I'm imprinting purely because I expect there to be a meaning.  \nI could imprint meaning onto anything that way - that doesn't make it art.

To-day, however, this seems to be totally eschewed and the result is a system that, to me, feels incredibly casual and often vulgar or insulting to the splendour of the Heavens. This is not out of any sort of mysticism but simply respect for natural beauty. Examples of recent names include ~~*3904 Honda* for an automobile company~~, *821 Fanny* which is either vulgar or puerile depending on which side of the Atlantic you are on, and names which are utterly trivial such as *3742 Sunshine* and *4735 Gary*. An asteroid is not your new pet.\n\nThis is really something trivial and it obviously isn't a major issue for me, but it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth that Man sees fit to name these celestial bodies on a whim; it feels callous. Personally I feel it better just to have systematic names only rather than these petty nick-names. Change my view.\n\n***Edit:*** I have been happily informed that *3904 Honda* has not been named for the company but for an astronomer; I cannot object to the name now. The issue of uncertain etymology has also been raised and I concede it. Still, there are many trivial or ephemeral names in existence that I continue to oppose.

I would challenge anyone to come up with 600,000 unique, historically significant names, without dipping into modern-day figures or pop culture references, all of which had more impact on society than anyone from the present.  With that in mind, we still need to choose between sequential numbering and English word naming for a very large majority of asteroids - both of which are quite meaningless, but at least word naming offers the benefits of accessibility and relatability I mentioned above.    \n\n&gt; In chemistry, newly-discovered elements have their names deliberated and argued on for years before decided upon, but nobody would dare suggest beatleium to inspire the next generation of chemists.

Given that context, it seems like the galactic equivalent of giving an especially meaningful name to every single individual grain of sand here on earth.\n\nWith those three things in mind, I think the benefits I've mentioned earlier (relatability to the average person, increasing interest and awareness in scientific fields) far outweigh the harms of an ineloquent name."}, {"id": "cmdt1n5", "body": "\u2206 \u2014 You have changed my views, at least to some extent; I acknowledge my folly and ignorance for *Honda*, for example, and am actually quite relieved I was mistaken.

This is not out of any sort of mysticism but simply respect for natural beauty. Examples of recent names include ~~*3904 Honda* for an automobile company~~, *821 Fanny* which is either vulgar or puerile depending on which side of the Atlantic you are on, and names which are utterly trivial such as *3742 Sunshine* and *4735 Gary*. An asteroid is not your new pet.\n\nThis is really something trivial and it obviously isn't a major issue for me, but it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth that Man sees fit to name these celestial bodies on a whim; it feels callous. Personally I feel it better just to have systematic names only rather than these petty nick-names. Change my view.\n\n***Edit:*** I have been happily informed that *3904 Honda* has not been named for the company but for an astronomer; I cannot object to the name now. The issue of uncertain etymology has also been raised and I concede it. Still, there are many trivial or ephemeral names in existence that I continue to oppose. Perhaps some kind of systematic evaluation down the list of existing names and for new names is in order; a precise solution of some sort certainly exists.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It means that good and serious arguments for something that might be consider feminist (kind of a very vague term but I think everyone can understand it) are going to take a long time as soon as you want to support it by facts because not everything is white and black. If you take the issue on whether or not there is a wage gap for example linking studies about 70c/$ is highly misleading however at the same time most feminists consider that the ones at 97c/$ once accounted for everything are just as misleading because they consider that women weren't offer the same choices and opportunity as men mostly based on their sex. If you want to make a good argument with studies supporting your claim it's going to take you days to right and it take a fairly long time to read. What's more if someone want to make a counter argument of equal quality it's going to take them just as long and as it will take hour(s) to read it both argument the number of people potentially interested by it drop to a fraction of something taking 2minutes. At the end of this you will mostly likely still have to concede that we are far from equality, even though you will have put forth arguments explaining why most of isn't due to discrimination, and even if you are right and your argument was better the conclusion will be in ton of grays as nearly all worthwhile arguments are.\n\nOn the other hand if you want to make an argument against feminist you can pick up something on tumbler about someone wanting to use the pronoun pi/pa/po and claiming to be an otter and it will take you 10s to point out how wrong their are and everyone will agree with you because frankly it's hard to take an otter seriously. Which mean that nobody will pass on your argument because it's too long or stop in the middle because they are bored and in fact the whole thing was so short that you even have time left to push your own ideas behind it. It's always easier to argue against someone crazy and frankly it's a lot more entertaining.\n\nIt's not that feminists movement as a whole stopped doing anything and went insane all together it's just that the ones being constructive are a lot less public (and to be frank it apply to feminist, you just have to say something insane and people will talk a lot about you, some politicians are running uniquely based on that) because it's a lot less flashy and it simply take too long to argue against them to be worth the trouble in many cases."}, {"id": "2nhwef", "body": "Who I am: Person of color, male, straight.

Or do we admit that there are good points to trying to treat humans with respect?\n\nDo we dismiss all of feminism because there are some idiots spouting thoughtless non-sense on the internet?  Or do we accept that maybe we should think about if we are treating women fairly?\n\nAnyway, I would challenge you to think about **why** you are so eager to dismiss **all** of feminism over the actions of a few nutjobs.  \n\nWhat is more likely, that these nutjobs are representative of the movement, or that you don't actually understand the movement and its philosophies?"}, {"id": "cmdqqh9", "body": "&gt; the Social Justice folks were smug, self-aggrandizing, and self-victimizing. \n\nThese are your opinions only.

Ask your source for an opinion on \"rape culture\" or 'mansplaining.'For reference, the concept of \"rape culture\" is based on widely debunked statistics from studies that count things like falling asleep in a lover's arms as rape.\n\n&gt; As for 'manspaining,' feminists contend that the phrase was needed so its gendered nature can be ignored.

If you want \"equality,\" I can give it to you. But my equality is very different from yours. \n\n&gt;This is not related to the topic at hand, just a comparison that I'm using.\n\nSame here. I can speak metaphorically too, you know.\n\n&gt; Gender Equity in Education act is passed because of the third wave.\n\nI know nothing of Taiwan, so I can't speak on the matter.

Not a single feminist was involved in the process.

Moreover, I demand evidence that this is the basis for the reduced presence of women in any fields. \n\n&gt;Please source this?\n\nThe easiest place to start would be the First Wave. Most men had barely gotten the right to vote themselves at the time, and they had to pay the price of conscription into the military. Women, on the other hand, had, and continue to have, no such requirements. There weren't even equivalent social responsibilities attached to the right. They asked, and they received just like that.

It all started as one random tweet, an observation from a random person. By the time any feminist opinion leaders started focusing on it, the issue was not the shirt but the \"shirtstorm\" backlash. [This article](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/shirtgate-was-about-more-than-a-tacky-shirt) is a good example of that.\n\nAs far as there is such a thing as an organized \"feminist movement\", no one in it was actively trying to spend dozens of articles, and thousands of tweets on such a petty issue. Not even \"extremists\", or \"assholes\". \n\nThis is just how social media works, and how all these \"gendergates\" will go on from now on: Some woman makes a personal observation (that you may or may not dsagree with, it's irrelevant), then dozens post her misogynistic slurs, then The Verge writes an article about it, then redditors start a subreddit against her, then she gets defended by celebrities, then other celebrities tweet against her, then she is invited to CNN to talk about her experience, etc. etc. \n\nBy the time you look around, it looks like either feminists or anti-feminists (depending on how you look at it) have just misguidedly \"chosen\" to spend an awful lot of effort on making a silly point, while it's really just uncontrolled mob physics. \n\nOther social issues will also follow a similar pattern of escalation. \n\n&gt; We've granted power to words by creating phrases like \"trigger warning\" and we coddle our members rather than empowering them.\n\n\nIt's not us who granted power to works, but human psychology that PTSD happens to be a part of, and that's traumatic shocks can be triggered by words, among other things.\n\nThe people who are outraged about trigger warnings are no different from the ones who think we are coddling kids with too many allergy warnings, or that we are coddling epileptics with epilepsy warnings. It's purely malicious backlash against inclusivity, and against trying to make like a bit more bearable for the most endangered amongst us."}, {"id": "2nhwef", "body": "Who I am: Person of color, male, straight.

While it is true in certain circumstances, [men can be, and](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lohl1/why_the_word_patriarchy_is_just_a_bigoted_slur/) [are discriminated against](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/uwekw/facts_and_statistics_detailing_male_oppression/) in others.\n\nThe basis of radical feminism is that there is a Patriarchy in Western culture that systemically oppresses women. This, I think, is an oversimplification, caused by the tendency to look at similarities and what you want to see and not the nuance of society and culture. One gender does not have it better than the other in all ways, but radical feminists (a hypothetical one, I'm not saying anything about real people) insist that they do.\n\nSo I think a lot of this stems from Patriarchy Theory and the oversimplification it has caused. It makes people believe that women are second-class citizens in every way, and it leads to a distorted view of current events. Coddling members seems perfectly natural if you think that everyone else hates them."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2nhvh5", "body": "\"All drugs should be legal\" is a very popular view on reddit, or at least its proponents are very vocal here.

I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance, I personally don't use marijuana but I believe it's ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco, much more harmful and addictive drugs, are legal. This CMV applies to crack, heroin, powder cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, etc. I'm opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think it\u2019s a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery.\n\nThe main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. I've heard a lot of vague arguments that we should \"tax and regulate\" these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want, but you\u2019ll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case.\n\nCurrently, there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users, and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get. This is DESPITE the fact that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful and addictive than marijuana. Sure, you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on it if you really want to, but the law does deter millions. Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college, knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the 7-11?\n\nI understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available, but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law, and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. \n\nAs for the libertarian argument that it's a state infringement upon rights, I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that, and the most simply-worded right isn't always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others\u2019 rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d but I don\u2019t see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Similar to seatbelts... one person's freedom to not wear a seatbelt is offset by the rights of the taxpayer's to not have to pay for his $200,000 hospital bill.

For tobacco this is generally societally manageable and less immediately life-threatening. Nobody ever sticks anyone up for cigarette money. Same with liquor and fast food. Cocaine, meth and heroin though? People get *very* desperate over those addictions and do resort to violence if they're experiencing cravings. And the only way to stop that from happening is to prevent them from starting. Guns, last I checked, weren't addictive and that's a different debate."}, {"id": "cmdwubb", "body": "Drugs, if made widely available, can and will make your child a desperate addict.
