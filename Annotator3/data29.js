My granddad was raised in rural South Alabama - like, on a dirt road that's off of the main dirt road rural. He used the word \"nigger\" in normal speech as well. I always though he was a pretty hardcore racist when I was a kid.\n\nThen one day I was staying at my grandparents house for a few days. In the middle of lunch we got a phone call. A tree had fallen on one of their neighbor's house and fence. We (my granddad, uncle, and cousins) all left in the middle of lunch to go help remove the tree and do what we could to either make his house livable or get him somewhere to stay. We show up and the neighbor is black. We stayed there into the night fixing damage (it was a fairly small tree, and my granddad built houses for a living). It blew my mind. Later when I got up the courage to ask him why he'd helped him if he was black (I wasn't a racist, but I assumed he was), he said something to the effect of \"Skin color don't matter. You follow the golden rule whether the person is white or a nigger\".\n\nSo I learned that I was making assumptions based on my granddad's speech patterns alone. He'd grown past racism, but the speech pattern was ingrained in him. By the very strictest definition, yes, that would make him a racist.

You're right, but it's also important to realize that, due to multicultural backgrounds, (old racist/sexist people included) we're a nation of horribly conflicting ideals. And the only way to approach such topics, with any margin of a chance of influence, is diplomatically.\n\nEdit: Another thing you are missing is you presumption that everyone should be expected to live up to today's standards. The problem with that language is that not everyone thinks today's standards are more correct than the standards they learned growing up. And some people see it as foolish and gullible to change along with whatever the masses currently decide is the most up to date morality. Don't assume that when an old person says something racist/sexist they're simply being stubborn and taking advantage of the fact that they're old. In their mind they may truly see nothing wrong.

The most impressionable age to develop ones view on the world is their younger years.  Their sense of right, wrong, normal, etc. becomes established, and is the lens through which they understand their world.  As they age, they have used these biases to build further understanding, and further cementing these idea.  The longer they've had these values, the longer one would expect it to take to dislodge those ideas.\n\n2.  People don't reevaluate their values because others push them into it.  They'll simply dig in their heels.  Better to avoid addressing the topic directly, at least once your point of view is known.  They may come around.  They may not.  We're all on different places in our journeys.  Pushing the issue won't help it.  Contrary to what reddit things, berating someone for their opinions is unlikely to convince them.\n\n3.  The shift in socially appropriate values means that each generation has pushed the \"normal\" needle a bit.  A person may have started as a very open-minded, forward thinking person in their day, pushing against their own elders for their outdated values.\n\n4.  As a corollary to my third point, (and damn reddit for making me realize I'm not \"the youth\" anymore... as if my middle school daughter didn't do a good enough job of convincing me!) to the younger person, who is full of righteous energy and wants to change the world for the better, and sweep aside the unacceptable views of the past, that's great.  That's noble.  That's how social change progresses.  But remember that it's easy to see the world only from your perspective, and that you will one day be the older generation, condemned for values that you have held, and have proven true for you for your whole life.  \n\nImagine how you will feel when someone who can't remember more than two decades back, suddenly finds reason to lecture you on your views?  \n\nThink of the most extreme social view you can imagine... the one where you say, \"I'm all for A, but B is absolute nonsense.\"  30, 40, 50, 60 years later, that is now not only acceptable, but mainstream.  You have years of life experience that seem to back up your point of view; is vitriol and scorn likely to convince you?  \n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2mwhwa", "body": "In response to [this article](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/11/we-aint-taking-no-nggers-here-kentucky-fire-chief-refuses-to-help-black-family-in-traffic-accident/) a lot of people that I've talked to and many of the remarks I've seen indicate that people believe that due to the civil rights movement and other social progress taking place between the 50's and today, that it's ok, or at least more tolerable, for an 80 year old white man to spout off racist comments than it would be if he were a 30 or 40 year old man.\n\nThe same goes for sexism and other forms of discrimination that generally aren't acceptable in modern society but that we tend to give the Baby Boomers and prior generations a pass on.

What should a white male do to counter racism that Hispanics have against Blacks, and vice versa, say in the workplpace that doesn't in some way reenforce white privledge?\n\nWhen you start thinking about what these interventions entail, outside the relatively safe environment of the Internet, it all looks a lot more difficult and problematic than is suggested in your view.\n\nPersonally, I think what the world needs is more tolerance, all the way around. Rather than labelling people as racist, sexist and whatever and confronting them to conform to your ideas about the way the world should work, maybe it would be a better idea to get to know them as people and understand the reasons why they have the views they do and engage them in dialogue that hopefully leads us all into a more just world.\n\nBut, I reject the idea that there is some standard of behavior and that the world is a better place when we are confronting each other and form mobs to attack people with minority views, which is generally what this form of \"social justice\" entails.

If legal, that pretty well does apply to everyone so far as I know. If it's just a social/offensive issue, there's no real laws on tolerance that I'm aware of.\n\nYou get some young folks filled with hate of various sorts, and the main cost to them is social ostracization and general isolation to people with their similar views. It may also cost them job and romantic opportunities.\n\nMost of that stuff has already happened to old people, depending on how old we're talking. They are pretty well isolated to their peer group, their family, and then other people who usually try to make interactions as short as possible.\n\nGenerally racists get shunned more than they do called out, unless they are in a position of authority or doing it in a super public way.

And even racists are people too; if they're old, they're not doing it to be evil but because that's how they were raised.  Of course it's wrong.

Wouldn't it make more sense to just say \"we have the lowest prices in town?\" \n\nThe manager over there is a jerk? That statement could get you into a defamation lawsuit which could cripple a small company in legal fees even if they were destined to win the case. And on top of that, it's not that likely to influence opinions.\n\nTheir mattresses are less quality? Chances are half of their stock is identical unless they're all locally made at one store and if that's the case wouldn't it be better to say \"we have mattresses made by local artisans\" than \"brand such and such doesn't have locally made goods?\"\n\nAll in all it's much better to advertise positive things about your own store rather than negative things about another. \n\nPlus you always run a much higher risk of turning customers away just on principle because they don't want to support mud slingers. \n\nAnd being the first one to open up a competition of sorts runs the risk your competition may uncover dirt about you or your business that could damage you much more than if you had just never run an ad to begin with.\n\nOne of the major complaints with political mudslinging ads is they don't tell you who to vote for but why not to vote for someone else.

This is undeniable. The data shows that the surface temperate has steadily increased, so let's first establish that we can't just ignore data. Sure, the severity of global warming can be argued, but again, the first portion of my title, \"Global warming in undeniably happening\" simply means the steadily increasing temperature, and I am in no way stating specific causes of global warming. \n\nSecondly, we're going to focus on the United States. You may bring up other countries in my argument, but my argument will be based on where I reside. Again, it will be an extremely long argument if every single Country or region is involved. And my justification for leaving these areas out are because obviously areas such as Africa, for example, will generally be more negatively affected, however, they're already struggling. There's a lot of poor areas, especially also near coasts, that could potentially be screwed over. Just looking at the [opinions by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), we can quickly see that a lot of these areas care less and are unaware of the issue. Then there's the fact that the amount of effort and money it would take to really reduce global warming could easily also be invested in solving already-occurring problems and save even more lives than potentially lost from global warming. And then there's the fact that the countries that can actually cause us to lean towards one path or the other are most likely those that will not be affected extremely negatively and everyone else is expendable. In addition, since they can't do anything about it, they are just spectators. So I believe that focusing my argument on just the United States will allow for simplicity, is fairly accurate since the United States will be the main deciding factor on what will be done, and also since most redditors live in the United States it will be a more accurate argument. Feel free to also apply this argument to areas similar to the United States and do the math yourself if you're interested.\n\n\nBy 2100:\nIt's either controlled (-1 to 0 change) or there's a 5 degree celsius change (highest)\n\nHere's an interesting medium-to-worst case scenario [chart](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html) and the website also has good global warming facts leaning toward we're fucked so let's go with that for a second.\n\n**Melting Ice**\nIce will melt, sea levels will rise. Global warming could then increase, and worst-case scenario we're left with a substantial increase in water levels. People will be forced to move; I do not believe people will die since it's very gradual. Even in the worst scenario, this would just mean that those who live in more expensive areas (New York, Los Angeles) will have to move. If it's very severe I'm sure the government will handle it, however, assuming everyone is on their own, most of the coastal areas are owned and occupied by the rich, so they will be able to move easily. As for droughts, levels have been fluctuating at an inconsistent rate and even if there are droughts there always have been and they can be managed. And going back to moving: people can move to cheaper areas. It will be positive for the majority as even if it ends up being a large change in their life, it will be for the better with decreased living costs. Small added bonus: once it all melts, less ice everywhere so safer for ships.\n\n**Increasing Temperatures in General**\nDo more people die during the summer or winter in the US? The latter. Increasing winter temperatures means less pneumonia and less deaths in the winter. And at the very most temperatures will increase by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit which is manageable. And adding on to migration: there will be less rain in the south, more everywhere else. So it's all a shift toward the center. Less snow, more rain. Warmer nights. Most livestock losses will be in Texas but there's plenty of other areas higher up north that this can be shifted into. Tourism will increase and the general 'enjoyability' of the weather on average throughout the year will be higher and closer to areas often visited during vacations. Pollen is increased so it sucks for people will allergies but guess what more pollen means? \n\n**Carbon Dioxide Levels**\nThis is what is argued to cause the increased rate of global warming. What do plants like? Yep. So assuming that droughts won't be extremely severe, which even at the worst case scenario wouldn't wipe out all our crops, especially since we have irrigation, it will actually be an extremely positive effect. Especially with genetically engineered crops, I'm sure this can be taken advantage of and any possible negative effects reduced. If not, worst case scenario it'll be about the same. This will however also hurt livestock since the nutrients in plants will change, but this is assuming we haven't been basically turning livestock into genetic Frankeinsteins and also assuming natural selection doesn't occur. \n\n**Year 2100 Conclusion**\nNow of course a lot of what I said is assuming the \"worst\" or highest climate change. Odds are that it will be somewhere in the middle. Especially with us just noticing what's going on and plans to shift away and towards a more eco-friendly world, I assume global warming will be at a rate somewhere between 2-3 degrees in the next 100 years. So honestly, this will take away a lot of the super-extreme negatives and just change it enough to where the positives shine. Change isn't always bad. We can adapt, especially with the technology we have and we can use a lot of these changes to our benefit very easily. At the very worst it'll be negligible and at the best it will be beneficial. \n\n\n\n\n**Let's take a look into the future...**\nSome extreme cases say that this will occur until the year 3000. So what happens then? Well, the Antarctica ice sheets will be melting... wait, they won't be gone by the year 3000? Nope. Then there's the possibility of having another mini-ice age that will counter-act some of this. And the figure I gave you earlier? Well, actually it turns out that by the year 2100 we'll most likely have a maximum of about 4 degrees or less increase and that's on the high end of the spectrum. Then by the year 3000 we would have the 5 degree change, maybe. Now if you add in all the random fluctuations, all the possibilities for other things completely out of our control affecting global warming, everything becomes very minimal. Again, even in the worst cases most scientists agree that everything will reach an equilibrium by the year 3000. That's the year 3000... and of course until then just knowing about global warming has already caused most of the world's people want something done about it and there things being done. If you see this as a positive thing, then guess what? Global warming caused it. Now, if you see it as negative, then that means you most likely think that global warming isn't a big deal and we're just wasting effort and money, in which case that's still a positive because global warming is happening so I think we're at the perfect level of doing and/or not doing anything about it and either way we have a bright future ahead of us.\n"}, {"id": "cm80oam", "body": "Oceans won't just rise, they'll also greatly acidify as more CO2 dissolves (forming carbonic acid).

It might see a decline in usefulness as a port, if that sediment causes the Mississippi to become less navigable.\n\n&gt; But back to your poor people argument: 35% of Haiti sees it as a threat, 32% of people from Bangladesh.

If we're worried about food supply issues due to livestock shortages, shouldn't it *increase* our concern about loss of food supply from marine life?\n\n&gt;Keep in mind then, that there will also be many species that will go extinct because of the possible changes. However, it's all natural selection. If that never happened and we \"controlled\" it to never change, then a lot of important evolutionary steps wouldn't have happened and we might not even be here today. I don't think this can be seen as a negative because if anything those that survive will adapt. It's something that is inevitable in the coming centuries.\n\nThe pace of acidification is far greater than has happened in most periods in Earth's history.  The process of natural selection takes a long time to winnow out new species which are suited to the new environment.  We're talking a window here of decades, which may be only a few generations for many species of sea life.  Natural selection based on random variation takes usually at least hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands, of generations.\n\n&gt;And actually, if New Orleans was created from sediment deposits I believe, and one thing that global warming will do is crease these deposits, so if anything, New Orleans will increase in size in the long run more than without global warming.\n\nNew Orleans does not sit on the outlet of the Mississippi, and would not see an increase in land area from more sediment on the Mississippi.  Any expansion would take place on the Mississippi delta, which is to the southeast of New Orleans.  It might see a decline in usefulness as a port, if that sediment causes the Mississippi to become less navigable.\n\n&gt; But back to your poor people argument: 35% of Haiti sees it as a threat, 32% of people from Bangladesh. Even if they had the funding and power to, these people are obviously not concerned about global warming.\n\nI don't see how popular opinion polls reflect the risk of flooding.  Most people aren't climate scientists and don't know what the increased risk of flooding would be.

I'm sure oil companies will be able to come up with a solution. Why are we even bringing oil companies into this? Are we supposed to be sympathetic that they possibly will have issues after global warming? Guess what? Good. If you truly believe global warming is bad, then you should be happy about oil companies having problems. Because then maybe oil will die out sooner and we'll have less global warming. This is the most compelling argument you've made yet it's for the wrong side and a useless argument no matter what side you're on."}, {"id": "cm89xyq", "body": "&gt;The infrastructure can easily be replaced \n\nThere are millions and millions of people who depend on the ocean.

Keep in mind then, that there will also be many species that will go extinct because of the possible changes. However, it's all natural selection. If that never happened and we \"controlled\" it to never change, then a lot of important evolutionary steps wouldn't have happened and we might not even be here today. I don't think this can be seen as a negative because if anything those that survive will adapt. It's something that is inevitable in the coming centuries. \n\nAs for your second argument, it's around the world. I did already state that. And actually, if New Orleans was created from sediment deposits I believe, and one thing that global warming will do is crease these deposits, so if anything, New Orleans will increase in size in the long run more than without global warming. But back to your poor people argument: 35% of Haiti sees it as a threat, 32% of people from Bangladesh. Even if they had the funding and power to, these people are obviously not concerned about global warming. I assume it's the same for West Africa but I don't have data at hand. However, as I stated, they don't even have this power, but the people who do have the power have higher concerns so I'm sure these countries are still better off with the aid they receive from larger countries, even if these countries contribute to global warming which may cause some flooding of the areas. And again, this would be very gradual, so there's no way someone can physically die from it unless it's directly due to an actual flood or tsunami that can already happen."}, {"id": "cm895vi", "body": "Are you actually suggesting that global warming will increase the size of New Orleans from sedimentation faster than a rise in sea level would shrink it?"}, {"id": "2mvrlv", "body": "The first part of my view is quite simple: global warming is obviously occurring. This is undeniable. The data shows that the surface temperate has steadily increased, so let's first establish that we can't just ignore data. Sure, the severity of global warming can be argued, but again, the first portion of my title, \"Global warming in undeniably happening\" simply means the steadily increasing temperature, and I am in no way stating specific causes of global warming. \n\nSecondly, we're going to focus on the United States. You may bring up other countries in my argument, but my argument will be based on where I reside. Again, it will be an extremely long argument if every single Country or region is involved. And my justification for leaving these areas out are because obviously areas such as Africa, for example, will generally be more negatively affected, however, they're already struggling. There's a lot of poor areas, especially also near coasts, that could potentially be screwed over. Just looking at the [opinions by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), we can quickly see that a lot of these areas care less and are unaware of the issue. Then there's the fact that the amount of effort and money it would take to really reduce global warming could easily also be invested in solving already-occurring problems and save even more lives than potentially lost from global warming. And then there's the fact that the countries that can actually cause us to lean towards one path or the other are most likely those that will not be affected extremely negatively and everyone else is expendable. In addition, since they can't do anything about it, they are just spectators. So I believe that focusing my argument on just the United States will allow for simplicity, is fairly accurate since the United States will be the main deciding factor on what will be done, and also since most redditors live in the United States it will be a more accurate argument. Feel free to also apply this argument to areas similar to the United States and do the math yourself if you're interested.\n\n\nBy 2100:\nIt's either controlled (-1 to 0 change) or there's a 5 degree celsius change (highest)\n\nHere's an interesting medium-to-worst case scenario [chart](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html) and the website also has good global warming facts leaning toward we're fucked so let's go with that for a second.\n\n**Melting Ice**\nIce will melt, sea levels will rise. Global warming could then increase, and worst-case scenario we're left with a substantial increase in water levels. People will be forced to move; I do not believe people will die since it's very gradual. Even in the worst scenario, this would just mean that those who live in more expensive areas (New York, Los Angeles) will have to move. If it's very severe I'm sure the government will handle it, however, assuming everyone is on their own, most of the coastal areas are owned and occupied by the rich, so they will be able to move easily. As for droughts, levels have been fluctuating at an inconsistent rate and even if there are droughts there always have been and they can be managed. And going back to moving: people can move to cheaper areas. It will be positive for the majority as even if it ends up being a large change in their life, it will be for the better with decreased living costs. Small added bonus: once it all melts, less ice everywhere so safer for ships.\n\n**Increasing Temperatures in General**\nDo more people die during the summer or winter in the US? The latter. Increasing winter temperatures means less pneumonia and less deaths in the winter. And at the very most temperatures will increase by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit which is manageable. And adding on to migration: there will be less rain in the south, more everywhere else. So it's all a shift toward the center. Less snow, more rain. Warmer nights. Most livestock losses will be in Texas but there's plenty of other areas higher up north that this can be shifted into. Tourism will increase and the general 'enjoyability' of the weather on average throughout the year will be higher and closer to areas often visited during vacations. Pollen is increased so it sucks for people will allergies but guess what more pollen means? \n\n**Carbon Dioxide Levels**\nThis is what is argued to cause the increased rate of global warming. What do plants like? Yep. So assuming that droughts won't be extremely severe, which even at the worst case scenario wouldn't wipe out all our crops, especially since we have irrigation, it will actually be an extremely positive effect. Especially with genetically engineered crops, I'm sure this can be taken advantage of and any possible negative effects reduced. If not, worst case scenario it'll be about the same. This will however also hurt livestock since the nutrients in plants will change, but this is assuming we haven't been basically turning livestock into genetic Frankeinsteins and also assuming natural selection doesn't occur. \n\n**Year 2100 Conclusion**\nNow of course a lot of what I said is assuming the \"worst\" or highest climate change. Odds are that it will be somewhere in the middle. Especially with us just noticing what's going on and plans to shift away and towards a more eco-friendly world, I assume global warming will be at a rate somewhere between 2-3 degrees in the next 100 years. So honestly, this will take away a lot of the super-extreme negatives and just change it enough to where the positives shine. Change isn't always bad. We can adapt, especially with the technology we have and we can use a lot of these changes to our benefit very easily. At the very worst it'll be negligible and at the best it will be beneficial. \n\n\n\n\n**Let's take a look into the future...**\nSome extreme cases say that this will occur until the year 3000. So what happens then? Well, the Antarctica ice sheets will be melting... wait, they won't be gone by the year 3000? Nope. Then there's the possibility of having another mini-ice age that will counter-act some of this. And the figure I gave you earlier? Well, actually it turns out that by the year 2100 we'll most likely have a maximum of about 4 degrees or less increase and that's on the high end of the spectrum. Then by the year 3000 we would have the 5 degree change, maybe. Now if you add in all the random fluctuations, all the possibilities for other things completely out of our control affecting global warming, everything becomes very minimal. Again, even in the worst cases most scientists agree that everything will reach an equilibrium by the year 3000. That's the year 3000... and of course until then just knowing about global warming has already caused most of the world's people want something done about it and there things being done. If you see this as a positive thing, then guess what? Global warming caused it. Now, if you see it as negative, then that means you most likely think that global warming isn't a big deal and we're just wasting effort and money, in which case that's still a positive because global warming is happening so I think we're at the perfect level of doing and/or not doing anything about it and either way we have a bright future ahead of us.\n"}, {"id": "cm81cbl", "body": "This is wrong.

The only argument against plants really is that the water will be \"lower quality\" or that they'll need more water, and other arguments around water such as possibly a higher chance of drought but this again is stuff we know how to deal with for the most part.\n\nAnd you can't just say it will happen 2-3 degrees Celsius per century. That's not how science works. Even the people who say we're fucked don't say something stupid like this because they know it'll taper off. "}, {"id": "cm8b9ah", "body": "&gt; Guess what?

You may bring up other countries in my argument, but my argument will be based on where I reside. Again, it will be an extremely long argument if every single Country or region is involved.

There's a lot of poor areas, especially also near coasts, that could potentially be screwed over. Just looking at the [opinions by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), we can quickly see that a lot of these areas care less and are unaware of the issue. Then there's the fact that the amount of effort and money it would take to really reduce global warming could easily also be invested in solving already-occurring problems and save even more lives than potentially lost from global warming. And then there's the fact that the countries that can actually cause us to lean towards one path or the other are most likely those that will not be affected extremely negatively and everyone else is expendable.

Feel free to also apply this argument to areas similar to the United States and do the math yourself if you're interested.\n\n\nBy 2100:\nIt's either controlled (-1 to 0 change) or there's a 5 degree celsius change (highest)\n\nHere's an interesting medium-to-worst case scenario [chart](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html) and the website also has good global warming facts leaning toward we're fucked so let's go with that for a second.\n\n**Melting Ice**\nIce will melt, sea levels will rise. Global warming could then increase, and worst-case scenario we're left with a substantial increase in water levels. People will be forced to move; I do not believe people will die since it's very gradual. Even in the worst scenario, this would just mean that those who live in more expensive areas (New York, Los Angeles) will have to move. If it's very severe I'm sure the government will handle it, however, assuming everyone is on their own, most of the coastal areas are owned and occupied by the rich, so they will be able to move easily. As for droughts, levels have been fluctuating at an inconsistent rate and even if there are droughts there always have been and they can be managed. And going back to moving: people can move to cheaper areas. It will be positive for the majority as even if it ends up being a large change in their life, it will be for the better with decreased living costs. Small added bonus: once it all melts, less ice everywhere so safer for ships.\n\n**Increasing Temperatures in General**\nDo more people die during the summer or winter in the US? The latter. Increasing winter temperatures means less pneumonia and less deaths in the winter. And at the very most temperatures will increase by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit which is manageable. And adding on to migration: there will be less rain in the south, more everywhere else. So it's all a shift toward the center. Less snow, more rain. Warmer nights. Most livestock losses will be in Texas but there's plenty of other areas higher up north that this can be shifted into. Tourism will increase and the general 'enjoyability' of the weather on average throughout the year will be higher and closer to areas often visited during vacations. Pollen is increased so it sucks for people will allergies but guess what more pollen means? \n\n**Carbon Dioxide Levels**\nThis is what is argued to cause the increased rate of global warming. What do plants like? Yep. So assuming that droughts won't be extremely severe, which even at the worst case scenario wouldn't wipe out all our crops, especially since we have irrigation, it will actually be an extremely positive effect. Especially with genetically engineered crops, I'm sure this can be taken advantage of and any possible negative effects reduced. If not, worst case scenario it'll be about the same. This will however also hurt livestock since the nutrients in plants will change, but this is assuming we haven't been basically turning livestock into genetic Frankeinsteins and also assuming natural selection doesn't occur. \n\n**Year 2100 Conclusion**\nNow of course a lot of what I said is assuming the \"worst\" or highest climate change. Odds are that it will be somewhere in the middle. Especially with us just noticing what's going on and plans to shift away and towards a more eco-friendly world, I assume global warming will be at a rate somewhere between 2-3 degrees in the next 100 years. So honestly, this will take away a lot of the super-extreme negatives and just change it enough to where the positives shine. Change isn't always bad. We can adapt, especially with the technology we have and we can use a lot of these changes to our benefit very easily. At the very worst it'll be negligible and at the best it will be beneficial. \n\n\n\n\n**Let's take a look into the future...**\nSome extreme cases say that this will occur until the year 3000. So what happens then? Well, the Antarctica ice sheets will be melting... wait, they won't be gone by the year 3000? Nope. Then there's the possibility of having another mini-ice age that will counter-act some of this. And the figure I gave you earlier? Well, actually it turns out that by the year 2100 we'll most likely have a maximum of about 4 degrees or less increase and that's on the high end of the spectrum. Then by the year 3000 we would have the 5 degree change, maybe. Now if you add in all the random fluctuations, all the possibilities for other things completely out of our control affecting global warming, everything becomes very minimal. Again, even in the worst cases most scientists agree that everything will reach an equilibrium by the year 3000. That's the year 3000... and of course until then just knowing about global warming has already caused most of the world's people want something done about it and there things being done. If you see this as a positive thing, then guess what? Global warming caused it. Now, if you see it as negative, then that means you most likely think that global warming isn't a big deal and we're just wasting effort and money, in which case that's still a positive because global warming is happening so I think we're at the perfect level of doing and/or not doing anything about it and either way we have a bright future ahead of us.\n"}, {"id": "cm80z2m", "body": "rising sea levels are incredibly dangerous, and for most country's moving further inland is not a viable strategy,\n\nglobal warming will increase at a faster pace as ice melts, so the timetable until its a danger is a lot sooner than you think\n\nglobal warming isn't just warming, its also more dangerous weather patterns\n\nplants don't consume infinite co2, adding more does not help crop yield\n\ndon't underestimate 1-2 degrees, its enough to wipe out entire animal species \n\n"}, {"id": "cm80z2m", "body": "rising sea levels are incredibly dangerous, and for most country's moving further inland is not a viable strategy,\n\nglobal warming will increase at a faster pace as ice melts, so the timetable until its a danger is a lot sooner than you think\n\nglobal warming isn't just warming, its also more dangerous weather patterns\n\nplants don't consume infinite co2, adding more does not help crop yield\n\ndon't underestimate 1-2 degrees, its enough to wipe out entire animal species \n\n"}, {"id": "cm84bes", "body": "Dangerous weather patterns are more or less myths at the moment.

In Los Angeles, a city with millions of people, there's, I believe, one Walmart within the city. In my city of 50,000 inhabitants, there are two Walmarts. In the city next to us with probably another 50,000 people, there's another two. But again, you're turning this into a business argument. We should return to the main point. If you want to argue business, we can argue business and I'm sure I know my business more than I know global warming so you can't get away with making up facts there either."}, {"id": "cm8dsf5", "body": "&gt;You just stated everywhere else in the world will bring more tourists.\n\nNo, I implied everywhere else will have higher temperatures. Get your facts straight before you start building straw men. You also clearly missed my point. Global warming will not give anyone any reason to visit the US over any other country. It's a global phenomenon and will affect globally. There is no net benefit.\n\n&gt;And most tourists do not go to NY, LA, or SF. You're saying most, or 51% or more tourists go to 3 cities out of the entire US. That's incorrect. What about Chicago? Washington D.C? Boston? And everywhere else? Right, you left those out.\n\nAgain, if you read correctly, you would notice I said \"big cities like...\" Nowhere did I say  6 of the 10 biggest cities in the US are near the coast. \n\n&gt;But again, you're turning this into a business argument. We should return to the main point.\n\nBecause businesses will be negatively impacted by global warming. And you failed to argue how the US will benefit from property value losses in its largest cities. Businesses, rich people, middle class, and poor people will all lose (for many the largest portion of net worth) much of their wealth while enduring the costs of relocation and having no capital gains to offset. These are clearly negative effects."}, {"id": "2mvrlv", "body": "The first part of my view is quite simple: global warming is obviously occurring. This is undeniable. The data shows that the surface temperate has steadily increased, so let's first establish that we can't just ignore data. Sure, the severity of global warming can be argued, but again, the first portion of my title, \"Global warming in undeniably happening\" simply means the steadily increasing temperature, and I am in no way stating specific causes of global warming. \n\nSecondly, we're going to focus on the United States. You may bring up other countries in my argument, but my argument will be based on where I reside. Again, it will be an extremely long argument if every single Country or region is involved. And my justification for leaving these areas out are because obviously areas such as Africa, for example, will generally be more negatively affected, however, they're already struggling. There's a lot of poor areas, especially also near coasts, that could potentially be screwed over. Just looking at the [opinions by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), we can quickly see that a lot of these areas care less and are unaware of the issue. Then there's the fact that the amount of effort and money it would take to really reduce global warming could easily also be invested in solving already-occurring problems and save even more lives than potentially lost from global warming. And then there's the fact that the countries that can actually cause us to lean towards one path or the other are most likely those that will not be affected extremely negatively and everyone else is expendable. In addition, since they can't do anything about it, they are just spectators. So I believe that focusing my argument on just the United States will allow for simplicity, is fairly accurate since the United States will be the main deciding factor on what will be done, and also since most redditors live in the United States it will be a more accurate argument. Feel free to also apply this argument to areas similar to the United States and do the math yourself if you're interested.\n\n\nBy 2100:\nIt's either controlled (-1 to 0 change) or there's a 5 degree celsius change (highest)\n\nHere's an interesting medium-to-worst case scenario [chart](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html) and the website also has good global warming facts leaning toward we're fucked so let's go with that for a second.\n\n**Melting Ice**\nIce will melt, sea levels will rise. Global warming could then increase, and worst-case scenario we're left with a substantial increase in water levels. People will be forced to move; I do not believe people will die since it's very gradual. Even in the worst scenario, this would just mean that those who live in more expensive areas (New York, Los Angeles) will have to move. If it's very severe I'm sure the government will handle it, however, assuming everyone is on their own, most of the coastal areas are owned and occupied by the rich, so they will be able to move easily. As for droughts, levels have been fluctuating at an inconsistent rate and even if there are droughts there always have been and they can be managed. And going back to moving: people can move to cheaper areas. It will be positive for the majority as even if it ends up being a large change in their life, it will be for the better with decreased living costs. Small added bonus: once it all melts, less ice everywhere so safer for ships.\n\n**Increasing Temperatures in General**\nDo more people die during the summer or winter in the US? The latter. Increasing winter temperatures means less pneumonia and less deaths in the winter. And at the very most temperatures will increase by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit which is manageable. And adding on to migration: there will be less rain in the south, more everywhere else. So it's all a shift toward the center. Less snow, more rain. Warmer nights. Most livestock losses will be in Texas but there's plenty of other areas higher up north that this can be shifted into. Tourism will increase and the general 'enjoyability' of the weather on average throughout the year will be higher and closer to areas often visited during vacations. Pollen is increased so it sucks for people will allergies but guess what more pollen means? \n\n**Carbon Dioxide Levels**\nThis is what is argued to cause the increased rate of global warming. What do plants like? Yep. So assuming that droughts won't be extremely severe, which even at the worst case scenario wouldn't wipe out all our crops, especially since we have irrigation, it will actually be an extremely positive effect. Especially with genetically engineered crops, I'm sure this can be taken advantage of and any possible negative effects reduced. If not, worst case scenario it'll be about the same. This will however also hurt livestock since the nutrients in plants will change, but this is assuming we haven't been basically turning livestock into genetic Frankeinsteins and also assuming natural selection doesn't occur. \n\n**Year 2100 Conclusion**\nNow of course a lot of what I said is assuming the \"worst\" or highest climate change. Odds are that it will be somewhere in the middle. Especially with us just noticing what's going on and plans to shift away and towards a more eco-friendly world, I assume global warming will be at a rate somewhere between 2-3 degrees in the next 100 years. So honestly, this will take away a lot of the super-extreme negatives and just change it enough to where the positives shine. Change isn't always bad. We can adapt, especially with the technology we have and we can use a lot of these changes to our benefit very easily. At the very worst it'll be negligible and at the best it will be beneficial. \n\n\n\n\n**Let's take a look into the future...**\nSome extreme cases say that this will occur until the year 3000. So what happens then? Well, the Antarctica ice sheets will be melting... wait, they won't be gone by the year 3000? Nope. Then there's the possibility of having another mini-ice age that will counter-act some of this. And the figure I gave you earlier? Well, actually it turns out that by the year 2100 we'll most likely have a maximum of about 4 degrees or less increase and that's on the high end of the spectrum. Then by the year 3000 we would have the 5 degree change, maybe. Now if you add in all the random fluctuations, all the possibilities for other things completely out of our control affecting global warming, everything becomes very minimal. Again, even in the worst cases most scientists agree that everything will reach an equilibrium by the year 3000. That's the year 3000... and of course until then just knowing about global warming has already caused most of the world's people want something done about it and there things being done. If you see this as a positive thing, then guess what? Global warming caused it. Now, if you see it as negative, then that means you most likely think that global warming isn't a big deal and we're just wasting effort and money, in which case that's still a positive because global warming is happening so I think we're at the perfect level of doing and/or not doing anything about it and either way we have a bright future ahead of us.\n"}, {"id": "cm850mf", "body": "The phrase 'knowing just enough to be dangerous' comes to mind.\n\n&gt;What do plants like?

You may bring up other countries in my argument, but my argument will be based on where I reside. Again, it will be an extremely long argument if every single Country or region is involved. And my justification for leaving these areas out are because obviously areas such as Africa, for example, will generally be more negatively affected, however, they're already struggling. There's a lot of poor areas, especially also near coasts, that could potentially be screwed over. Just looking at the [opinions by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), we can quickly see that a lot of these areas care less and are unaware of the issue. Then there's the fact that the amount of effort and money it would take to really reduce global warming could easily also be invested in solving already-occurring problems and save even more lives than potentially lost from global warming. And then there's the fact that the countries that can actually cause us to lean towards one path or the other are most likely those that will not be affected extremely negatively and everyone else is expendable. In addition, since they can't do anything about it, they are just spectators. So I believe that focusing my argument on just the United States will allow for simplicity, is fairly accurate since the United States will be the main deciding factor on what will be done, and also since most redditors live in the United States it will be a more accurate argument. Feel free to also apply this argument to areas similar to the United States and do the math yourself if you're interested.\n\n\nBy 2100:\nIt's either controlled (-1 to 0 change) or there's a 5 degree celsius change (highest)\n\nHere's an interesting medium-to-worst case scenario [chart](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html) and the website also has good global warming facts leaning toward we're fucked so let's go with that for a second.\n\n**Melting Ice**\nIce will melt, sea levels will rise. Global warming could then increase, and worst-case scenario we're left with a substantial increase in water levels. People will be forced to move; I do not believe people will die since it's very gradual. Even in the worst scenario, this would just mean that those who live in more expensive areas (New York, Los Angeles) will have to move. If it's very severe I'm sure the government will handle it, however, assuming everyone is on their own, most of the coastal areas are owned and occupied by the rich, so they will be able to move easily. As for droughts, levels have been fluctuating at an inconsistent rate and even if there are droughts there always have been and they can be managed. And going back to moving: people can move to cheaper areas. It will be positive for the majority as even if it ends up being a large change in their life, it will be for the better with decreased living costs. Small added bonus: once it all melts, less ice everywhere so safer for ships.\n\n**Increasing Temperatures in General**\nDo more people die during the summer or winter in the US? The latter. Increasing winter temperatures means less pneumonia and less deaths in the winter. And at the very most temperatures will increase by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit which is manageable. And adding on to migration: there will be less rain in the south, more everywhere else. So it's all a shift toward the center. Less snow, more rain. Warmer nights. Most livestock losses will be in Texas but there's plenty of other areas higher up north that this can be shifted into. Tourism will increase and the general 'enjoyability' of the weather on average throughout the year will be higher and closer to areas often visited during vacations. Pollen is increased so it sucks for people will allergies but guess what more pollen means? \n\n**Carbon Dioxide Levels**\nThis is what is argued to cause the increased rate of global warming. What do plants like? Yep. So assuming that droughts won't be extremely severe, which even at the worst case scenario wouldn't wipe out all our crops, especially since we have irrigation, it will actually be an extremely positive effect. Especially with genetically engineered crops, I'm sure this can be taken advantage of and any possible negative effects reduced. If not, worst case scenario it'll be about the same. This will however also hurt livestock since the nutrients in plants will change, but this is assuming we haven't been basically turning livestock into genetic Frankeinsteins and also assuming natural selection doesn't occur. \n\n**Year 2100 Conclusion**\nNow of course a lot of what I said is assuming the \"worst\" or highest climate change. Odds are that it will be somewhere in the middle. Especially with us just noticing what's going on and plans to shift away and towards a more eco-friendly world, I assume global warming will be at a rate somewhere between 2-3 degrees in the next 100 years. So honestly, this will take away a lot of the super-extreme negatives and just change it enough to where the positives shine. Change isn't always bad. We can adapt, especially with the technology we have and we can use a lot of these changes to our benefit very easily. At the very worst it'll be negligible and at the best it will be beneficial. \n\n\n\n\n**Let's take a look into the future...**\nSome extreme cases say that this will occur until the year 3000. So what happens then? Well, the Antarctica ice sheets will be melting... wait, they won't be gone by the year 3000? Nope. Then there's the possibility of having another mini-ice age that will counter-act some of this. And the figure I gave you earlier? Well, actually it turns out that by the year 2100 we'll most likely have a maximum of about 4 degrees or less increase and that's on the high end of the spectrum. Then by the year 3000 we would have the 5 degree change, maybe. Now if you add in all the random fluctuations, all the possibilities for other things completely out of our control affecting global warming, everything becomes very minimal. Again, even in the worst cases most scientists agree that everything will reach an equilibrium by the year 3000. That's the year 3000... and of course until then just knowing about global warming has already caused most of the world's people want something done about it and there things being done. If you see this as a positive thing, then guess what? Global warming caused it. Now, if you see it as negative, then that means you most likely think that global warming isn't a big deal and we're just wasting effort and money, in which case that's still a positive because global warming is happening so I think we're at the perfect level of doing and/or not doing anything about it and either way we have a bright future ahead of us.\n"}, {"id": "cm86301", "body": "&gt;  Ice will melt, sea levels will rise.

And then go look at where, for example, we raise most of our cattle. It has nothing to do with the areas that are getting flooded.\n\nI do have a source for everything. I'm not ignoring heat strokes. I specifically agreed with you that more people would die from heatstrokes, but less people would die in the winter. And with all the vague statistics and different opinions, I think it's fairly safe to say that it will at least balance out. Wildfires do kill a lot of people, but mostly in other parts of the world where there's immensely higher death rates from disease and other issues. I'm quite sure I did link at least one source that stated the winter benefits, but you can just look at the government report on it or use Google.\n\nAssuming that droughts won't be extremely severe isn't a huge assumption. Assuming that droughts will be extremely severe is. Are you saying that there will be extremely severe droughts? Because that's \"quite the assumption\" when even the harshest assessments of global warming are usually very vague and inconclusive about droughts in terms of it being \"extremely severe.\" Global warming is about it being warmer AND about it destabilizing the weather AND causing changes to the planet, but I wouldn't say they're very drastic. I guess it depends on how you define these words. \n\n\nLet's look at the definitions.\n\nDrastic\nlikely to have a strong or far-reaching effect; radical and extreme.\n\"a drastic reduction of staffing levels\"\n\nSevere\n(of something bad or undesirable) very great; intense.\n\"a severe shortage of technicians\"\n\nExtremely\nto a very great degree; very.\n\"this is an extremely difficult thing to do\"\n\n\n\nNow let's look at what we're looking at: a 5 degree Celsius maximum change over 1000 years. Average 0.005 Celsius per year. Or if you want to look at it on a shorter scale, maybe 4 degrees maximum through 100 years, or 0.04 degrees Celsius per year. This is nothing near extreme, drastic, severe, or whatever you want to call it. Carbon levels? Maybe, since it can be 2x or 3x, but if we're talking about the effects, they will be noticeable but not severe.

You assume in every one of your points that some entity will just magically \"take care of it\". \n\n\n\nScientists and engineers much more knowledgeable on the subject of Global Warming are raising the alarm bells. From the IPCC,\n\n&gt;Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.\n\n\nPeople more knowledgeable than you have already performed the analysis. You know, people with actual experience in economics and climate modeling. And I'm not surprised that you're an engineer. Many people in our field have terrible habit of extrapolating out of their knowledge domain into things they do not understand. The difference between you and me is that I'm not arrogant enough to assume I know better than the climate modelers or physicists working in the next department over. \n\n\n&gt;However, assuming the worst doesn't mean I will assume that, for example, the Earth will explode. It has to be plausible.\n\nAnd you don't think the dangers of Climate Change are \"plausible\"??\n\nTake for example my job - analyzing structures for ocean oil rigs. Yes, it's obviously stupid to assume an enormous 200-ft wave will constantly hit the rig. 200-ft waves won't happen. Instead, we assume 1-Year hurricane or 100-Year hurricane events. These events are statements of probability analysis that assume the worst 3 hour event that will happen in 1 or 100 years. The same analysis can be done for climate change - you can take the worst 10% of predicted scenarios via modeling and design around those. \n\n"}, {"id": "cm87ne2", "body": "I'm studying engineering, how'd you know?\n\nMy class today actually focused on Murphy's law.

The data shows that the surface temperate has steadily increased, so let's first establish that we can't just ignore data. Sure, the severity of global warming can be argued, but again, the first portion of my title, \"Global warming in undeniably happening\" simply means the steadily increasing temperature, and I am in no way stating specific causes of global warming. \n\nSecondly, we're going to focus on the United States. You may bring up other countries in my argument, but my argument will be based on where I reside. Again, it will be an extremely long argument if every single Country or region is involved. And my justification for leaving these areas out are because obviously areas such as Africa, for example, will generally be more negatively affected, however, they're already struggling. There's a lot of poor areas, especially also near coasts, that could potentially be screwed over. Just looking at the [opinions by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), we can quickly see that a lot of these areas care less and are unaware of the issue. Then there's the fact that the amount of effort and money it would take to really reduce global warming could easily also be invested in solving already-occurring problems and save even more lives than potentially lost from global warming. And then there's the fact that the countries that can actually cause us to lean towards one path or the other are most likely those that will not be affected extremely negatively and everyone else is expendable. In addition, since they can't do anything about it, they are just spectators. So I believe that focusing my argument on just the United States will allow for simplicity, is fairly accurate since the United States will be the main deciding factor on what will be done, and also since most redditors live in the United States it will be a more accurate argument. Feel free to also apply this argument to areas similar to the United States and do the math yourself if you're interested.\n\n\nBy 2100:\nIt's either controlled (-1 to 0 change) or there's a 5 degree celsius change (highest)\n\nHere's an interesting medium-to-worst case scenario [chart](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html) and the website also has good global warming facts leaning toward we're fucked so let's go with that for a second.\n\n**Melting Ice**\nIce will melt, sea levels will rise. Global warming could then increase, and worst-case scenario we're left with a substantial increase in water levels. People will be forced to move; I do not believe people will die since it's very gradual. Even in the worst scenario, this would just mean that those who live in more expensive areas (New York, Los Angeles) will have to move. If it's very severe I'm sure the government will handle it, however, assuming everyone is on their own, most of the coastal areas are owned and occupied by the rich, so they will be able to move easily. As for droughts, levels have been fluctuating at an inconsistent rate and even if there are droughts there always have been and they can be managed. And going back to moving: people can move to cheaper areas. It will be positive for the majority as even if it ends up being a large change in their life, it will be for the better with decreased living costs. Small added bonus: once it all melts, less ice everywhere so safer for ships.\n\n**Increasing Temperatures in General**\nDo more people die during the summer or winter in the US? The latter. Increasing winter temperatures means less pneumonia and less deaths in the winter. And at the very most temperatures will increase by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit which is manageable. And adding on to migration: there will be less rain in the south, more everywhere else. So it's all a shift toward the center. Less snow, more rain. Warmer nights. Most livestock losses will be in Texas but there's plenty of other areas higher up north that this can be shifted into. Tourism will increase and the general 'enjoyability' of the weather on average throughout the year will be higher and closer to areas often visited during vacations. Pollen is increased so it sucks for people will allergies but guess what more pollen means? \n\n**Carbon Dioxide Levels**\nThis is what is argued to cause the increased rate of global warming. What do plants like? Yep. So assuming that droughts won't be extremely severe, which even at the worst case scenario wouldn't wipe out all our crops, especially since we have irrigation, it will actually be an extremely positive effect. Especially with genetically engineered crops, I'm sure this can be taken advantage of and any possible negative effects reduced. If not, worst case scenario it'll be about the same. This will however also hurt livestock since the nutrients in plants will change, but this is assuming we haven't been basically turning livestock into genetic Frankeinsteins and also assuming natural selection doesn't occur. \n\n**Year 2100 Conclusion**\nNow of course a lot of what I said is assuming the \"worst\" or highest climate change. Odds are that it will be somewhere in the middle. Especially with us just noticing what's going on and plans to shift away and towards a more eco-friendly world, I assume global warming will be at a rate somewhere between 2-3 degrees in the next 100 years. So honestly, this will take away a lot of the super-extreme negatives and just change it enough to where the positives shine. Change isn't always bad. We can adapt, especially with the technology we have and we can use a lot of these changes to our benefit very easily. At the very worst it'll be negligible and at the best it will be beneficial. \n\n\n\n\n**Let's take a look into the future...**\nSome extreme cases say that this will occur until the year 3000. So what happens then? Well, the Antarctica ice sheets will be melting... wait, they won't be gone by the year 3000? Nope. Then there's the possibility of having another mini-ice age that will counter-act some of this. And the figure I gave you earlier? Well, actually it turns out that by the year 2100 we'll most likely have a maximum of about 4 degrees or less increase and that's on the high end of the spectrum. Then by the year 3000 we would have the 5 degree change, maybe. Now if you add in all the random fluctuations, all the possibilities for other things completely out of our control affecting global warming, everything becomes very minimal. Again, even in the worst cases most scientists agree that everything will reach an equilibrium by the year 3000. That's the year 3000... and of course until then just knowing about global warming has already caused most of the world's people want something done about it and there things being done. If you see this as a positive thing, then guess what? Global warming caused it. Now, if you see it as negative, then that means you most likely think that global warming isn't a big deal and we're just wasting effort and money, in which case that's still a positive because global warming is happening so I think we're at the perfect level of doing and/or not doing anything about it and either way we have a bright future ahead of us.\n"}, {"id": "cm87sue", "body": "You're wrong in thinking that damage caused by sea-level rise will be gradual and non-fatal.

Now note specifically I am talking about the non-violent kind of rape where neither member is injured physically, but express verbal consent still wasn't given or statutory rape where one member is too young to give consent.\n\nIt seems to me that in today's society, men are expected to want sex all the time. It's most obvious in cases where female teachers have sex with younger boys and peoples reaction to it (mostly) is 'NOICCE' or 'I wish this happened to me, my teacher was hot'. Then when it happens with the sexes reversed the reaction is mostly, 'That disgusting pedo deserves to get anally raped in jail' and 'Oh that poor girl, a terrible thing has been done to her'.\n\nAs a result of this, you come across a lot of men who have been technically raped but who simply get over it extremely quickly despite feeling dirty, violated etc as other guys around them just say stuff like 'You got laid dude quit complaining'. Essentially, society acts to minimise those bad feelings, allowing the man to move on quickly.\n\nHowever, when a woman gets raped, society's reaction amplifies these bad feelings to make the woman feel even worse. Society makes women feel they are now damaged, and a mark has been burned on them forever. This kind of thing is obvious in cases where a woman who initially thought a sexual encounter was just uncomfortable is now told she was raped. Society's general reaction to rape would only make the woman feel even worse about it, and not let her move on for a much longer time than for a man.\n\nI am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong, but it seems to be that way. So CMV, does society make female rape victims feel worse about it then they would otherwise?\n\n\n\n_____\n\n"}, {"id": "cm7vgm1", "body": "I have two links for you: [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikd0ZYQoDko) and [that one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jwuuw/serious_male_victims_of_sexual_assault_harassment/).

This is especially true for men... if you talk about rape as a guy, you'll quickly be shot down for \"derailing\" or \"mansplaining\" or a variety of other terms.  However, if you say you're rape victim, then they'll listen to you.  The result of this is you're forced to recount some serious trauma and be seen as a victim (with all the dangerous consequences thereof) if you want to talk about rape  in general... which sucks.\n\nThat's the only place I've felt society was giving too much attention and trying to bring back the trauma a lot.

I think what causes the most trauma is the feeling lots of rape victims have that it's somehow \"their fault\" or that \"they're responsible\".\n\nTo some extent it is society's fault for saying things like \"You shouldn't have drunk to much\" or \"You shouldn't have dressed slutty\" or \"You're a man,  you should like it\". With that said, I believe that the people who hold those views and say those things are in the minority. The issue is, when something traumatizing happens, it puts you in a dark place. You hear 10 people say \"it's not your fault\" and 1 person say \"Why did you put yourself in that situation\" and you latch on to that 1 persons statement.\n\nIt's also natural for humans to try to find a reason for events that may not have a reason. Something unexplainable happens and we try to find out why. The truth is with rape, the reason why is the rapist is a horrible person but that doesn't do well to satisfy the question of why so people find other reasons. It's one of the reasons people turn to religion in times of tragedy. A horrible event occurs and it's easier to understand if you can come up with a reason such as \"it was gods will\" or \"it's all part of gods plan\". The difference being with religion is it has a positive spin with the \"their in a better place now\" whereas with the internal justifications of rape there is no positive spin. I was reluctant to bring up the topic of religion as I don't want this to turn into a debate on religion at all. I'm happy to talk about why I feel they're similar but would prefer to not go on about if there is a god or not or if religion is positive or not.\n\n"}, {"id": "cm7vgm1", "body": "I have two links for you: [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikd0ZYQoDko) and [that one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jwuuw/serious_male_victims_of_sexual_assault_harassment/).

When a man gets raped by a woman, to society he is seen as having acquired sex with a woman. He is a 'Manly man', he is given a high five and pat on the back and told to go on to the next one, his feelings about it be damned. If he expresses his trauma about it he is shamed, and his feelings denied as valid.\n\nA Woman in today's society is not expected to want sex all the time at all, and rather is seen as 'chaste'. If a woman is raped by a man, she is seen to lose this chastity. She is suddenly not Womanly anymore and is treated by society as though she is somehow inferior because of the rape.\n\nEssentially the man raped by a woman is treated positively and more Manly about the rape despite his own degree of trauma (high or low), while the woman is treated negatively and as less Womanly about it despite her degree of trauma (high or low). \n\nWould you say that it is better to be treated positively despite the horrible effects of minimization than to be treated negatively universally? \n\nI hope I don't come across like a complete dick about this, I've never really known much about rape and its effects and I wanted some discussion to shed light on it.

I know that I was very, very young. \n\nWeirdly, I draw blanks about certain things. I don\u2019t remember their faces. I don\u2019t remember any words being said to me. It\u2019s as if I know what happened now, but for a long time I didn't really know how to describe what happened. I couldn't put my finger on it. I have these pictures in my head-freeze frames of what happened. They are like still shots. \n\nLater on in childhood, maybe when I was 5 or 6, I was abused again. Some older kids(they were teenagers) in my neighborhood decided that one of the kids they bullied needed to prove he was \u201ca real man\u201d, as in, not gay, and they decided that the best way for him to do this was to sexually assault a girl. They *used me* to prove he was not gay. \n\nThe government got involved when I started telling stories about these incidents at my elementary school. I was taken away from my mother for a short time and ended up sleeping in a cot in a social worker\u2019s office, next to her computer and office chair. I remember the social worker was kindhearted and really wanted to look out for me.

I'm guessing you're saying that you should take the time to reconcile your feelings before moving on instead of repressing.\n\nI can't think there's a situation where dwelling on the trauma is a good thing. It is objectively better to move on than not right? The time taken is where people can judge harshly 'Oh get over it already it happened years ago' but its still better to move on right?

There's a great deal of process involved. \"Baby steps\" and lots of assistance from people you trust. When someone just says, \"get over it\", they are just making a person feel bad for something that's beyond control at that time. A drowning man can't save his own life. Someone needs to stop the commentary and actually throw a life preserver out to the victim.\n\nBut we live in a society that reinforces social darwinism. So it's normal to just say \"get over it\", or \"she's just walked into becoming another statistic\". That attitude makes everyone feel better about objective suffering so nobody has to get uncomfortable. Survival of the fittest! Unfortunately, we let others define what it means to be \"fit\" instead of taking responsibility to define it ourselves.
