Nowhere are there terms for the use of the US dollar. You seem to have just made this up. Please provide a justification for this assumption. The Tax Code is just the body of regulation regarding when individuals are forced to pay dollars to the state. Now, putting aside the fact that no one consented to the tax code, and that in fact it was forced on us by our supposed representatives and other government officials (who are also forced on us), the fact is the tax code is not a terms of service for the U.S. dollar. The dollar existed before there was an income tax.\n\nYour analogy about not taking a loaf of bread from a shopkeeper is quite different. The shopkeeper owns what he sells. By contrast, if I hold U.S. dollars, I *own* those dollars. The government does not own them. I am not holding them as a borrower of money from the government. Whether they have actual value or not is a different question, but the fact is that I, and I alone, own the dollars.\n\nYour argument really makes no sense. There are legal tender laws that force us to pay taxes in dollars. Participation in the economy is a necessary fact of existence if one doesn't want to live in the woods by oneself, and even then, I would probably be forced to pay property taxes for the land I owned in the woods, and those taxes would have to be paid for in dollars...you see the problem here.\n\nAgain, please provide a justification for your assertion that the use of the dollar is somehow consent for taxation. The tax code is forced upon us, and therefore cannot be construed as consent. There is no implied consent because the government does not own the dollars that it produces.

I am serious.\n\nI think the state is a substitute for the (bigger) family for the most people. I also think that many/most people do not want to lose the emotional values they associate with the family and a society within a state, like solidarity, peace, recognition and so on. It may seem that most people are quite hostile to each other, but that is only the case because they - as it is now - can _never_ lose the _state family_. They are very unlikely to be outcast. They will face relatively soft sanctions for misconducts and the integrity/stability of those _state families_ are way superior to those of their own, original families in terms of timespan and financial possibilities since the second World War at least. They already are agreeing to the net drawbacks even if they may be bigger than the net benefits because what they most fear is losing this last backing - it's largely emotional. Actually I think this a correct description of nearly all non-Anarchists. This is why I'm thinking, that most people wouldn't opt-out.\n\nTo the second point: The ability to _save_, to plan ahead for years, is what made humanity the dominant species on this planet ~100000 years ago. I see that there are many people, many young people, who live very wasteful, but I would ascribe that fact not to a general mental inability to save but to a _lack of need to do so_. Parents are covering their losses, are paying their rents, their debts, their everything. And since the state seems to replace the parental care when grown up, the state is covering the losses, be it welfare or insolvency. The need and incentive for rational thinking vanished. Scarcity is a thing of the past and most dramas about it are just \"#firstworldproblems\". Very few young people in the western world ever experienced true poverty, and not many have ever really worked hard at the age of 25. The older one gets, the less delusional one is. You can ascribe that to the _success of society_, but as Nietzsche stated, living under the illusion of safety is dangerous.\n\nI maybe have to add that I got this cold, dry and realistic view, when my mum kicked me out when I was 18. I have never taken welfare. I won't ever depend on someone else solely and I would recommend everyone to live like that. When I get 60 or have an accident, I will have enough savings. Of course I have smypathized with Rand, Rothbard and co. since then.\n\nI have specifically asked for your moral theory because - in all honesty - I suspect you have a flaw in your logic. An opinion about morality is not just like taste. It is always deducted from a more basic set of rules - one could say axioms. If the conclusion is correct and consistent, then the morality is flawless. Talking about the argumentation chain and basic assumptions is way clearer then just talking about morality as an opinion which would end in a boring circle jerk. For example, the only way a nazi could ever consistently argue for \"nazi morality\" is if the basic assumption is that aryans are superior beings and jews are inferior beings. I could say killing jews is immoral, he could say \"but it's not, it's moral!\". As a last consequence, it's not a discussion about morality itself, but about the worth of different human beings. So it should be more rewarding talking about this instead of morality.

I think that as you say, \"roads, bridges, infrastructure, police, fire, etc\" clearly and easily are shown to benefit all.  Most people would not argue that those items benefit society as a whole.  I am with you there.  But I also think Social Security and the various welfare programs benefit all, but not as obviously/clearly.\n\nStick with me here\u2026..\nI do not have a source handy, but it seems to be well accepted that the long term tax dollar cost to \u201csociety\u201d providing some small level of support is much lower than if the small support was withheld and folks are left to fend for themselves without any structured support.  This is delving into an entirely different topic, but this where concept of **\"it is cheaper to help them now versus later\"** comes into play with healthcare as well as food stamps/nutrition programs.  The cost of repeated/regular emergency room visits for non-emergency medical care when it is a city/state run hospital is much higher than if cheap health coverage or low cost services/clinics were made available at a cost to the same taxpayers.  Same goes for food stamps.  Giving Sally Smith $20 a week to buy milk and bread for their small children is less costly than having to pay for the fallout from their small kids growing up with nutritional deficiencies.  In my humble opinion, Social Security and the various welfare programs provide these same methods of reducing the long term \u201csocietal\u201d burden by spending $10 now instead of $20 later.  By allowing for people to \u201copt-out\u201d of SS, there is a higher chance they will not save for their own needs and will then need to utilize these other sources of support.  This then reduces the resources in those programs available for others, which then drives the overall cost to \u201csociety\u201d higher than it needs to be since people go to the ER and eat Top Ramen 3 times a day.\n\nAs you mention, the social security program is currently underfunded and is projected to tank in a few decades.  But I sure hope you do not actually believe that Congress will allow it to run out of money or tank.  It is a massively popular system at this point (although when it was first created it was viewed as many are viewing Obamacare currently), and politicians would be committing professional suicide if they allowed it to fail when it is projected to fail.  It will be saved.  There is no doubt in my mind.  So I think using the reasoning of **\"it won't benefit me in any way, or anyone in my age group\"** is not a logical claim.  But that is completely separate from the statement of \u201cI should be allowed to opt-out\u201d.  I think if you asked people to change your view that **\"it won't benefit me in any way, or anyone in my age group\"**, you would probably have your view changed by people much smarter than I am when they bring in all sorts of math and political mumbo jumbo about how SS will never actually die.  \n\nEDIT:  A source for the tangent I went on about health care\n[HERE!!!](http://www.nachc.com/client/documents/publications-resources/IB_EMER_07.pdf)\n"}, {"id": "cm0sfud", "body": "roads, bridges, infrastructure, police, fire, etc benefit everyone.\n\nwelfare only benefits the selected people who recieve it. thats the difference.\n\nsocial security only benefits those who receive it.\n\nI want to opt out because the social security program is underfunded and is projected to tank in a few decades. all the people who were forced to put money in won't get any out. it won't benefit me in any way, or anyone in my age group. thats a lot of people getting fucked over."}, {"id": "cm0uoqs", "body": "&gt; welfare only benefits the selected people who recieve it.\n\nNot true at all.

Indeed, they are very, very successful:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/06/13/us/worst-charities/\n\nLest you think that's a weird outlier, here's a big ugly list.  You can ignore the % of money given in direct aid, as that is not necessarily a good indicator of a charity's quality (but take a look anyway, because it's nasty).  Instead focus on how much of their raised money they spent on raising more money.  The charities on this list tend to spend at least 90% of their donations paying the advertisers who gather said donations, which means that their amazing efficiency and effectiveness *starts* at 10%, then works its way down from there through administrative costs and other more boring inefficiencies.\n\nhttp://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/\n\nNot only do they do remarkably little, but they soak up the donations of those kind philanthropists who might otherwise be able to actually help people with their money if they knew to donate to more efficient and effective charities.  The trouble is that in a free market, the charity's job is not to help people, it is to make money, and the most *effective* and *efficient* way to do that is to invest all your money in advertising, and only a minimal amount in actual charity that can be featured in your advertising, since your customers are not the ones who experience the product and will be unable to notice when they are not getting what they pay for.\n\nThe most successful charities will inevitably be the ones with the best marketing departments, not the ones with the best outcomes.  It is only through government intervention and, unfortunately, more marketing, that charities with good impacts get any market share at all.  Charities like the red cross rely on governmental support in addition to private donors, which violates your ethic of voluntary contribution.\n\nI'll get back to you when I get in touch with old contacts about the other, less obvious type of charity failure."}, {"id": "cm0rg5h", "body": "To anyone who said that Social Security is for the sake of people who need help, which it is, you should not that social security is not the only option for these people.\n\nprivate charities, family members, and friends can help too.\n\nin terms of a the morals of a safety net, i think its wrong to force one person to give money or resources to another. this benefits only the person who gets the stuff, not the person who gives it. transactions of this sort should be voluntary.\n\nwith those factors in mind, any comments?\n"}, {"id": "cm0rvdp", "body": "&gt; this benefits only the person who gets the stuff, not the person who gives it. transactions of this sort should be voluntary.\n\nIt benefits society.

It is not being selfless but just because someone isn't selfless doesn't automatically make them selfish.\n\nWith that said, my entire argument is that not voting because you don't see value in is purely a short term view. it was doesn't take into consideration the fact that if the wrong people get elected it can be at great cost. Yup me the people who didn't vote in the election when Hitler became a member of Germany's legislature are partially responsible for his actions"}, {"id": "cm0onti", "body": "You said there are many reasons to vote/be involved with the political process, what are they? I don't think you really clarified. \n\nIs your argument that if people were more attached to politics, then the government actually serve the people? Yes obviously, but this isn't going to change OP's, or anyone's view. One, this is an awfully idealistic, utopian request of people, because voting is directly against individuals' rational self interest. You should look up the problem of rational ignorance, as this is a very very important inherent flaw with democracy itself. You stating that if *everyone* participated in the voting process (assuming that they even vote for the \"correct\" politician, has nothing to do with OP's view. His view (Or at least sounds like this) is that *as an individual*, the act of voting is not in his rational self interest. Which is true. Me or you or anyone voting will almost *certainly* have absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, and thus no effect on our lives, besides the good \"feeling\" you may get from doing it (which clearly the majority of people do not have). It sounds like your argument is that because *if* everyone did not (or does not) vote it would produce a negative outcome, *then* it is wrong for an individual not to vote. But this type of argument is obviously fallacious. Imagine an analogy: if everyone in society (or 70% or whatever) chose to be a philosopher as opposed to any other career path, it would have a detrimental effect on society. I don't think anyone disputes that. But does that mean it is wrong for an individual to become a philosopher? Of course not. \n\n&gt; Lastly I would like to ask what economic benefit there is to posting this CMV? If your time is SO valuable and you never waste a second, what are you doing on Reddit which I think we all can agree can be a huge time waster\n\nThis may not pertain directly to OP's view, but I would guess that s/he would agree with what I'm about to say. You are assuming that \"benefit\" can only be monetary. As I explained, one might get some other benefit from voting, like a happy feeling about themselves, and someone may get some other benefit from posting to reddit. \"Value\" here is subjective.\n\nedit: /u/MattyD85 you may want to read this, it won't show in your inbox cause it was a reply. but i agree with your view and this comment could help you defend it"}, {"id": "cm0r8sl", "body": "Nailed it square on the head!

But selfish doesn't typically mean acting out of self-interest (which we all do); selfish typically means acting out of self-interest *at the expense of others*. When OP's vote does nothing to help others (regardless of whether he is informed or not), it is hard to see how his declining to do it (even for personal reasons) is *selfish* in the relevant, morally repulsive sense. I wouldn't call you selfish for not taking time out of your day to pray to Poseidon for safe sea voyages for sailors, for example. Such an action contributes no benefit to others, and as such there doesn't seem to be any obligation to do it instead of whatever personal entertainment you were about to enjoy."}, {"id": "cm1e6oo", "body": "&gt; What about the wisdom of crowds?

I don't have numbers to answer this question, but I'll say from the start that I'm very pessimistic about the number of informed voters. Politics seems to me to be about how much uninformed support you can rally to your side with fear mongering, mudslinging, and propaganda.\n\n&gt; As far as the decision of voting being highly complex, that's ridiculous. This is representative Democracy, you're choosing people who will be informed and smart on your behalf.\n\nWhile this is true, I am skeptical of whether most voters are informed enough about their chosen representative to be epistemically warranted in their support for him/her.\n\n&gt; And, how do we know ex ante who is informed and not informed? We don't. That's why democracy is better than having a select group like an aristocracy who made decisions. It's like Winston Churchill said, \"Democracy is the worst system except all the others that have been tried.\"\n\nI wasn't claiming to know ex ante who specifically is informed and who is not. Nor was I suggesting that an aristocratically controlled government is better. Nor was I denying that democracy is the best option. I was only saying that those who cannot vote well shouldn't vote at all. And they shouldn't.\n\n&gt; On the selfishness point, I was saying that his reasoning was selfish. He wasn't saying, I'm too stupid to vote appropriately. He was evaluating voting purely from its personal benefit to him. That's the essence of being selfish.\n\nAlright. But selfish doesn't typically mean acting out of self-interest (which we all do); selfish typically means acting out of self-interest *at the expense of others*. When OP's vote does nothing to help others (regardless of whether he is informed or not), it is hard to see how his declining to do it (even for personal reasons) is *selfish* in the relevant, morally repulsive sense. I wouldn't call you selfish for not taking time out of your day to pray to Poseidon for safe sea voyages for sailors, for example. Such an action contributes no benefit to others, and as such there doesn't seem to be any obligation to do it instead of whatever personal entertainment you were about to enjoy."}, {"id": "cm1hj7a", "body": "I was responding to the OP's reasoning which was purely selfish and not just selfish, but purely focused on looking at everything from an individual perspective.  \n\nThat's where this whole argument goes wrong.

Those interactions have small but measurable effects that will ripple outward and begin to affect the larger picture. That is the power of your vote.\n\nLet's say you convince 30 people in this thread that your viewpoint is correct. They now believe as you do, and stop voting. Furthermore, 10 of those 30 actively try to convince people in their circles as well. The people they convince go to their circles and convince others. Eventually, the number of people deciding not to vote becomes a significant number, enough to decide an election. Well, then the value of your vote becomes a chance to better your society by electing representatives which will hopefully write and pass laws that are aligned with your beliefs and priorities.\n\nLook at the last election. Only 1/3rd of voters voted and as a result, a minority platform was elected to office. That's a large number of people who approached voting as you do, thinking there's no value in it. In truth, by not voting, you are abdicating your citizenship and influencing others to do the same.\n\nIf you're really interested in seeing the value of your singular vote, you should try spending time in a country where that right is taken away.\n\nYou are a man holding a bucket of water, trying to put out the fire in your house. By not adding your contribution, you are allowing others to decide whether your house burns to the ground or not."}, {"id": "cm0w1er", "body": "You're the only one that has come close to making me reconsider my view.

Or do you give them your honest opinion? You don't have to do much to influence another person in this matter. Particularly since people have become increasingly fed up with the entire electoral system.\n\nYour argument is well-reasoned and seemingly logical, but it's an illusion. The problem is it's a well-crafted illusion that feeds itself and is easy to believe because the good that you can do by voting is nearly impossible to measure. It acts like a snowball rolling down a hill gradually becoming bigger until it destroys everything in front of it. People feel like their vote doesn't count so they don't vote, which makes their vote not count. \n\nThis is how a small number of people control a large number of people: by convincing them that the *individual* is too small to matter. Real change is difficult and requires you to go forth and convince others of your point of view, to gather those who are like minded and band together for a larger purpose. By choosing not to choose, you're just adding snow to that snowball as is rolls."}, {"id": "2m3grp", "body": "I don't vote and here's why.  Everything I do I think \"Is what I'm putting into this worth what I'm getting out of it?\"  I go to work daily because I'm being paid for my time and it's a salary that is fair.  I keep driving my 10 year old sedan because it's in my best economic interest to continue to drive that car, even though I have the money to buy a new car.\n\nWhen it comes to voting I don't see the value.  It takes at least 30 minutes of my time to go to the voting location, stand in line, and finally vote.  What is my benefit?  Would the election result be any different if I did or didn't vote?  No.  Throughout history the number of elections that were decided by one vote is incredibly low, so I don't invest my time.\n\nIn summary, the cost of voting isn't worth the minuscule value gained from having my vote counted gained to support the candidate I think should win. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sometimes things have to win by a certain amount.\n\nSecond, politicians and pundits often cite a \"mandate\" when the win by a large percentage. With more voting and a better representation of what people actually believe, it is easier to see whether there actually *is* a \"mandate\" of some sort.

Weird group selection theories notwithstanding, if you're talking about the survival of societies, nothing you say about how monogamy might benefit a society really applies to an individual's reproductive success, and so won't contribute to any kind of biological tendency towards a mating strategy.

I'd be interested in considering this further.\n\nNot OP, but a Biology Major who has studied this stuff a LOT.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that true monogamy is relatively rare in nature. Most of the time, when biologists talk about monogamy, we're talking about social monogamy, not sexual monogamy. That is, animals will stay paired for the rest of their lives, but will still get a little action in on the side. Birds more than other animals tend to buck this trend, and have a significant amount of truly monogamous species (that is, socially and sexually monogamous). Interestingly humans are very similar to monogamous bird species, with about 15% of us having extra-pair matings (aka cheating)\n\nI think your major problem here though is that you're assuming that there is only one reproductive strategy for humans (and maybe for all animals). This is simply not true. Many animals have multiple reproductive tactics that can be relatively flexible in response to environmental and social changes, and these serve the purpose of maximizing reproductive success. These strategies depend on how scare food is, how likely the young are to be predated, etc. Each species has to carefully balance the amount of offspring they produce with the amount of energy they have available to ensure that those offspring survive, and are in-turn successful at reproducing themselves.\n\nTake, for instance, the prairie vole. Voles have three major strategies: Dominant, roaming, and subordinate. Dominant males usually have 2-3 females as mates, control their own territories, and tend not to mate outside of those 2-3 females. Roaming males don't have a territory of their own, and basically run around trying to mate with different females. These strategies can change depending on population density, and the amount of suitable habitat. For example, in an area with lots of good habitat, and high population density, more males are likely to adopt a dominant strategy, because this maximizes their reproductive success.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at here, is that you can probably think of humans like this too. Some individuals will maximize their reproductive success by being truly monogamous. Some will maximize their's by being polygamous. In this sense, I think you might change your mind to \"*Some* humans aren't meant to be monogamous, but others are\" because this is probably true.\n\n"}, {"id": "cm0jjbl", "body": "&gt;Can you explain?

Most of the time, when biologists talk about monogamy, we're talking about social monogamy, not sexual monogamy. That is, animals will stay paired for the rest of their lives, but will still get a little action in on the side. Birds more than other animals tend to buck this trend, and have a significant amount of truly monogamous species (that is, socially and sexually monogamous). Interestingly humans are very similar to monogamous bird species, with about 15% of us having extra-pair matings (aka cheating)\n\nI think your major problem here though is that you're assuming that there is only one reproductive strategy for humans (and maybe for all animals). This is simply not true. Many animals have multiple reproductive tactics that can be relatively flexible in response to environmental and social changes, and these serve the purpose of maximizing reproductive success. These strategies depend on how scare food is, how likely the young are to be predated, etc. Each species has to carefully balance the amount of offspring they produce with the amount of energy they have available to ensure that those offspring survive, and are in-turn successful at reproducing themselves.\n\nTake, for instance, the prairie vole. Voles have three major strategies: Dominant, roaming, and subordinate. Dominant males usually have 2-3 females as mates, control their own territories, and tend not to mate outside of those 2-3 females. Roaming males don't have a territory of their own, and basically run around trying to mate with different females. These strategies can change depending on population density, and the amount of suitable habitat. For example, in an area with lots of good habitat, and high population density, more males are likely to adopt a dominant strategy, because this maximizes their reproductive success.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at here, is that you can probably think of humans like this too. Some individuals will maximize their reproductive success by being truly monogamous. Some will maximize their's by being polygamous.

In the past, monogamy and closed marriages allowed for arguably better chances for the child in the family to survive (based on increased number of dedicated caregivers), increased chances of the family as a unit to survive and thus perpetuate, and especially in the realm of disease and death, served as a second tier quarantine for the syphilis and chlamydias of the world.\n\nIn our current social environment, it is still something worth doing, but we can see that the sacrosanct nature of monogamy is being questioned, as it's benefits are becoming less intuitive. The idea of not only \"one night stands\" and meaningless sex has become more understood as an issue (possibly on its way to simple social acceptance such as porn has become), and couples seem to be increasingly open to the idea of thirds, swings, and other such kinky materials (though this could be an increase in noticing bias).\n\nTaking that all into consideration, and that the trends of the day continue to perpetuate in such a manor, I would posit that monogamy will not soon, but rapidly deteriorate as people make more monamorous and less monogamous decisions for their increasingly busy lives."}, {"id": "cm0ifaf", "body": "Monogamy actually does offer some biological advantages.

Also, testosterone is a powerful thing.\n\nMarriage, for example, is a social construct and legal contract more than anything. And, whether married or not, failed relationships and cheating is just way too prevalent to be coincidental.

Based on the fact that we used to be cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on, I believe that while we have clearly evolved from that, biology has still framed us to struggle with monogamy. In many ways, I think we have animalistic tendencies when it comes to interpersonal relationships and that people will always struggle with looking for someone better because of natural selection and all that jazz. Also, testosterone is a powerful thing.\n\nMarriage, for example, is a social construct and legal contract more than anything. And, whether married or not, failed relationships and cheating is just way too prevalent to be coincidental. I think our bodies struggle with remaining loyal to one person, even if we are emotionally complex enough to realize that this is wrong.\n\nWhile, from an idealistic stance, I think it's awesome to think we could find one partner who is \"the one,\" and successfully remain with them indefinitely, I have a hard time believing that is indeed the case.

Maybe for some people monogamy really is against their biology, whereas for others it's the only thing that will do."}, {"id": "cm0p99r", "body": "This is a wonderful reply! Really got me thinking.

Too much exists in our biological social structure (not cultural)  that suggests monogamy is the status quo.   Thing is this differs between genders as well.

Humans are evolving into having monogamous relationships as a result of civilised societies. These laws itself are a representation of how humans are evolving.\n\nAlthough there are still some people who cheat and have multiple spouses, the majority prefer to be monogamous. And just like how there are those who cheat, there are also the less evolved (relatives) species of ape.\n\nThese social contructs that you label is also an evolutionary adeptation that humans are undergoing inorder to survive in an environment that requires order. Order of which prevents anarchy and rule by strength.\n\nAs an example, 5000 years ago, influence was easily managed by strength. The strongest take and the weak struggle, 7000 years later, strength is not enough. Ofcourse there are those who attempt to take by force (dictators, rapists) however it is not viable as an evolutionary advantage because the short term benefits outweigh the long term ramifications. Now, it requires that more people 'think' inorder to survive as thinking is the evolutionary advantage. Ofcourse, our biology is not fully suited to this, and so those who continue to use strength and are incapable of thought (not literally, but as a concept for advanced rationalisation) soon becoming evolutionarily inept.\n\nEventually, those not suited to living in society will disappear or become the minority while those who think, become the majority. Similarly, this is an example of biology.\n\nBiology is not permanent. With every iteration and every child, our biology is different as a result of mutations. Ofcourse basic instincts may reside, but it is nothing compared to our ancestors. Some have more of this residue and other have less. Cheating or having multiple spouses is not as common as monogamous relationships, just like how murderers and rapists are not as common as business men and academics.\n\nTL:DR biology is not permanent due to evolution, so why think that humans cant evolve away from primordial mating rituals towards monogamous relationships as a result of adapting to a society?"}, {"id": "cm0i1zb", "body": "Biologically speaking, humans weren't intended to sit all day, working on computers.

Nobody is surprised that humans aren't \"meant\" to fly into space. As such we recognize that this is a very difficult feat on all accounts and in fact there is heroism in breaking through bounds of human abilities. We're also keenly aware of the negative affects that can be caused so we take great great care in monitoring these people psychologically and physically when they come back from space etc etc. \n\nAnd yet in our society it's reasonable to eviscerate somebody as a betrayer and monster if after 25 years of monogamy they have the act of human sexual intercourse with another person when they said (and thought) they wouldn't when they were 22 years old! And some people get sincerely angry with their partner if they so much as admit that they find another person sexually attractive.\n\nNow of course any time somebody \"lies\" or breaks a promise there's going to be anger and that in and of itself isn't unreasonable. But if it can be said that humans aren't \"naturally monogamous\" (and I would agree with OP that there's some really good evidence) we can stop expecting such things from our partners and projecting horrific social shame over things that are actually very very difficult for us.
