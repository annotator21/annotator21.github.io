How you are born should not define you, but rather how you conduct yourself as a person to the best of your abilities. That said, I'm hesitant to ever self-identify as a \"feminist\" because I personally feel that there is a lot of emotional baggage tied to the term on both sides of the gender divide.\n\nThe problem, as I see it, is that we've come so far that the lines are thin, but distinctive, and you've got a lot of people who either cannot see the divide, or refuse to. Issues like the wage gap and the stereotyping of women in traditionally male dominated fields like technology, science, engineering, etc... should be fairly self evident; the only problem is that these things are often subtle outside of statistics. Someone can easily see that their own personal IT department has plenty of women, or that their boss is a woman, and then think everything is fine. And, when we exist in a society where your own personal earnings are a fairly private matter, it's hard to see whether or not you're inherently making much more than your female co-workers, or then if promotions and hiring are driven by sexism or legitimate qualifications. What might be statistically obvious on the macroeconomic scale is not always as tangible on the microeconomic scale- in every day life. There are, of course, plenty of studies that have tried to show objectively and irrefutably that there is sexism in areas like hiring by submitting identical resumes to employers and replacing the names for a man and a woman; even still, it's difficult to make people see what they have not experienced directly. Whereas a hundred years ago it was blatantly obvious that women were under privileged, still fighting for suffrage- that basic societal right to vote on how you will be governed- today it is not so clear, and this isn't a bad thing! That we have come so far that the lines are often difficult to see is good! We've made progress! Unfortunately, it just makes it that much more of a struggle to have an informed discussion on the matter without having to do your own extensive research, whereas in the past it was much easier to point to your wife or mother and be able to objectively say \"she doesn't have the right to vote\", or any other such issue. Without such research, a lot of people simply turn to their own morals and confirmation biases, making any \"informed and rational discussion\" on the matter quickly descend into an emotionally charged conflict.  \n\nThe other issue, of course, is trying discuss such things online. For better or worse, the Internet is an anonymous system; which can be empowering for many. It is a tool for the exchange of information and for discussion, but also for the creation of caricatures of ourselves. There are a lot of people who tend towards the extremes in personality while online, being trolls or trying their best to be activists and heroes. The trolls, however, stir up anger and often get much more attention than they deserve, which leads to the problem we have now. There are plenty of misandrists calling themselves feminists to legitimize their matriarchal mindset, and there are likewise plenty of misogynists who identify as MRA to cover up their patriarchal mindset. From this, there are plenty of people who will nitpick details utterly out of context to support their side, or just fabricate information all together. When we come across people like this, making their straw man arguments, it's hard to feel good about either side of the discussion. There are plenty of women who would probably say their views of men have been negatively affected by looking at some Internet forums, and men who would say the same of women. There's the \"feminazi's\" and the \"neckbeards\". Then you have so many young people who have grown up with the Internet and are starting to see Reddit threads, Tumblr posts, and dear god the YouTube comment section... what you have is a lot of these really young impressionable people learning about these issues from the most outlandish sources. You get Call of Duty lobbies descending into teens and younger slinging racial, homophobic, and sexist slurs across shitty microphones because they haven't been raised any better. Even on the more subtle level, there's a double standard, where men are called \"pigs\" for liking a woman in a skimpy cosplay or in swim attire by the same kind of women who see no issue in walking out of a Hollister with the desaturated pictures of toned shirtless men adorning their bags. There's the meme I think we've all seen circle around of the thin man and fat woman, and the fat woman and thin man, where the heavy woman is empowered to defy societal views of beauty and health but the man is criticized for not being in the same league as the woman. Whether or not these sorts of contradictions transcend into everyday life and our interactions is of course hard to see, but even an exaggerated caricature of reality has some basis in truth.\n\nTrying to have an informed conversation in the midst of that becomes very difficult. Personally, I'd like to see everyone equal, but I will admit I'm jaded by all the hatred of men I see in memes, and often it seems that \"not all men are like that\" isn't a legitimate way to express one's disdain for the picture being painted of their own gender. Sometimes it makes me ashamed to have happened to be born with a penis... and I sometimes feel like people see me as a potential rapist, paedophile, or wife beater by default... which isn't right. There are always going to be bastards and bitches who misrepresent their gender, and humanity as a whole. But there are plenty of people who sit firmly in the middle, too tired to bother any more. That's about where I am. I find myself getting upset any time I see something \"feminist\", or hear someone describe themselves as such, because I'm of the expectation at this point that it's really going to be some hateful troll trying to rally women against men. And then you try to bring up men's issues such as the likelihood for a court to decide in favour of a woman in cases of child support, divorce, accused rape... and it gets dismissed as being sexist. So really, there's just a lot of animosity all around which has made everyone too exhausted to want to fight it any more. We're progressing as a society, but sometimes it feels like it's just too exacerbating. \n\n**TL;DR - There's a legitimate discussion to be had, but between all the trolls and Internet excess, I think most of us are too jaded and tired to bother any more and default to being upset any time we see a gender issue post.**"}, {"id": "cm5i8e5", "body": "Okay, this is a controversial and sensitive topic that can create a lot of angst and stir up a lot of strong feelings, so I'm going to approach it as delicately as possible. \n\nSpeaking as a male, but also as a person who would consider themselves fairly liberal and fairly progressive, I can say that I believe whole heartedly in creating a society of equality among the sexes, gender identities, sexualities, races... everyone.

This paper makes a claim, the effect of X on Y, but then pulls a very obvious bait and switch. Instead of measuring X, it measures Z. Here's how:\n\nThe study claims that women applying for **faculty positions** are discriminated against. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure that at all. What it measures is the process of applying for **lab manager positions**. It's right there in the abstract. It may seem like a small detail, but this bait and switch is a doozy. Here's why:\n\nI've gone through the academic hiring procedure. It's a gauntlet. You submit a hiring package to a university containing a set of documents (usually 4) describing your experience (your CV), your research interests, your teaching philosophy, a cover letter, and a diversity declaration, along with 3 letters of recommendation. This package is vetted by a hiring committee, normally 4 or 5 profs, who then decide who to interview of the (sometimes) hundreds of applicants. If you are interviewed, you are flown out to the university and for an entire day you meet with profs (I met with 20 in one day on one interview) and give multiple talks about past and future research. You have lunch with students, you have dinner with the faculty... all the time you are being evaluated. It's exhausting. Then, the hiring committee repeats the process with 4 or 5 other candidates before arguing for ages about which aspirational professor to offer the job to. And then, the dean has to make a final approval for a totally separate layer of control. It's a unique and grueling process. Everything about you is considered.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the hiring of a lab manager. A lab manager is NOT a scientist. They are more like an administrative assistant. They do the books, process the orders, etc. They do not need to have a PhD or any education or experience what-so-ever. They don't have to be (or have ever been) students (in stark contrast to the title of the paper). In many cases, the lab manager is the spouse of the professor in charge of the lab. To be hired, they submit a CV to one person (the prof in charge) and that prof can hire you on a whim with no oversight from anyone, with or without an interview (another thing not considered by the paper). The faculty has nothing to do with it (again, in stark contrast to the title of the paper). \n\nThis study claims to inform us on how the first process works but it clearly measured the second (poorly as well, it seems). Classic bait and switch. How it was published in PNAS should be a mystery, but they have a history of this sort of thing and a shameful history of shoddy or non existent peer review. \n\nI am not saying that personal biases cannot influence the process of hiring in academia. But this study tells us absolutely nothing about that. Let's also ignore that Universities often openly, transparently and purposely give preference to female applicants. It also ignores that the vast majority of lab managers are women. In my faculty, we have 13, all women. In light of that, the bias they measured could even be described as affirmative action! \n\nThis is just one example.

It is true that often lab managers are people who have at one time had a foot in science but the job has nothing to do with being a scientist and in no way reflects how scientists are hired.

It may take a while to comb through it but I'm willing. A faster demonstration would be to go back and look at the responses to the hurricane paper I mentioned.

In academic science hiring, women are expressly encouraged to apply and hiring committees are put under a lot of pressure to hire women. I know as I went through it and am now on the other side of the equation. Women have a massive advantage here. The fact that the academic process involves many people with a huge amount of oversight from HR, the Dean's office, students, etc. tells us that it's not comparable to the hiring decisions in the case of lab manager, which is made by a single person with no oversight. Also, as I mentioned, the bias towards hiring men for lab manager roles may in fact stem from the fact that men are incredibly underrepresented in this role. "}, {"id": "cm5y1qx", "body": "Sure.\n\nFirst, I'd just like to say that the second study is a bit more complicated and the problems with it are a bit technical and there have already been a lot of people with better stats knowledge than me who have torn it apart.

The title of the study is: \"Science faculty\u2019s subtle gender biases favor\nmale students\"\n\nThis, however, is not at all what the study is measuring. Even if all the stats have been done correctly, the controls were set up correctly, the results were properly treated, etc. etc. etc., none of that would matter at all. This is because none of that would excuse the obvious fact that the premise of the study and its conclusions in no way reflect what they actually measured:\n\nOne would expect that if I publish a paper called 'The effect of X on Y' that I would have measured X and determined how it was affecting Y. This paper makes a claim, the effect of X on Y, but then pulls a very obvious bait and switch. Instead of measuring X, it measures Z. Here's how:\n\nThe study claims that women applying for **faculty positions** are discriminated against. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure that at all. What it measures is the process of applying for **lab manager positions**. It's right there in the abstract. It may seem like a small detail, but this bait and switch is a doozy. Here's why:\n\nI've gone through the academic hiring procedure. It's a gauntlet. You submit a hiring package to a university containing a set of documents (usually 4) describing your experience (your CV), your research interests, your teaching philosophy, a cover letter, and a diversity declaration, along with 3 letters of recommendation. This package is vetted by a hiring committee, normally 4 or 5 profs, who then decide who to interview of the (sometimes) hundreds of applicants. If you are interviewed, you are flown out to the university and for an entire day you meet with profs (I met with 20 in one day on one interview) and give multiple talks about past and future research. You have lunch with students, you have dinner with the faculty... all the time you are being evaluated. It's exhausting. Then, the hiring committee repeats the process with 4 or 5 other candidates before arguing for ages about which aspirational professor to offer the job to. And then, the dean has to make a final approval for a totally separate layer of control. It's a unique and grueling process. Everything about you is considered.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the hiring of a lab manager. A lab manager is NOT a scientist. They are more like an administrative assistant. They do the books, process the orders, etc. They do not need to have a PhD or any education or experience what-so-ever. They don't have to be (or have ever been) students (in stark contrast to the title of the paper). In many cases, the lab manager is the spouse of the professor in charge of the lab. To be hired, they submit a CV to one person (the prof in charge) and that prof can hire you on a whim with no oversight from anyone, with or without an interview (another thing not considered by the paper). The faculty has nothing to do with it (again, in stark contrast to the title of the paper). \n\nThis study claims to inform us on how the first process works but it clearly measured the second (poorly as well, it seems). Classic bait and switch. How it was published in PNAS should be a mystery, but they have a history of this sort of thing and a shameful history of shoddy or non existent peer review. \n\nI am not saying that personal biases cannot influence the process of hiring in academia. But this study tells us absolutely nothing about that. Let's also ignore that Universities often openly, transparently and purposely give preference to female applicants. It also ignores that the vast majority of lab managers are women. In my faculty, we have 13, all women. In light of that, the bias they measured could even be described as affirmative action! \n\nThis is just one example.

And then, the dean has to make a final approval for a totally separate layer of control. It's a unique and grueling process. Everything about you is considered.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the hiring of a lab manager. A lab manager is NOT a scientist. They are more like an administrative assistant. They do the books, process the orders, etc. They do not need to have a PhD or any education or experience what-so-ever. They don't have to be (or have ever been) students (in stark contrast to the title of the paper). In many cases, the lab manager is the spouse of the professor in charge of the lab. To be hired, they submit a CV to one person (the prof in charge) and that prof can hire you on a whim with no oversight from anyone, with or without an interview (another thing not considered by the paper). The faculty has nothing to do with it (again, in stark contrast to the title of the paper). \n\nThis study claims to inform us on how the first process works but it clearly measured the second (poorly as well, it seems). Classic bait and switch. How it was published in PNAS should be a mystery, but they have a history of this sort of thing and a shameful history of shoddy or non existent peer review. \n\nI am not saying that personal biases cannot influence the process of hiring in academia. But this study tells us absolutely nothing about that. Let's also ignore that Universities often openly, transparently and purposely give preference to female applicants. It also ignores that the vast majority of lab managers are women. In my faculty, we have 13, all women. In light of that, the bias they measured could even be described as affirmative action! \n\nThis is just one example. This sort of thing in endemic in both the social sciences and academic feminism in particular.

How you are born should not define you, but rather how you conduct yourself as a person to the best of your abilities. That said, I'm hesitant to ever self-identify as a \"feminist\" because I personally feel that there is a lot of emotional baggage tied to the term on both sides of the gender divide.\n\nThe problem, as I see it, is that we've come so far that the lines are thin, but distinctive, and you've got a lot of people who either cannot see the divide, or refuse to. Issues like the wage gap and the stereotyping of women in traditionally male dominated fields like technology, science, engineering, etc... should be fairly self evident; the only problem is that these things are often subtle outside of statistics. Someone can easily see that their own personal IT department has plenty of women, or that their boss is a woman, and then think everything is fine. And, when we exist in a society where your own personal earnings are a fairly private matter, it's hard to see whether or not you're inherently making much more than your female co-workers, or then if promotions and hiring are driven by sexism or legitimate qualifications. What might be statistically obvious on the macroeconomic scale is not always as tangible on the microeconomic scale- in every day life. There are, of course, plenty of studies that have tried to show objectively and irrefutably that there is sexism in areas like hiring by submitting identical resumes to employers and replacing the names for a man and a woman; even still, it's difficult to make people see what they have not experienced directly. Whereas a hundred years ago it was blatantly obvious that women were under privileged, still fighting for suffrage- that basic societal right to vote on how you will be governed- today it is not so clear, and this isn't a bad thing! That we have come so far that the lines are often difficult to see is good! We've made progress! Unfortunately, it just makes it that much more of a struggle to have an informed discussion on the matter without having to do your own extensive research, whereas in the past it was much easier to point to your wife or mother and be able to objectively say \"she doesn't have the right to vote\", or any other such issue. Without such research, a lot of people simply turn to their own morals and confirmation biases, making any \"informed and rational discussion\" on the matter quickly descend into an emotionally charged conflict.  \n\nThe other issue, of course, is trying discuss such things online. For better or worse, the Internet is an anonymous system; which can be empowering for many. It is a tool for the exchange of information and for discussion, but also for the creation of caricatures of ourselves. There are a lot of people who tend towards the extremes in personality while online, being trolls or trying their best to be activists and heroes. The trolls, however, stir up anger and often get much more attention than they deserve, which leads to the problem we have now. There are plenty of misandrists calling themselves feminists to legitimize their matriarchal mindset, and there are likewise plenty of misogynists who identify as MRA to cover up their patriarchal mindset. From this, there are plenty of people who will nitpick details utterly out of context to support their side, or just fabricate information all together. When we come across people like this, making their straw man arguments, it's hard to feel good about either side of the discussion. There are plenty of women who would probably say their views of men have been negatively affected by looking at some Internet forums, and men who would say the same of women. There's the \"feminazi's\" and the \"neckbeards\". Then you have so many young people who have grown up with the Internet and are starting to see Reddit threads, Tumblr posts, and dear god the YouTube comment section... what you have is a lot of these really young impressionable people learning about these issues from the most outlandish sources. You get Call of Duty lobbies descending into teens and younger slinging racial, homophobic, and sexist slurs across shitty microphones because they haven't been raised any better. Even on the more subtle level, there's a double standard, where men are called \"pigs\" for liking a woman in a skimpy cosplay or in swim attire by the same kind of women who see no issue in walking out of a Hollister with the desaturated pictures of toned shirtless men adorning their bags. There's the meme I think we've all seen circle around of the thin man and fat woman, and the fat woman and thin man, where the heavy woman is empowered to defy societal views of beauty and health but the man is criticized for not being in the same league as the woman. Whether or not these sorts of contradictions transcend into everyday life and our interactions is of course hard to see, but even an exaggerated caricature of reality has some basis in truth.\n\nTrying to have an informed conversation in the midst of that becomes very difficult. Personally, I'd like to see everyone equal, but I will admit I'm jaded by all the hatred of men I see in memes, and often it seems that \"not all men are like that\" isn't a legitimate way to express one's disdain for the picture being painted of their own gender. Sometimes it makes me ashamed to have happened to be born with a penis... and I sometimes feel like people see me as a potential rapist, paedophile, or wife beater by default... which isn't right. There are always going to be bastards and bitches who misrepresent their gender, and humanity as a whole. But there are plenty of people who sit firmly in the middle, too tired to bother any more. That's about where I am. I find myself getting upset any time I see something \"feminist\", or hear someone describe themselves as such, because I'm of the expectation at this point that it's really going to be some hateful troll trying to rally women against men. And then you try to bring up men's issues such as the likelihood for a court to decide in favour of a woman in cases of child support, divorce, accused rape... and it gets dismissed as being sexist.

Unfortunately, it just makes it that much more of a struggle to have an informed discussion on the matter without having to do your own extensive research, whereas in the past it was much easier to point to your wife or mother and be able to objectively say \"she doesn't have the right to vote\", or any other such issue. Without such research, a lot of people simply turn to their own morals and confirmation biases, making any \"informed and rational discussion\" on the matter quickly descend into an emotionally charged conflict.  \n\nThe other issue, of course, is trying discuss such things online. For better or worse, the Internet is an anonymous system; which can be empowering for many. It is a tool for the exchange of information and for discussion, but also for the creation of caricatures of ourselves. There are a lot of people who tend towards the extremes in personality while online, being trolls or trying their best to be activists and heroes. The trolls, however, stir up anger and often get much more attention than they deserve, which leads to the problem we have now. There are plenty of misandrists calling themselves feminists to legitimize their matriarchal mindset, and there are likewise plenty of misogynists who identify as MRA to cover up their patriarchal mindset. From this, there are plenty of people who will nitpick details utterly out of context to support their side, or just fabricate information all together. When we come across people like this, making their straw man arguments, it's hard to feel good about either side of the discussion. There are plenty of women who would probably say their views of men have been negatively affected by looking at some Internet forums, and men who would say the same of women. There's the \"feminazi's\" and the \"neckbeards\". Then you have so many young people who have grown up with the Internet and are starting to see Reddit threads, Tumblr posts, and dear god the YouTube comment section... what you have is a lot of these really young impressionable people learning about these issues from the most outlandish sources. You get Call of Duty lobbies descending into teens and younger slinging racial, homophobic, and sexist slurs across shitty microphones because they haven't been raised any better. Even on the more subtle level, there's a double standard, where men are called \"pigs\" for liking a woman in a skimpy cosplay or in swim attire by the same kind of women who see no issue in walking out of a Hollister with the desaturated pictures of toned shirtless men adorning their bags. There's the meme I think we've all seen circle around of the thin man and fat woman, and the fat woman and thin man, where the heavy woman is empowered to defy societal views of beauty and health but the man is criticized for not being in the same league as the woman. Whether or not these sorts of contradictions transcend into everyday life and our interactions is of course hard to see, but even an exaggerated caricature of reality has some basis in truth.\n\nTrying to have an informed conversation in the midst of that becomes very difficult. Personally, I'd like to see everyone equal, but I will admit I'm jaded by all the hatred of men I see in memes, and often it seems that \"not all men are like that\" isn't a legitimate way to express one's disdain for the picture being painted of their own gender. Sometimes it makes me ashamed to have happened to be born with a penis... and I sometimes feel like people see me as a potential rapist, paedophile, or wife beater by default... which isn't right. There are always going to be bastards and bitches who misrepresent their gender, and humanity as a whole. But there are plenty of people who sit firmly in the middle, too tired to bother any more. That's about where I am. I find myself getting upset any time I see something \"feminist\", or hear someone describe themselves as such, because I'm of the expectation at this point that it's really going to be some hateful troll trying to rally women against men. And then you try to bring up men's issues such as the likelihood for a court to decide in favour of a woman in cases of child support, divorce, accused rape... and it gets dismissed as being sexist. So really, there's just a lot of animosity all around which has made everyone too exhausted to want to fight it any more. We're progressing as a society, but sometimes it feels like it's just too exacerbating. \n\n**TL;DR - There's a legitimate discussion to be had, but between all the trolls and Internet excess, I think most of us are too jaded and tired to bother any more and default to being upset any time we see a gender issue post.**"}, {"id": "cm5xe1p", "body": "I see it as aspects of American culture imploding on each other.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Values_Survey#mediaviewer/File:Inglehart_Values_Map2.svg look in the bottom right corner.\n\nBasically one one hand individualism, pursuit of individual happiness and status, both that of men and that of women. \n\nOn the other hand a sense of conservatism, but not the post-Soviet type survivalist conservatism but the more religious-traditionalist kind.\n\nThis is typically the most explosive mix ever.\n\nObviously when both are high or both are low  that goes well together.\n\nThe opposite case, the post-soviet survivalist conservatism coupled with secular-rational values is also fairly explosive, but more reconcilable.

thinking any ideological group i belong with dumb. i just find it humorous when people say something is dumb but also contend to be completely neutral about it.\n\nphrased another way, if you think a paradigm is stupid/dumb, you aren't entering the discussion from a neutral point of view. so that side first has to get you to be aware of how they/we frame it. making sure you are aware that you are disposed or biased toward one side due to a specific remark helps us reconcile to a neutral position even if a different bias can't suggest that our position is better than neutral.\n\nin your original post, you mentioned that people who are biased toward a specific topic are dumb. it is a fair criticism, journalism isn't an easy thing to break down and replace with machines. i've been trying for a week and there are at least 2 problems left- likely more.\n\n...\n\nso you don't think patriarchy is an important idea. fair enough. as a nonfeminist, i don't think it is particularly important either. \n\n...\n\ni'm trying to be short but i'm touching on too much. so i have to delete and start over. 3rd draft :)\n\none of the problems with people who are true neutral, is scapegoating of radicals. basicly people who don't want to face the possibility of being wrong, say that a point argued against them is actually relevant to straw fems, or to the radical crazies.\n\nanother problem is normal compared to disinterested. cultural normal is very feministic. but true normal which doesn't presume any part of feminsim is far to the right of it. to to the political binary, this leads to people who are normal and left thinking true disinterest isn't neutral but right-wing. because in their perspective it is relative to them.\n\nbut it isn't about feminist ideas specificly, but a semi-moderate dodging comments by attributing them to others, while having a worldview which makes no sense without the perception. and because of this even if you convince the person they are wrong, the next day they think they won or are otherwise back to the former paradigm.\n\nif i was to disprove kryarchy, tomorrow there would be a nuanced patch to it by the same author, which misses the bulk of the criticism.\n\nwhich leads us to another thing. there are different ideological paradigms, people just use the electoral right left one. what seems like a radical minority in the electoral group might have nothign to do with the rest. for example the libertarians and tea party want vert small government, while republicans- not so much. it could be argued then that we get the best results if we parse out distinct ideologies and talk purely in their terms instead of the right left thing. that isn't enough to compel most people but i hope it compells you.\n\nnext we have prescriptive opinions about other's intent. within these ideologies, people make hastey generalizations based on premise about the topic. i did this when i mentioned patriarchy cause i honestly didn't think you could call yourself a feminist without thinking men collude together in some insane manner. my favorite version of patriarchy was \"golf resorts\", apparently men all gather secretly some day on a golf course to conspire against women. later it was figured out that feminists were projecting this premise of chauvenism because women are chauvenistic. but even now, with some actually decent science out, there seem to be a large portion of people who believe this. i'm not sure where arguments like \"teach men not to rape\" are coming from without patriarchy or the premise that men are presently teaching rape techniques behind closed doors, but feel free to inform me. i really don't know.  bluntly, because no feminst science has so far seemed vallid, i have no idea how the pieces are supposed to fit together.\n\ni'd apologise for makign the generalizaiton, but i can't honestly do it cause i don't comprehend any mistake.\n\nback to the ideological thing, there is axioms within the ideology which you have to presume for each of these to be fully coherent. something like \"women are oppressed\". and while most of these ideas aren't universally held by the plurality of the ideology, they do seem to come from the most radical/adamant. and the reasoning does seem to trickle down. \n\nlastly ideological wars, (because length) ideologies argue around one another because they don't share axioms. i might like empiracism as an axiom, someone else might like the damsel in distress trope. this inherently leads to different methods of qualifying arguments. with the # gamer that is exactly what was dissonant. there was distrust of the harrassed women, because they didn't seem honest about anything else establishing an empiracle precedent. and inversely, the women seem to not think it is about gaming journalsm because they can't profit/damsel from that. this was why instead of talking remotely about games, the journalists in the mainstream talked about the group with the more personally compelling story, even though it had nothing to do with their opponent. reporters rebranded the antigamer narative with antigamerg.\n\nwhat about what i suggest seems incorrect?"}, {"id": "cm641cn", "body": "i tried responding to OP directly, but got long in the tooth about specific things. but i think you and i are oppositional enough that we could together present the two sides.\n\nwhy do you say \"that isn't what rad fem is at all\" and then say the same thing, and then say \"those aren't rad fems, just regular feminists\"\n\n&gt;believe that social gender is a caste system which exploits women and must be abolished.\n\n&gt;They recognize ... \"...class ... intersect with patriarchy\"\n\n&gt;radical feminists believe that altering the bodies of trans people is regressive, and that instead gender should simply be abolished.\n\nin your words those are rad fem. you start by saying OP is wrong about

patriarchy, there is a very deep ideological seperation between those who believe there is a patriarchy, and those who don't. very few adults believe in patriarchy, and they seem to not due to the lack of patriarchs, outside of specific family setups. so teen girls can feel their father is overprotective and over authoritative, but that is about it.\n\nbut here is the operative question is even radical feminism an irrelevant minority? or is it as you suggest, a mainstream ideology if not plurality position, with widespread awareness suffecient that it can be conflated with the general opinion at large?\n\nbeyond feminism, is there any reasonable evidence to support the assertion that other minorities are using threats of violence to play into social narratives which work against them?\n\n-signed, what OP considers a dumb person-"}, {"id": "cm6mb09", "body": "&gt; then with the first quote is shirtgate\n\nAs far as I am aware, no one of note who has commented on that guy's

Maybe English is not your first language? I was writing about transgender people. People who were born one gender, and go on to live life as the other gender. Radical feminists think that if we just abolished gender, and there was no such thing as men and women, just people with different shapes, then there would be no such thing as trans people.

They do however believe that there is racist and classist exploitation of men. On this, radical feminists and I agree.\n\n&gt;  very few adults believe in patriarchy\n\nThis is completely false. The existence of patriarchy is practically the only thing that all feminists of all ideological types actually agree on. Hundreds of millions of people believe in (and daily experience) patriarchy.\n\n&gt; but here is the operative question is even radical feminism an irrelevant minority?\n\nRadical feminism is certainly a minority, and since the 80s have been getting more and more irrelevant, as mainstream feminisms have adopted positions vis-a-vis gender that are distinctly at odds with radical feminist ideology.\n\n&gt; beyond feminism, is there any reasonable evidence to support the assertion that other minorities are using threats of violence to play into social narratives which work against them?\n\nI don't understand this question.\n\n"}, {"id": "2mm62w", "body": "I'm a foreigner, and honestly I think I must be missing something.

The right in the USA completely ignores the radical feminists in general. Radical feminism implies atheism and that rules out 80% of Americans right there. As you point out, they represent a tiny fringe of the far left. \n\nA lot of the fights have to do with an academic position adopted by radical feminists in the 1960s called \"tabula rasa\" and the \"nature vs nurture\" debate. \n\n\"Tabula rasa\" means \"blank slate\" and it represents one extreme of the nature vs nurture debate, the extreme of the nurture side. \n\nHow this applies to radical feminism is that radical feminists believe that gender is 100% a social construct and there are no inherently \"male behaviors\" and \"female behaviors\" of any kind. \n\nSo let's fast-forward to 2014. Why is this a big problem now?\n\n1) An increasingly large body of scientific evidence has grown since the 1960s demonstrating that there are biological mental differences between male and female minds and biological structural differences that strongly imply gender differences. Radical feminists tend to simply ignore all this evidence. \n\nThe radical feminists have essentially no evidence to support their views, it's all surveys and opinions. Rather than admit the evidence doesn't support their view, the radical feminists think the standards of evidence should be lowered (or ignored). \n\nShort version: Radical feminists are anti-science. \n\n2) Transgender. Wrapped in the very idea of transgender is that there is \"male behavior\" and \"female behavior\". If nothing is inherently male or female the idea of a male mind trapped in a female body makes no sense because there is no such thing as a \"male\" mind. \n\nBecause of this, radical feminists (if not being hypocrites, which is common) have to say that transgender people are neurotic (they're only *pretending* to feel \"trapped\") and that talk therapy and possibly antipsychotic medications (like antidepressants) are a better route to treat transgender than surgery. \n\nMore importantly, since transgender isn't \"real\", there should be no social acceptance of transgender. These people are just \"acting out\". \n\n3) A lot of current feminist complaints seem a lot closer to demanding privileges than equality. \n\nYou'll hear a lot of concern about why there aren't more women in STEM. That's because those jobs are perceived as being lucrative. You don't hear anyone complaining about why there aren't more women in construction, or why women don't have the same prison sentences as men. \n\n4) The \"rich white feminist\" problem. Almost all of the people complaining are white women, and while white women may or may not be paid 25% less than white men, black men make 600% (six hundred percent) less than white men. \n\nSo while white women may face some discrimination, it's trivial next to what black men face. But the feminists argue that **all** men are privileged more than they are, especially black men. Therefore they can claim someone like Kanye West is \"oppressing women\".\n\n"}, {"id": "2mm62w", "body": "I'm a foreigner, and honestly I think I must be missing something.

Most of the problems radical Feminism seeks to address, labeled under the trendy moniker \"privilege\", are actually issues of class inequality. Even calling it \"privilege\" is a bit of a misnomer, since there are social rights we have given to each other equally. In this way, the issue isn't encapsulated in a social political view framed by gender, it's better framed by class. An example of this might be the fact that Hollaback's video appears to have taken place mostly in Harlem and we mostly see black and Hispanic men in the video who are potentially making sexually advancing comments towards that woman.\n\n2. To the matter of point 1, \"Feminism\" has an implicit audience built right into the name of the movement, that of females or women. It would be similar to saying \"I'm for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I'm part of the Democratic party\". This seems to imply that if you were a Republican you wouldn't have these certain values. We will leave aside a personal disaffect even I have with Republicans and note that although there are differences in the expounded virtues of the two parties, Democrats perhaps more focused on community sensibility while Republicans more focused on individualist sensibility, it would be unfair to say, in principle, they don't both uphold core and shared fundamental beliefs. Not only is the argument of Feminism better framed by social class but even in the name there is a kind of lack of inclusion of another half of the gender discussion. A simple notion of this is why not call the study \"Androgynous Studies\" or \"Egalitarianism\". Even \"Femanism\" would be something. Reddit tends to dislike the Egalitarian statement but I think I've sufficiently shown its cause, given the argument against notions of \"privilege\". Even if there are men and women within Feminism, radical or otherwise, they're not built into the name.\n\nOutside of these two principled notions, there is the simple fact that Feminism is what people believe Feminism is, the same way words change meaning over time or institutions adapt to stay relevant in the public forum. I do sympathize, in some part, the same way I sympathize with reddit or 4chan consistently becoming the face of the Internet performing DDoS attacks and doxxing. The difficulty here is that 1. when you frame the argument as gender instead of class, it's hard to put a strong distance between your cause to bring legislative equality to women in deciding what to do with their bodies and their cause for not wearing shirts with sexy women on them because both are within the framework of gender but I would argue one is a much greater and worthy social injustice to address and 2. it's difficult to dissuade radical feminism from only seeing one side of the argument when it seems implicit in the name.\n\nYou are right, however, that every social movement has this, an impassioned group who have scaled down the rhetoric to be simpler, more palatable, and more passionate. That's what gives it popularized traction and makes it come out to the forefront. The shouting matches that occur are because the two reductive and opposing positions cannot resolve because they are not nuanced, which is why they were adopted by people in the first place.

Changing this would require extensive genetic engineering, which is currently not possible (and probably not desirable). \n\nThis view is in no way at odds with the concept of \"women's rights\".

Then another 30 years goes by and somebody on an isolated island who wasn't even born yet when I did my work starts working on 2+2=? and determines that 2+2=5.  Then they go all over the world trying to convince people, no 2+2=5.  Should everyone in the world have an equal dialog with this guy, or should they just tell him that the problem was already solved and that guy is wrong?  Is it worth wasting the time of every single person in the world so that we can say we had a fair and equitable dialog again? Or was the first fair and equitable dialog good enough? I recognize that an MRA might be able to come up with a new and novel argument, and in those cases, yeah, a dialog is actually warranted. But coming up with the same old arguments over and over again just isn't going to cut it.\n\n&gt;Also, how exactly do you expect people who think rape is wrong to accept a definition that includes things they don't already consider wrong and therefore wouldn't do? \n\nWell, to be perfectly frank, I don't think that most people think particularly deeply about most issues.  I know I don't.  I would assume that most people don't have a hard and fast definition in their heads for every single term in the English language. I know that there are activities that I judge broadly as immoral that I've partaken in because I didn't realize that my actions would be grouped in with those activities. The classic example I would give is when someone is being a bully without realizing it, which happens more often that I think most people are aware. Beyond that, there is quite a bit of taboo around rape in the U.S. and most people don't like to think about things that are taboo. \n\nAdditionally, that's how society and laws work.  There are certain things that some people consider murder and other people don't consider murder, and then some people just haven't thought about every available scenario very deeply.  That last group, I would guess, is most people, because most people just don't get in those situations or ever have to worry about them.

I know I don't.  I would assume that most people don't have a hard and fast definition in their heads for every single term in the English language. I know that there are activities that I judge broadly as immoral that I've partaken in because I didn't realize that my actions would be grouped in with those activities. The classic example I would give is when someone is being a bully without realizing it, which happens more often that I think most people are aware. Beyond that, there is quite a bit of taboo around rape in the U.S. and most people don't like to think about things that are taboo. \n\nAdditionally, that's how society and laws work.  There are certain things that some people consider murder and other people don't consider murder, and then some people just haven't thought about every available scenario very deeply.  That last group, I would guess, is most people, because most people just don't get in those situations or ever have to worry about them. "}, {"id": "cm6oetc", "body": "&gt;  I do find it frustrating when someone insists that having sex with a women who is blackout drunk isn't rape\n\nIt's literally impossible, by any known test, to determine of someone is \"blackout drunk\" or just \"drunk\". There is no distinctive behaviors, nothing. It's possible to be \"blackout drunk\" and appear completely stone sober to everyone around you. \n \nSo yes, the \"blackout drunk\" person is *always* responsible because the other party can't tell. It's completely unreasonable to expect people to carry a breathalyzer around. \n\n&gt;  I think the issue here is that MRAs who think that feminists want to shove certain ideas down their throats also assume that feminists haven't heard those MRAs' arguments before.\n\nRemember that MRAs are on the far left (in USA politics), they support women's rights, etc. We're talking about a group even smaller than the feminists. \n\nThe vast majority of men in the USA are completely dismissive of the \"radical feminist\" point of view because they believe in God, and the Bible makes it pretty clear men are supposed to be in charge. That's why the majority of women reject it as well. \n\n&gt; It's not so much that feminists don't want to have a dialog, its that a lot of the dialog coming from the other side isn't new or enlightening.\n\nTough. Talk to a fundamentalist Christian sometimes. If you want to change someone's opinion you have to work with where they're coming from. \n\nThis means, in the USA, you need to show how the Bible and Jesus supports radical feminism.\n"}, {"id": "cm6d9yn", "body": "&gt;I'm going to call BS on that one. Feminists don't want a dialog on this matter, they want everyone to accept their definition and stop talking about it.\n\nAs a feminist, I disagree.  I do find it frustrating when someone insists that having sex with a women who is blackout drunk isn't rape, for instance, but I'm able to understand their position (\"well, what if I'm drunk too, etc.\").  I think the issue here is that MRAs who think that feminists want to shove certain ideas down their throats also assume that feminists haven't heard those MRAs' arguments before. Conversely, I (perhaps unfairly) think that most MRAs who are truly dismissive aren't really giving the feminist point of view a fair analysis. It's not so much that feminists don't want to have a dialog, its that a lot of the dialog coming from the other side isn't new or enlightening.  Then, because the feminists have already considered those ideas and rejected them prior to the discussion of the moment, MRAs accuse the feminists themselves of being dismissive. In particular, I think that this is why female MRAs and male feminists are exceptionally important to the dialog, because their positions on gender based \"moral\" questions are less prone to incentive bias. Then, of course, there are simply differences in values that may or may not be reconcilable.\n\nEDIT: To give an \"example\" of what I'm talking about.  Let's say that, for some reason, everyone thinks 2+2=5.  Then I spend several months thinking about the problem and realize, no 2+2=4.  Then I spend 30 years going all over the world, explaining this amazing new math concept to everyone until everyone believes and understands how and why 2+2=4, not 5.  Then another 30 years goes by and somebody on an isolated island who wasn't even born yet when I did my work starts working on 2+2=? and determines that 2+2=5.  Then they go all over the world trying to convince people, no 2+2=5.  Should everyone in the world have an equal dialog with this guy, or should they just tell him that the problem was already solved and that guy is wrong?

This does happen and is currently treated as the man raping the woman, despite her initiating and without regard to his wishes.\n\n&gt; Is it worth wasting the time of every single person in the world so that we can say we had a fair and equitable dialog again?\n\nOne of the primary contentions of the MRAs is that there never was a fair and equitable dialog.

There was a dialog, but it only really included one side.\n\n&gt; Or was the first fair and equitable dialog good enough?\n\nYou have ~20% support and ~10% opposition. Yeah, it wasn't good enough.\n\n&gt; That last group, I would guess, is most people, because most people just don't get in those situations or ever have to worry about them.\n\nAnd you just proved that your argument about people not caring is completely spurious. The people who don't think about these things don't do so because they don't operate in the gray areas.

The market caters to the consumer. If the consumer doesn't like it, the market stops. \n\nIndicating that the person I was responding to took the position that markets are able to make moral value judgements on the products they sell. But supply and demand doesn't make moral judgements. That something is popular doesn't imply that it's a moral good. There was, after all, a huge market for slaves. There was also a huge market for gladiatorial combat. Neither one of those situations are morally permissible regardless of their market value or that they were popular. \n\nIn other words, my argument isn't that Sarkeesian is right or that video games are \"bad\", only that dismissing those arguments on the basis of markets is horribly misconstrued. \n\nSpecifically with regards to your statement, the argument of \"thought policing\", when looked at beyond a superficial level, rings exceptionally hollow. Criticism of ideas, industries, peoples, or products is not at all thought policing, but an enactment of our right to free speech and free expression. Game manufacturers are completely free make games that depict whatever they want. They are not, however, free from criticism - social or otherwise. Welcome to free speech.\n\n&gt;It is the difference between racists being allowed to be racists and racists being allowed to go out and do bad things to the people they don't like that I'm getting at.\n\nThe idea that we can't publicly criticize racism is ridiculous. People are free to hold whatever views they want. What they aren't is free from criticism for holding those ideas. The bar for criticism isn't set at directly harming other people. I, and society at large, have just as much a right to call out racism as racists have with holding those thoughts. In a free speech society *no one* is above criticism. That's essentially the idea behind \"thought policing\". If gamers are beyond reproach, or the media is beyond criticism because \"the market\", or critics are being silenced in one way or another - that's a form of thought policing. But mere criticism is not as the ability to criticize anything is an essential component for free speech and generally why we think thought policing is wrong.\n\n&gt;I'm simply pointing out that it is, not advocating silencing the criticism.\n\n&gt;Free speech is a strange devil to defend.\n\nIf criticism is thought policing, then free speech is thought policing because the main reason *why* free speech is important is for launching criticisms at bad ideas.

It's much easier and safer for an employer to be able to claim them as normal employees and pay all the normal taxes and pretend they were duped with false paperwork when they get caught than it is for them to try to operate entirely under the table.  Running a decent sized business of any sort with an all cash under the table untaxed workforce is a great way to get fucked, while letting immigrants use fake documents and still paying all the relevant taxes shields the employer from an immigration raid turning into a major IRS lawsuit.  Only the workers don't file taxes, so they don't get refunds back if too much is withheld (and it usually is) and they'll never see a dime of the social security they pay for.  \n\nhttp://www.americanbar.org/publications/tax_lawyer_home/immigrants.html\n\nHere's a treatment of the subject by the american bar.

It's possible for both people in a couple to get very different things out of the same act. A prominent, if extreme, example is that of a D/S power exchange relationship. A dominant partner shouldn't necessarily be willing to sub for their sub. They should, however, be able to go the extra mile in the same way.\n\nIn short if a man wants to get anal he should be ready, willing, and able to go similarly outside their comfort zone and put in an exceptional effort for their partner in some way. Willingness to go an extra mile and try new things at the request of your partner is one of those things that correlates with a healthy relationship, but while we call the act the same thing it is not equivalent. I would argue that each partner should be willing to try something equivalent and outside their comfort zone, but I would disagree that oral must necessarily be traded for oral and anal is a must for anal.\n\nOf course, I am thoroughly unqualified to postulate what the female-on-male equivalency of anal is.

That said, it's not really relevant to my counter-argument.\n\nYou're treating sex like a zero sum game. That for a man to have pleasure in anal sex, the woman would not be achieving any pleasure herself. This is not how sex works in general although it could work that way for an individual couple.\n\nYou are ignoring other possibilities in your point of view. For the purposes of clarity, I'm going to only be speaking of a heterosexual couple. In this paring alone you have these possibilities with anal sex. Desired by man but merely endured by woman, desired by woman but merely endured by man, desired by either and enjoyed by both.\n\nReciprocation is pillar of a good relationship, but reciprocation doesn't need to take the form of the same sex act. It merely should involve something that gives the partner as much pleasure.\n\nFor example. I've dated a woman who LOVE giving blowjobs. She derive pleasure from doing it. The act caused her to physically get wet in anticipation. This same woman was extremely self-conscious about her vagina and often refused cunnilingus. Instead, reciprocation for her was to tickle her back lightly.\n\nMen and women have different perspectives about sex. These extend to what they find sexually arousing, what gives them pleasure and what kinds of things lead to orgasm. We are not the same in this and it's more than an emotional or sociological distinction. It doesn't make sense that men should be open to penetrative sex simply because they derive pleasure from penetrating their partner.\n\nIdeally, the goal in a sexual relationship is for two people to attempt to pleasure the other in any way which they can also derive some pleasure themselves, otherwise sex becomes onerous and not enjoyable.\n\nIf a man wants to anally penetrate his girlfriend/wife, it should only happen if the woman feels she might derive some pleasure from it as well. Separately, if the woman feels she would gain pleasure from pegging her boyfriend/husband, then it should only happen if the man feels he might get off on it too. \n\nAgreeing to be uncomfortably anally penetrated just so you can uncomfortably anally penetrate your partner sounds like really bad sex all around."}, {"id": "2mltpf", "body": "**CMV: if you desire to penetrate your partner anally then you should be willing to receive anal penetration yourself.**\n\n-----------------\n\nMen orgasm from stimulation of their penis.

Heterosexual men who want to penetrate their partner anally should be willing to receive anal penetration from their partner, using fingers at the very least, if not more.\n\nHowever, the premises that preface the OP show a lack of familiarity not only with anal sex, but with both male and female bodies in general. Thus, I believe that using them as a starting point for this discussion will actually be harmful to the goal of influencing people towards the stated view.\n\nHere are some specific points:\n\nResponses to point (1):\n\n* Males *can* orgasm from prostate stimulation, without any penile stimulation whatsoever. I've experienced this. It happens. And it's effing awesome.\n* Females can orgasm from grafenberg-spot stimulation. I haven't experienced this personally due to my anatomy, but I have it on good authority that it happens, and most women I have spoken to about the topic have claimed that it is more pleasurable than clitoral stimulation-induced orgasms.\n* Both sexes can orgasm without any genital stimulation, or even any physical stimulation at all. Admittedly this kind of experience is not all that common, but it is a thing which is certainly not unheard of, especially in alternate communities like the BDSM scene. Let's call this one Psychological Stimulation.\n\nResponses to point (2):\n\n* For some people, their primary erogenous zones actually are not the 'standard' sex organs. I am one of these people. We exist. If you're relying on the premises in the OP and dealing with someone whose primary route to orgasm involves receiving anal penetration, your argument falls apart right here.\n* Get someone hot enough, and it's possible to cause them to orgasm with only stimulation to their secondary erogenous zones. A big part of this is psychological stimulation; See responses to point (1) above.\n* Male and female anuses actually do have one important difference when it comes to penetrative sex: The male anus is the only access point to the prostate, and direct prostate stimulation is known to produce orgasm. The closest equivalent for females is semi-shielded g-spot stimulation via the vaginal wall during penetrative anal sex, which is not the only access to the g-spot, but is certainly still capable of producing orgasm.\n* Orgasm is certainly **NOT** the end-all and be-all of sex. Sure, they can feel good. But there are many kinds of orgasm, not all of which are physically and psychologically enjoyable experiences for everyone, and sometimes the continued anticipation which comes from resisting orgasm is preferable to a 'premature' orgasm.\n\nLastly, while this is another point in response to OP premise (2), it is important enough that I feel it deserves its own paragraph.\n\n* Orgasm is often seen as the 'natural goal' of sex, usually by men who assume the schema portrayed by hardcore porn is an accurate reflection of the dynamics of real sexual intimacy, and consequently whose only interest with regards to sex is getting themselves off. Just to clarify, this is *not* sex, this is *assisted masturbation*. Sex is about sharing intimacy with another feeling person, so it necessarily involves time, patience, and at least a reasonable degree of reciprocation (of the kind that your partner(s) enjoy).\n\n**If you view orgasm as the main reason for having sex with someone, you are doing it wrong.**\n\nResponse to point 3)\nI agree that the mainstream idea of heterosexual anal sex involves male-in-female penetration. As someone who freely admits that I'm atypical when it comes to sex, I'd like to point out that if I am going to penetrate a woman anally during sex, I am going to do everything I can to make it a wildly enjoyable experience for her.\n\nThat said, there does seem to be a view among some 'men' that anal sex is something women *submit to in order to please the male* during sex, and not something that should be enjoyed in its own right. From that perspective, it makes sense that many of these 'men' would resist the idea of being penetrated anally, and I am fairly sure that it is these 'men' that the OP is aimed at.\n\nIn light of that view, I suggest that the core issue here lies not in the fact that there are men who simply are not willing to have things in their butts. It lies in the fact that these men view sex as an act which is supposed to be *enjoyed by men* but *not by women*, and it is *this* view which is what really needs to be changed.\n\nEdit: Formatting.
