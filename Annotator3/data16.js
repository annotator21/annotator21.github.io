That said, I actually think it would be impossible to even house all of the convicts, much less process them through the courts, in a world where every law is strictly enforced and all evidence is videotaped.

For a system to record an entire shift, it will have to meet the following standards:\n\na.\tArmored like a truck. Seriously. Body cameras will take just as much abuse as everything else an officer carries, and they have to be reliable.\n\nb.\tLightweight. Officers today already carry 25+ lbs of gear. Any significant addition of weight runs the risk of elimination via OSHA lawsuit.\n\nc.\tDependable. This goes along with armored, but more to the electronics side. They can\u2019t fail. And if you think that this is an easy task, you need to think about the situations that officers encounter. They will have to work in snowstorms, at 30 below, in sandstorms, at 110, in driving rain, etc.\n\nd.\tBattery life. Some departments work 8\u2019s, some work 10\u2019s, and some work 12\u2019s. And all of them have overtime at the end of a shift. So, to be safe, you\u2019ve got to have 14 hours of battery life, minimum.\n\ne.\tStorage space. You\u2019re going to have to have at least as much storage space as you have battery life. So, if you\u2019ve got 14 hours of battery life, that means (assuming recording at SD [640x480, 30fps]} you need 1 MB/s, or 3.6 GB/hr, or 50.4 GB worth of space. To account for other things that have to live on that drive, call it 55 GB. And that\u2019s for standard definition. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n(2)\tNow, let\u2019s talk about cost. This is a complex discussion, because we have to address the initial startup costs as well as the ongoing maintenance costs. For the purposes of this discussion, let\u2019s use the standard police department for a medium-sized city (100K citizens). This means you've got about 200 officers that work patrol, with 40 on duty at any given time. \n\nWe've already established that the product that\u2019s necessary doesn\u2019t exist on the market today, but let\u2019s pretend it does. The going rate, at the moment, for the product that matches the ideal product is about $1,000, assuming you\u2019re buying in bulk. To equip this department with sufficient cameras, you\u2019re going to have to buy at least 60. Gotta have spares. So that\u2019s $60K. Now, you have to buy all the other stuff that goes along with the cameras. Batteries, replacement storage, mounts, hardware, etc. Call that another $30K. \n\nNow you have to get the service contracts on the cameras, so that when they break, someone will fix them and get them back to you. They\u2019re more than the cost of the cameras, but we\u2019ll pretend they\u2019re the same cost, so that\u2019s another $60K.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve bought a bunch of cameras and the stuff we need to make them work, and spent $150K. \n\nWhat else? \n\nNow we need to talk about software. Specifically, evidence management software. And hardware, because we have to store all that video somewhere, right? So, let\u2019s size some hardware. \n\nAssuming that you have 80 officers work per day, at 50 GB/officer/day, you\u2019re amassing video at a rate of 4 TB per day, or 120 TB per month. Depending on the department\u2019s policies, and the court\u2019s requirements, this evidence has to be stored for a defined amount of time. The shortest policy I\u2019ve ever seen is 3 months, and industry standard seems to be about 2 years. Some departments store for 5.\n\nSo, going with the industry standard of 2 years, you\u2019ve got 2.9 PB of data to store. Now, I don\u2019t work in IT, but my brother does, so I called him. Admittedly, he\u2019s an exec, but he farmed out this question for me. He came back with 21 4U servers, 144TB/server, RAID 6, with an acquisition cost of $1.6MM. For just the hardware. Not to mention the costs of racks, power, etc. Or service.\n\nSo, taking those things into account, you\u2019re now spending $2MM on your storage array. But it has to be redundant, so you have a tape system offsite that will run you another $250K to back it all up. So you\u2019re at $2.25MM for the hardware and software for your hardware. \n\nNow we have to add the costs of the evidence management system. That\u2019s going to run you $50K or so a year. So we\u2019re at $2.3MM for your hardware and software solution.\n\nThis ignores all the other infrastructure to make this system work: networking, wiring, docking cradles, access systems, etc. Call that another $200K.\n\nSo, now we\u2019ve got stuff, we have to add people to run it all. Figure an addition 0.5 FTE to run the arrays, and 3 FTE for the EMS (storing, archiving, recalling, FOIA, prepping evidence, going to court, etc) at $120K a year, you\u2019ve got an ongoing cost of $420K. So, you have to figure that in to your startup costs. So, $2.92MM plus the cost for the cameras, so you\u2019re looking at $3.07MM for first year costs. Ongoing costs are going to be in the $1MM per year range.\n\nSo, let\u2019s compare that against our average department\u2019s budget. This theoretical department is looking at a budget around $20MM per year, so your first year\u2019s costs are 15% of the budget, with ongoing costs around 5%. Given that 95% of a department\u2019s budget goes to personnel costs, this means that there\u2019s literally no way to fund this program without additional taxes.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(3)\tSo, we\u2019ve got cameras and money. Let\u2019s talk policies. There seems to be a belief that because officers carry guns, they are somehow exempt of the protections that are afforded to every other citizen in the United States. I don\u2019t know how to dispel this notion, but let\u2019s just leave alone for the moment that any proposal that requires officers to be videotaped in the bathroom, on the phone, at lunch, etc, will be dead on arrival. There\u2019s no way any union would agree to it, and even if it were forced through by fiat, it\u2019d be overturned by the courts.\n\nMoving beyond that absurdity, we now need to address all the things that officers see and do that would be recorded. They go into people\u2019s homes, cars, businesses, hospital rooms, etc. They interview juveniles, rape victims, assault victims, bystanders, and people not associated with crimes. They see people at their very worst, and everything that they record will have to be available (unless FOIA laws are changed) to the public. This is as true for Joe Citizen as it is for any high-profile citizen or celebrity. \n\nDo we, as a society, want to make this available to anyone with an FOIA request? To youtube? To liveleak? I personally don\u2019t, but that\u2019s my opinion.\n\nMoreover, this gets us into a discussion of the level of surveillance unlike anything we've ever seen. I guarantee that these databases will have facial recognition run on them, which creates a record of every person an officer sees, related to an encounter or not. The FBI has an active system that is in its infancy that will allow this to happen on a country-wide scale. Apparently I\u2019m the only person that finds this a little too far. Even the ACLU has issues with this kind of database. \n\nAll in all, I am a touch tired of hearing from people about how \u201ceasy\u201d a solution this is. You need to look up the term panacea. Memorize the definition. Body cameras are a panacea. \n"}, {"id": "cmdtb2g", "body": "OK, I guess I\u2019m going to write this one long diatribe and save it, rather than just re-writing it every 2 weeks and putting it into yet another body camera thread.\n\nPotential issues with body cameras:\n\n(1)\tFirst, we need to address the fact that, as of today, there isn\u2019t a perfect body camera on the market. For a system to record an entire shift, it will have to meet the following standards:\n\na.\tArmored like a truck. Seriously. Body cameras will take just as much abuse as everything else an officer carries, and they have to be reliable.\n\nb.\tLightweight. Officers today already carry 25+ lbs of gear. Any significant addition of weight runs the risk of elimination via OSHA lawsuit.\n\nc.\tDependable. This goes along with armored, but more to the electronics side. They can\u2019t fail. And if you think that this is an easy task, you need to think about the situations that officers encounter. They will have to work in snowstorms, at 30 below, in sandstorms, at 110, in driving rain, etc.\n\nd.\tBattery life. Some departments work 8\u2019s, some work 10\u2019s, and some work 12\u2019s. And all of them have overtime at the end of a shift. So, to be safe, you\u2019ve got to have 14 hours of battery life, minimum.\n\ne.\tStorage space. You\u2019re going to have to have at least as much storage space as you have battery life. So, if you\u2019ve got 14 hours of battery life, that means (assuming recording at SD [640x480, 30fps]} you need 1 MB/s, or 3.6 GB/hr, or 50.4 GB worth of space. To account for other things that have to live on that drive, call it 55 GB. And that\u2019s for standard definition. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n(2)\tNow, let\u2019s talk about cost. This is a complex discussion, because we have to address the initial startup costs as well as the ongoing maintenance costs. For the purposes of this discussion, let\u2019s use the standard police department for a medium-sized city (100K citizens). This means you've got about 200 officers that work patrol, with 40 on duty at any given time. \n\nWe've already established that the product that\u2019s necessary doesn\u2019t exist on the market today, but let\u2019s pretend it does. The going rate, at the moment, for the product that matches the ideal product is about $1,000, assuming you\u2019re buying in bulk. To equip this department with sufficient cameras, you\u2019re going to have to buy at least 60. Gotta have spares. So that\u2019s $60K. Now, you have to buy all the other stuff that goes along with the cameras. Batteries, replacement storage, mounts, hardware, etc. Call that another $30K. \n\nNow you have to get the service contracts on the cameras, so that when they break, someone will fix them and get them back to you. They\u2019re more than the cost of the cameras, but we\u2019ll pretend they\u2019re the same cost, so that\u2019s another $60K.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve bought a bunch of cameras and the stuff we need to make them work, and spent $150K. \n\nWhat else? \n\nNow we need to talk about software. Specifically, evidence management software. And hardware, because we have to store all that video somewhere, right? So, let\u2019s size some hardware. \n\nAssuming that you have 80 officers work per day, at 50 GB/officer/day, you\u2019re amassing video at a rate of 4 TB per day, or 120 TB per month. Depending on the department\u2019s policies, and the court\u2019s requirements, this evidence has to be stored for a defined amount of time. The shortest policy I\u2019ve ever seen is 3 months, and industry standard seems to be about 2 years. Some departments store for 5.\n\nSo, going with the industry standard of 2 years, you\u2019ve got 2.9 PB of data to store. Now, I don\u2019t work in IT, but my brother does, so I called him. Admittedly, he\u2019s an exec, but he farmed out this question for me. He came back with 21 4U servers, 144TB/server, RAID 6, with an acquisition cost of $1.6MM. For just the hardware. Not to mention the costs of racks, power, etc. Or service.\n\nSo, taking those things into account, you\u2019re now spending $2MM on your storage array. But it has to be redundant, so you have a tape system offsite that will run you another $250K to back it all up. So you\u2019re at $2.25MM for the hardware and software for your hardware. \n\nNow we have to add the costs of the evidence management system. That\u2019s going to run you $50K or so a year. So we\u2019re at $2.3MM for your hardware and software solution.\n\nThis ignores all the other infrastructure to make this system work: networking, wiring, docking cradles, access systems, etc. Call that another $200K.\n\nSo, now we\u2019ve got stuff, we have to add people to run it all. Figure an addition 0.5 FTE to run the arrays, and 3 FTE for the EMS (storing, archiving, recalling, FOIA, prepping evidence, going to court, etc) at $120K a year, you\u2019ve got an ongoing cost of $420K. So, you have to figure that in to your startup costs. So, $2.92MM plus the cost for the cameras, so you\u2019re looking at $3.07MM for first year costs. Ongoing costs are going to be in the $1MM per year range.\n\nSo, let\u2019s compare that against our average department\u2019s budget.

There is a video a girl took from her window after it was all over, but it didn't prove or disprove anything other than somebody was shot outside her window.\n\nShooting that many times isn't exessive if somebody is coming at you and wont stop. The blood trail proves he was coming at the cop. So he either did that to attack him or else the cop said \"come here\" and shot him on purpose. But no witness said the cop told him to come over there. They said he had his hands up and was shot in the back which was proven untrue. He was shot in the front with his hands down.\n\nBrown's friend said he didn't get off the road when the cop told them to because \"We're not his kids.\" so this happened because they wouldn't listen to the cop.\n\nAnd true the cop could be corrupt and bad. But in this case they purposely didn't listen to the cop because they didn't want the cop telling them what to do ... even though they were walking in the middle of the road and traffic had to go around them. DNA shows his hands on the cops gun and a video shows he got violent with somebody just before this ... so for me .. even if the cop is a racist jerk .. Mr. Brown brought this on himself by not listening to the cop, then going for his gun, then going towards him. There is a video of an interview with somebody in the background saying how Mr. Brown was going towards the cop even though he was being shot. Race does not matter if you are going towards somebody and they are shooting at you so that you'll stop. Just stop. Or listen to the police instead of thinking \"You're not my dad. You can't tell me what to do.\" \n\nMr. Browns mother attacked and robbed people selling \"Support Michael Brown\" t-shirts and the step dad yelled to burn this place down. The cop's mother died a long time ago, but while alive she swindled people out of money an the cop himself was on a racist police force that was so terrible everybody was fired and they hired all new people (thought it doesn't mean he was racist ... you don't know how a job will be until you get there.. but he could be racist) Anyway because of all this I think it's likely that the cop wasn't the best guy in the world, but Mr. Brown's upbringing caused him to behave in a way that would get anybody shot regardless of color.

He was a previously a member of a police department [that was so endemically at odds with the local black community that everybody on the force was fired](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/darren-wilsons-first-job-was-on-a-troubled-police-force-disbanded-by-authorities/2014/08/23/1ac796f0-2a45-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html). \n\nSo while I would agree that technically, we can never know *exactly* why the events transpired the way it did, I would strongly argue against the idea that pointing out the racial dynamics of Ferguson and the Michael Brown situation specifically is a \"cop-out\".  There are clear racial tensions in the area, and a history of racialized police brutality.

Many attitudes that were taken for granted in the past are now seen as shocking to our modern standards.\n\nSince I had a rather multicultural upbringing, I'll give you my own anecdotal example of what can be possible when you grow up with multiculturalism being the norm, or without harmful stereotypes drilled into you.\n\nI was fortunate to grow up going to a very diverse private school, where there were many races represented.  Since this started from a very young age, I saw nothing strange about being surrounded by a mix of very different people all around me.  My immediate circle of friends was similarly diverse, and so were the types of guys I got crushes on. (fast-forwarding to the present day, I'm now in an inter-racial marriage)\n\nNot only that, these children of different races weren't usually self-segregating into their own cliques, or seen as different groups within the school.  Since this was a fairly prestigious private school, there was no stigma about minorities being from the wrong side of town, or only getting in through affirmative action or something, because the kids there were all very smart.  I never dreamed of looking at someone of a different race and thinking something like \"hmph, they don't really deserve to be here\", or \"haha, their family's POOR what ghetto losers\" since many of them came from well-off families, and many were much better students than me.  If anything, I saw myself as fairly inferior.  But not because of any white reverse racism - just normal personal issues with shyness, and not being too popular.\n\nI stayed at this school all the way up through high school, and was shocked to come out of my bubble and see how differently so many people saw others of a different race.  I wasn't completely unaware of racism, since we'd certainly studied historical examples of it, but I only saw it in an academic way.  I saw it as something so *obviously* stupid and wrong for the present day, that I didn't realize how awful and widespread it still was.\n\nSo I know, from my experience, that multiculturalism is possible.  But you need to actually be involved and experience it for yourself.  You can't just be brought up in your own little clique where the other races are still the \"other\", and just... out there somewhere for you to eventually bump into.\n\nI hope that someday more people can be brought up to take multiculturalism for granted as much as I did."}, {"id": "2nejw6", "body": "Humans have existed for tens of thousands of years before forming the first semblances of civilization.

The prosecutor himself admitted during the case that a lot of witnesses changed their stories multiple times, usually after being contacted by the media. \n\nThe media also helped to incite these riots the first time.

I will respond to people as I find time. But I wanted to say in response to people telling me that nothing is certain and you can't know the facts, or the facts are determined by the trial, and hence the legal system. That isn't true. In the ferguson case for example, there were several facts right away. The guy was shot, and he ended up dead. There may, or may not, have been a confrontation between him and the police officer. If there was one it was uncertain who started it. He had just robed a store. etc... They are vague, and don't tell you much of anything. But they are true, and, more importantly, they don't bias the report on the case in any way. If you tell people that the police officer may have started the confrontation then you are biasing them to think it was nothing more than racial profiling and police brutality. If you tell your viewers that the kid started the confrontation, then you are being biased to think the police officer was in the right. By simply stating what happened, and not who did what, you keep the facts and leave the bias.\n\n**Edit 2** - My view has been changed, though maybe not in such a way that many of you would have liked. I now agree that outright censoring of the news is bad, even if it is for a good reason. In light of that, I think that there should be regulations on the headlines that news medias use. They can put anything they want in their articles, but their headlines should no longer be so outrageous as to bias your view before even reading the article (stuff like \"Racial profiling grows as cop blatantly shoots black kid in Ferguson, MI yesterday\"). Since teh media can still report whatever they want to, it isn't censoring them, but it does help keep from influencing as many opinions as strongly. I also think that privacy of the people trumps freedom of the press (but thats a personal opinion) and, as such, any and all names should not be allowed in the media period until a decision is reached. It would be enough to say that a cop shot a kid after hearing reports of attempted theft. No names need to be involved. By protecting their identities you are helping to keep their lives intact and protecting them from potential retaliation from people who are upset over the outcome of the trial. This would be as simple as not releasing the names to anyone until the investigation is complete and all facts are gathered. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In the ferguson case for example, there were several facts right away. The guy was shot, and he ended up dead. There may, or may not, have been a confrontation between him and the police officer. If there was one it was uncertain who started it. He had just robed a store. etc... They are vague, and don't tell you much of anything. But they are true, and, more importantly, they don't bias the report on the case in any way. If you tell people that the police officer may have started the confrontation then you are biasing them to think it was nothing more than racial profiling and police brutality. If you tell your viewers that the kid started the confrontation, then you are being biased to think the police officer was in the right. By simply stating what happened, and not who did what, you keep the facts and leave the bias.\n\n**Edit 2** - My view has been changed, though maybe not in such a way that many of you would have liked. I now agree that outright censoring of the news is bad, even if it is for a good reason. In light of that, I think that there should be regulations on the headlines that news medias use. They can put anything they want in their articles, but their headlines should no longer be so outrageous as to bias your view before even reading the article (stuff like \"Racial profiling grows as cop blatantly shoots black kid in Ferguson, MI yesterday\"). Since teh media can still report whatever they want to, it isn't censoring them, but it does help keep from influencing as many opinions as strongly. I also think that privacy of the people trumps freedom of the press (but thats a personal opinion) and, as such, any and all names should not be allowed in the media period until a decision is reached. It would be enough to say that a cop shot a kid after hearing reports of attempted theft. No names need to be involved. By protecting their identities you are helping to keep their lives intact and protecting them from potential retaliation from people who are upset over the outcome of the trial.

The media also covers what people are saying second hand, like taping a community leader who is talking to a crowd and saying \"I talked to people about what happened and this is what happened.\" Both are news worthy because they're happening and perspectives on the situation, but they can't be proven or disproven. Many events that happen when humans interact don't have a lot of completely hard facts associated with them unless they're recorded. In ferguson, a man was found dead at a location and a cop shot that man and killed him. That's pretty much all you can definitively say, everything else has the flaws of humans and their memory.

But they are true, and, more importantly, they don't bias the report on the case in any way. If you tell people that the police officer may have started the confrontation then you are biasing them to think it was nothing more than racial profiling and police brutality. If you tell your viewers that the kid started the confrontation, then you are being biased to think the police officer was in the right. By simply stating what happened, and not who did what, you keep the facts and leave the bias.\n\n**Edit 2** - My view has been changed, though maybe not in such a way that many of you would have liked. I now agree that outright censoring of the news is bad, even if it is for a good reason. In light of that, I think that there should be regulations on the headlines that news medias use. They can put anything they want in their articles, but their headlines should no longer be so outrageous as to bias your view before even reading the article (stuff like \"Racial profiling grows as cop blatantly shoots black kid in Ferguson, MI yesterday\"). Since teh media can still report whatever they want to, it isn't censoring them, but it does help keep from influencing as many opinions as strongly. I also think that privacy of the people trumps freedom of the press (but thats a personal opinion) and, as such, any and all names should not be allowed in the media period until a decision is reached. It would be enough to say that a cop shot a kid after hearing reports of attempted theft. No names need to be involved. By protecting their identities you are helping to keep their lives intact and protecting them from potential retaliation from people who are upset over the outcome of the trial.

The media have a huge responsibility - they single handedly control what people know and don't know. In my opinion, the media should be subject to as much scrutiny as the judicial system. We have many laws in place to prevent judges from being corrupt and to ensure that the legal system upholds the closest thing to legitimate justice we can hope to achieve. Why isn't this the case for the media?\n\nOne big problem being mentioned here is freedom of the press - a pillar for democracy. Imposing limits to what the media can and cannot say is considered by many to be the beginnings of a very slippery slope that leads to what we see in Russia, worse in China. But I still agree that we accord too much value to freedom of press to the determine of it's integrity. In theory it's a great concept : allow the media to report on anything that is fact, that is truth. In practice, that would be pretty hard to implement.\n\nI initially thought about this when the mayor of my city was accused of gangsterism and had to resign a few days after the media outlets had made a huge deal about it. It was a big deal, but the issue is that anyone can accuse anyone else of anything. He could very well be innocent. But the media outlets made him out to be guilty from the get go. We see this happen in the media all the time. \n\nSo here are solutions that I came up with, which in theory seem to work. In practice, they would be very difficult to implement.\n\nI don't know the political system in the US very well but you would have an independent  board of people elected by different parties of each state. In Canada, the election process would be similar to that of the auditor general. Basically, you want to avoid that these people are elected solely by the government in power and that they be the most politically independent as realistically possible.\n\nThis board would examine news reports from major outlets (say that delivery news to more than one million people) and would issue fines to outlets that have headlines that don't reflect the facts. I think it's good to focus on headlines/ front page news because a lot of people get their info solely from that. These laws would only apply to major news outlets, and would only apply to the front page/ headlines. There could be a limit to the size of words/pictures used on the front page when the story concerns a trial. There would be other regulations concerning other issues. The news outlets could still say whatever they want to say in the body of the article, we would only be limiting what they can say on the front page and headline. This would hopefully limit misguided sensationalist headlines this twist the truth. Plus the fact that the penalty for infringing the law would be a fine, it would still allow for news outlets to make sensationalist headlines but it would limit them to the extent that the can pay the fine.  The fine could increase for repeat offenders. There would be an appeals process so that news outlets could make their case as to whether or not the headline/front page article was indeed dishonest, disingenuous.\n\nI guess what id want is to limit the shocking headlines that twist the truth while still allowing the media to say what they want to say. The media grab peoples attention through big front page pictures with shocking headlines. Let's prevent that, and a good portion of the population won't be believing half-truths. Those that choose and actually read the article can then form an informed opinion - not one based solely on the 5 word title on the front page. \n\n\n"}, {"id": "2ndhkz", "body": "Given that the mainstream media in the US is now entertainment news instead of actual news, I think that when they stop reporting facts on investigations it is bad for the entire country. Just look at Ferguson. Because the media twisted people's opinions by omitting certain facts, and spinning others in a hugely negative light, it is now almost impossible to even know what the hell happened. The prosecutor himself admitted during the case that a lot of witnesses changed their stories multiple times, usually after being contacted by the media. \n\nThe media also helped to incite these riots the first time. They insinuated, long before it was even possible to have all of the facts, that it was nothing more than police brutality and racial profiling. I don't know if it was or wasn't, and I am not here to argue that. But because the media insisted that it was before they could confirm that with facts, citizens across the country, especially in Ferguson, believed it. That helped spark the protests, which, in turn, opened the door to looters taking advantage of the situation and destroying people's lives in the process. \n\nI think that if the media were allowed to only present facts that had been verified, and not make any unsubstantiated claims from those, it would go a long way towards making sure this doesn't happen in the future. We still need to know what is going on, which is why the media should be allowed to report. But, at the same time, we need to know what is going on, not what the media wants us to believe went on.\n\nEdit - I haven't been ignoring this thread, but I have been in class for the past few hours, and I have class again in a few minutes.

You can't dictate what a media outlet does or didn't report.  If the American public wanted intelligent and factual news,  they would turn off 90% of the news reports out there, forcing the market to change how news is reported \n\nDid the media incite the riots? You'd have to prove that.  Already there were crows of upset people and the sense the police weren't going to be able to control things for many hours if a riot did break out.   There have been many theories on who actually did the rioting.   One TV talk show suggested there are groups that benefit from racism fears, and they sent outsiders in to riot.   Another theory is that the protesters remained non violent and it was opportunistic criminals who saw an easy chance for looting.   Until the arrests are processed and inquiries made from this round of looting we can't even say for sure how local the rioters are.\n\nDoes the media make things worse?  We could blame them but who we really need to blame are the Americans who react rather than think.   I feel as if a % of people already leaned towards one side or another and it wouldn't have mattered if an indictment was made.  We already have a polarized country of those who trust the system &amp; law enforcement versus those who feel citizens are victims of an out of control government.    It wouldn't have mattered what the news said.\n\nIf you want to fix something,  censorship isn't it.   What we need to do is to get better at teaching young people much better critical thinking skills.  When they're adults they might then be able to keep an open mind and not believe their favorite TV station blindly.    \n"}, {"id": "2ndhkz", "body": "Given that the mainstream media in the US is now entertainment news instead of actual news, I think that when they stop reporting facts on investigations it is bad for the entire country. Just look at Ferguson. Because the media twisted people's opinions by omitting certain facts, and spinning others in a hugely negative light, it is now almost impossible to even know what the hell happened. The prosecutor himself admitted during the case that a lot of witnesses changed their stories multiple times, usually after being contacted by the media. \n\nThe media also helped to incite these riots the first time. They insinuated, long before it was even possible to have all of the facts, that it was nothing more than police brutality and racial profiling. I don't know if it was or wasn't, and I am not here to argue that. But because the media insisted that it was before they could confirm that with facts, citizens across the country, especially in Ferguson, believed it. That helped spark the protests, which, in turn, opened the door to looters taking advantage of the situation and destroying people's lives in the process. \n\nI think that if the media were allowed to only present facts that had been verified, and not make any unsubstantiated claims from those, it would go a long way towards making sure this doesn't happen in the future. We still need to know what is going on, which is why the media should be allowed to report. But, at the same time, we need to know what is going on, not what the media wants us to believe went on.\n\nEdit - I haven't been ignoring this thread, but I have been in class for the past few hours, and I have class again in a few minutes. I will respond to people as I find time. But I wanted to say in response to people telling me that nothing is certain and you can't know the facts, or the facts are determined by the trial, and hence the legal system. That isn't true. In the ferguson case for example, there were several facts right away. The guy was shot, and he ended up dead. There may, or may not, have been a confrontation between him and the police officer. If there was one it was uncertain who started it. He had just robed a store. etc... They are vague, and don't tell you much of anything. But they are true, and, more importantly, they don't bias the report on the case in any way. If you tell people that the police officer may have started the confrontation then you are biasing them to think it was nothing more than racial profiling and police brutality. If you tell your viewers that the kid started the confrontation, then you are being biased to think the police officer was in the right. By simply stating what happened, and not who did what, you keep the facts and leave the bias.\n\n**Edit 2** - My view has been changed, though maybe not in such a way that many of you would have liked. I now agree that outright censoring of the news is bad, even if it is for a good reason. In light of that, I think that there should be regulations on the headlines that news medias use. They can put anything they want in their articles, but their headlines should no longer be so outrageous as to bias your view before even reading the article (stuff like \"Racial profiling grows as cop blatantly shoots black kid in Ferguson, MI yesterday\"). Since teh media can still report whatever they want to, it isn't censoring them, but it does help keep from influencing as many opinions as strongly. I also think that privacy of the people trumps freedom of the press (but thats a personal opinion) and, as such, any and all names should not be allowed in the media period until a decision is reached. It would be enough to say that a cop shot a kid after hearing reports of attempted theft. No names need to be involved. By protecting their identities you are helping to keep their lives intact and protecting them from potential retaliation from people who are upset over the outcome of the trial. This would be as simple as not releasing the names to anyone until the investigation is complete and all facts are gathered. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
