I used it as a shortcut because it would take a long time to explain what I really meant, and would just get in the way of my point.\n\nWhat I actually meant was something along the lines of this:\n\nThere is a feedback loop between language and cultural identity. While language does not define culture, adherence to a culture may require participation in the common language of that culture. New developments in culture are then expressed in the terms of that language. People who are part of the culture will identify themselves both by language as well as other cultural entities.\n\nAside from inclusively defining their culture, this also serves to distinguish that one from other cultures. While nominal at first, as the population sets themselves apart as belonging to one culture and not another, they form a sort of isolation in which their own developments receive more recognition than those from other cultures, and therefore their perspective becomes unique compared to other cultures. This changes the trajectory of future developments in that culture. As an example, urban youth in the US developed rap; rap culture thus focused on appealing to that demographic, and became large and inextricably tied to it; outsiders largely didn't relate. People in the demographic were attracted to other arbitrary aspects of the culture, like fashion and jargon. So rap was born from the views of inner city youth, but went on to influence those views.\n\nAnd thus, on a larger scale, you have the cultural divisions caused by language. It is said that a language is a dialect with an army and a navy, and this reflects a more essential truth: people can choose to orbit a common center (\"American\") or focus on their divisions (\"the south\", \"the northeast\", \"west coast\", etc.).\n\nSo I used France and Spain as an example. Probably not my best idea as I don't know all that much about their cultural differences. But I suspect if you look at a lot of architecture, music, literature, and so on, you will find things that were done in France *because* they were French, and things that were done in Spain *because* they were Spanish. Small experiments become a cultural identity because they catch on within a portion of the culture and then snowball in popularity as they pass a tipping point. But not everything transcends borders. \n\nStereotypically, I know of Spanish guitar music, and that coffeeshop accordion stuff from France. Why are those so? Why did they not spread quickly and fully between both countries? There is no logistical reason: both countries have the natural resources for the instruments, both have been exposed to the other kind of music for a long time. So the simple fact is, a culture develops in parallel: the music partially defines a culture, and a culture is more accepting of that music because it is \"from that culture\".  Thus we have common centers for each culture, and accordingly there are divisions between cultures.\n\nLanguage is the same. The Roman empire, before its collapse, ruled Gaul and the Iberian. Everyone spoke Latin, because Rome was strong and people wished to participate in their culture. But Rome lost it's grip on outlying territories over time. People were no longer attracted to the Roman culture. They enjoyed expressing a more local culture instead.\n\nThe instigator here is a mountain range, the Pyrenees, which geographically isolated the two areas at first. Still, there was trade and travel. But it was easier to get to the major urban centers on the same side of the mountains; in France, it was fashionable to emulate the people in power in Paris. I don't know as much about Spain, and I know it contains more significant cultural diversity, so I don't think it's as simple as saying \"Madrid\", but the details aren't important. People had found two different cultural loci, which means it was inevitable that the cultures would split. The language split as well. A slang word in French caught on and became the new term; in Spain it didn't happen. And vice versa. In France, a major new speech pattern developed: syllables after the last stressed syllables were dropped. This didn't happen in Spain.\n\nSo you have two languages after a while, no longer mutually intelligible. Eventually transportation matures, and it is easy to travel between the two countries. Radio and television and the internet happen, and it's easier than ever to be exposed to the other culture.\n\nBut they don't merge. They stay distinct. Why? Because they are different. Each culture has its own identity. People value the production in their own culture differently than outside culture. And the language provides a convenient barrier. Lyon and Paris are hardly the same, but if a new word catches on, you'll probably find it in both before long: common culture. It probably won't catch on in Barcelona, though. Because unless it's cool to be French, people won't gravitate towards other culture like that. And this new word makes French and Spanish slightly more different than they were before...So now it's even harder top reconcile them.\n\nThe French and Spanish see each other as being fundamentally different people now. Different foods catch on in each country, different music, different philosophy. Cultural identity alters the trajectory of culture, which then defines the new cultural identity.\n\nFrance and Spain are very different because at one time they were *slightly* different, just different enough to create a self-reinforcing wedge that forced the societies apart.\n\nThis can happen regionally, too, and I'll go back to the US for this. In the northeast, people think southerners are less smart. In the south, people think those in the northeast are rude. Now, at first this is a mere exaggeration. But now people in Massachusetts have \"smart\" as a cultural identity. They value smart, they want to be smart, they want to prove they are smarter. So there's a cultural emphasis on education. They become more educated. In Georgia, they have \"polite\" add a cultural identity. They want to prove it: being polite becomes really important. If you are rude, people get angry--more than they would in New York. So Georgia actually does become more polite.\n\nThe cultural identity has changed the cultural trajectory. And cultural identity affects the current culture, which can be defined by class or location, but often by language as well. Language defines who you can communicate to, which changes what information you receive and pass on. It is a powerful way of defining in and out groups. And once established, further changes are reinforced within each division *because* they are separate, making them *more* separate.\n\nThat's my attempt to expound on what I mean by \"explore different facets of humanity\". There are many things we are capable of, but only some valued by a culture. The more cultures we have, the more things are explored. The more divisions in language we have, the more divisions of culture we have. There are plenty of drawbacks, too. There are many things that can't be explored unless a culture is powerful enough (blue sky science, etc.). Divisions create conflicts and wars. Some cultures value a lack of change and become dead-ends.\n\nSo there's a balance there, and it's not as simple as more culture = better. But it does mean we find new opportunities to be better which may not have come up in all cultures. Early American culture was a stumbling offshoot of Britain, that through initial division changed enough to inspire revolution. Once demonstrated, France was on the road to revolution as well. Why did Americans overthrow the monarchy while Britain did not? It wasn't about taxes; it was that Americans lived a different life. They, out of necessity, created a new culture, because information didn't flow fast enough to keep them tied to British trends. And once they were different, nothing could stop then from becoming steadily more different. Now we have two major dialect branches of the English language. We have different rules for tenses, pluralization, spelling (should that have been pluralisation?), vocabulary, and a wildly different vowel inventory. People know by how they speak which group they belong to, and which they are more likely to follow, always cementing the cultural division which since changed the political face of the world.\n\nMaybe it's good, maybe it's bad, but the impact is undeniable."}, {"id": "2n9vx2", "body": "I was born in America but, due to my mother being Australian, pronounce certain words differently.

However, I have found that it is a strange mix of Australian and American pronunciation (most Americans say I sound either British or Australian, and if they think I sound American, I sound like I'm from the northeast, where I've never lived) . Because of this, I always explain my accent in the context of where I grew up (Missouri) and my mother teaching me to speak\n* I grew up using Australian slang, though I often did not learn it was Australian only until much later in life. I have since, for the most part, stopped using the slang because it requires explaining whole new words. My pronunciation, on the other hand, is inherently a part of my accent, and because I have to explain that just about every time I meet someone, in my mind justifies my pronunciation. \n* I do *not* think that the British pronunciation is any more \"right\" than the American, it was a mistake in my part to say it was original. I did not intend sound uninformed or conceited\n* My peers often go out of their way to correct me in a very specific and individual way. They say that, because I'm American and was raised in America, I should sound American. However, I find they are ignoring not only my obvious accent but also the profound effect my mother has has on not only my speech patterns but also the words I use. I often try to identify as *both* Australian and American, because to me that is what I am. When my pronunciation gets confusing, I will happily switch for the conversation. However, when others cannot seem to understand *why* I sound like that and instead attribute it to me attempting to sound \"different\"  is when I take offense. * In a formal environment, I will adhere to the standard (which is  usually American in nature) because that has a very precise meaning of correct"}, {"id": "cmbp745", "body": "For me, it's irritating to listen to someone who appears to be from the US, speaking with an American accent and using British slang.

I would definitely call it a promising show, but not really a good one. There's some sharp writing and some really funny moments sprinkled throughout the show, but it has one major flaw. Its star can't act. John Mulaney is a first-rate comedian but his idea of acting is basically just doing stand-up while in a scene. The show is full of weird moments where he's just kind of staring off ahead like he's telling jokes to an audience only he can see.\n\nMy guess is that what John Mulaney is learning right now, like a lot of other SNL alums, is that his brand of comedy doesn't transfer seamlessly to other formats.

Before I realized that I was transgender, I'd always picture myself as a man.  When asked what I wanted to be when I'd grow up, I might picture myself as a male cartoonist or a male doctor or a male writer.\n\nDo you feel a bit of anxiety when people describe you with gendered pronouns that are associated with your sex?

When you talk to someone of the same sex, do you feel like you're talking to someone of the opposite sex?\n\nWhen you wear clothing that is typically associated with your sex, even if you enjoy wearing it, does it feel like crossdressing?\n\nI'm going to guess that your answers to all of these will be \"no,\" whereas for me, they're all yeses.\n\nAlso, because this experience is so difficult to put into words, I'd cut your friends some slack.

People who feel like their genders and may never be accepted as such, even if they surpass their cisgender counterparts in most aspects of the system.

Okay, dad jokes aside, let's talk gender *roles*. A gender role is a social construct, absolutely. Men and woman might be slightly more pre-disposed to liking different things but there's nothing in our biology that says 'You're a dude, you must like football' or 'You're a lady, you must like flowers'. So we agree here!\n\nWhere we fundamentally disagree is that trans people reinforce gender roles. Well, to be fair to you, I suppose we do in some ways but what you need to remember is that correlation\u2260causation. Do you know why I fit some masculine stereotypes? I'm a man. That's all there is to it. There's a reason gender roles exist: they're predominant. A lot of people fit gender roles\u2014and that's okay! There's nothing wrong with being comfy in your traditional gender role. The issue stems from people being *forced* to adhere to a gender role. That's where gender roles become problematic, they're not simply problematic because they exist. \n\nLet's look at gender roles from a Psych 101 perspective, shall we? Gender roles are a 'schema': basic bullet points you keep in your brain that condense something complex into something much more manageable for when you need those little snippets of information. So you might say, okay, women like baking and men like playing video games (I personally like both these things, but that's neither here nor there)\u2014there's nothing wrong with that! *Generally*, these groups of people do like these things. Saying that Amy *must* like baking because she's a woman and Bob *must* like video games because he's a man is where the problems arise.\n\nNow, let's talk about you and your identity! How do you describe your own gender identity? How do you describe your inherent femininity (whether you are using its 'traditional' definition or not). It's not easy.

Okay, dad jokes aside, let's talk gender *roles*. A gender role is a social construct, absolutely. Men and woman might be slightly more pre-disposed to liking different things but there's nothing in our biology that says 'You're a dude, you must like football' or 'You're a lady, you must like flowers'. So we agree here!\n\nWhere we fundamentally disagree is that trans people reinforce gender roles. Well, to be fair to you, I suppose we do in some ways but what you need to remember is that correlation\u2260causation. Do you know why I fit some masculine stereotypes? I'm a man. That's all there is to it. There's a reason gender roles exist: they're predominant. A lot of people fit gender roles\u2014and that's okay! There's nothing wrong with being comfy in your traditional gender role. The issue stems from people being *forced* to adhere to a gender role. That's where gender roles become problematic, they're not simply problematic because they exist. \n\nLet's look at gender roles from a Psych 101 perspective, shall we? Gender roles are a 'schema': basic bullet points you keep in your brain that condense something complex into something much more manageable for when you need those little snippets of information. So you might say, okay, women like baking and men like playing video games (I personally like both these things, but that's neither here nor there)\u2014there's nothing wrong with that! *Generally*, these groups of people do like these things. Saying that Amy *must* like baking because she's a woman and Bob *must* like video games because he's a man is where the problems arise.\n\nNow, let's talk about you and your identity! How do you describe your own gender identity? How do you describe your inherent femininity (whether you are using its 'traditional' definition or not). It's not easy. I can tell you that I can't stand my body and that this was only partially fixed when I started taking testosterone. The thing is, you can't identify with that! It's a foreign concept to you. So, I'll tell you: oh, I don't like wearing dresses.

One way of describing it might be as suffering from panic attacks and depression all rolled into one, in various states of intensity throughout our lives. Surgery and hormones lessen this but it never really goes away. You still don't really get that. You might vaguely get it as a concept but your reaction is probably just 'Well, it's silly to have those feelings over your gender, get over it.'\n\nMost people, however, can identify with the simpler things: the gender roles. If I say 'I do all these things that are typically male', that's what makes people think, 'Oh yeah, he's probably a dude'. And it's not at all because of these things that I am trans!

I transitioned from male to female. I didn't transition because of social pressure or social roles. I did it to feel at one with my own body. That's really it. \n\nIt's difficult to describe how gender dysphoria feels if you've never experienced it yourself. It's a deep, inner, skin-crawling sense of \"wrongness\" that your own body makes you feel. It's like, previously, when I looked at my body it just felt wrong on a deep, fundamental level. I lacked certain things, like breasts, and my chest felt \"empty\" without them. Other things, like my groin, felt really off. Shaving made my skin crawl. \n\nIt's ultimately not rational, logical, or something you can explain easily. It's just a deep, inner sense of wrongness about your own physical body. \n\nSometimes cisgender people this to some degree as well. The most common cosmetic surgery for men is actually breast removal. Many men get gynecomastia, and it causes them a similar kind of discomfort. Many women undergo laser hair removal or electrolysis to remove facial hair. \n\nNow, you can waive your hands and say this is all social pressure, but I really don't believe so. \n\nSay I'm a mad philosopher trying to prove a point. I have you abducted, then pumped full of testosterone until you grow a full beard. Then you're dumped on an a remote island all alone. \n\nYou're sitting there, all by yourself, completely free from social pressure, but also have a full beard. Would you suddenly not feel great discomfort from having a huge amount of facial hair? If it's all social pressure, then you should be fine with it right? No other people around means to social pressure. \n\nIn reality you would still feel immense pain and discomfort. Every time you saw your reflection, you would feel a deep sense of wrongness and would feel incredibly violated and abused, and rightfully so. That's a crude analogy to be sure, but perhaps it hints at what trans people feel pre-transition. \n\nAnd, as others have mentioned, trans people don't transition just to conform to stereotypes. I've been living as female for nearly three years. Been on hormone therapy for 3.75. Had gender reassignment surgery, hair removal, etc. Pretty much run the gauntlet as far as trans medical treatments. \n\nDo you know what I wore today? When I was getting ready this morning, I didn't put on a full face of makeup and a ridiculous bright pink dress. I put on a pair of skinny jeans, a set of brown faux leather boots, a green plad collared long-sleeve shirt, and a bra and panties. For makeup, I put on a little foundation and some lipstick. That's it. I don't work at a beauty salon or a street walker. I went to my boring 9-5 engineering job. I actually work in a rather male-dominated field. I'm definitely not living some life that fulfills gender stereotypes. \n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2n9fhx", "body": "I have a hard time following some of my feminist friends, and would be labeled a trans-exclusive feminist for thinking this way.

I don't mean this to say that they are the same thing. But it's clear that, in the US at least, both of them mutually reinforce each other. That's why you just have to peek a kid's genitals in the womb to declare them Man or Woman, and no one bats an eye. Vagina = woman, penis = man, which is also the sort of social systems that lead to intersex kids having cosmetic medical surgeries forced upon them to make them 'fit into' the sexes better. \n\nAll of this is why if you're trying to destroy the constructions of gender, you must *also* cast a critical eye towards how we construct sex. We use physical markers to determine how to socially treat people because, by and large, that's kind of what gender is. The social systems and norms surrounding how to treat people in the different gender categories, with (more or less) your genitals determining membership. The thing is though because in our day-to-day interactions we typically have no way of 'confirming' other people's genders vis a vis sex, gender is more or less a bunch of assumptions we make about other people to determine how to treat them. Retreating to an analysis of 'sex' doesn't actually escape the gender question (because gender is a social manifestation of physical embodiments), it just cloaks those effects and pretends to be more objective and universal than it really is in practice.\n\nSecond, focusing on trans people as some unique threat to this construction is foolishness. Butler's lesson is not that gender is 'socially constructed' which is a bad reduction of her writing, it's that *we all perform it*. That includes cis people. If a trans woman is reinforcing gender by getting SRS, and cis woman who proclaims her femininity through her vagina is doing *the exact same thing*. If gender is just 'horoscope BS', then feminists organizing around women (and MRAs/Masculinists doing it around men) are supporting gender the same way. And that's actually more damaging than anything transgender people do, because unlike cis folk, we don't have any cultural capital.\n\nPeople get this idea that transgender people just listen to/reinforce stereotypes. If *we* say \"I just fit in with the girls better\" it's reason to question our femininity. If a cis woman says it, all the other women in the room just nod their heads and smile. It's a double standard of the worst sort, except trans women get to deal with double the burden because of the pathetic/deceptive tropes. If you think gender is just BS, then you need to tear your gaze away from transgender people who are typically just following the lead of cisgender women/society, and cast it over the ways that cis people create the grounds for all of this in the first place. We just follow the lead that cis people lay down."}, {"id": "2n9fhx", "body": "I have a hard time following some of my feminist friends, and would be labeled a trans-exclusive feminist for thinking this way.

Do you not believe religion exists? Is that a thing that's possible to believe?\n\n&gt;And then, as one example, usually whenever you ask a trans-person how they knew they weren't, say, a male, they say something along the lines of \"I never fit in with the girls growing up\" ('not like other girls' trope) or \"I didn't like wearing makeup\" (gender rolls trope).\n\nWhy is this hypothetical person saying they didn't feel comfortable with *feminine* gender norms when they are explaining why they aren't *a man?*\n\nAlso, this is a really common topic, you may find a lot of good discussion on this topic if you look here: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/gender#wiki_gender_identity"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2n9byk", "body": "More specifically, I support the death penalty provided that the accused is given a fair trial and is proven in court beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the crime (e.g. Committed in broad daylight in front of dozens of people/caught on CCTV with DNA evidence). Also, only for absolutely heinous crimes like murder.\n\nI believe that everyone of us that lives in a society has tacitly agreed to a social contract and to abide by the society's laws. By committing a crime like murder, this contract is broken and the individual has given up the right to live in that particular society. As such, the death penalty seems like the only way to remove the murderer from society and prevent him from threatening the safety of others. Exile seems like an option too, but it is quite clearly no longer a realistic option in today's globalised and interconnected world. \n\nI have read certain arguments saying that the state does not have the right to take another person's life. However, I believe that the state does in fact have this right, since the person has broken the social contract and the state has the duty to protect the safety of others in society. Also, since we have already conceded that the state has the right to restrict the freedom of individuals by putting them in prisons when they commit a crime, I don't see how it is much more of a stretch to say that they similarly have the right to take another person's life when they commit a much more heinous crime.\n\nAlso, while I generally support rehabilitation, I think that it is only appropriate for lesser crimes like drug abuse or assault. A murderer will cause a much bigger threat to society (even after having undergone rehabilitation, there is no guarantee that the individual will not murder again) and I do not think that others that live in the society deserve to be put under this threat.\n\nHence, these are the main reasons why I am in favour of the death penalty. Of course, I am assuming that the accused is mentally sound to make the choice of committing the crime.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But we still have tons of wrongfully convicted inmates in the system. Why? Eye witnesses make mistakes all the time, especially when they are attempting to identify someone of another race. Many of the forensic techniques (hair microscopy, bite mark comparisons, firearm tool mark analysis and shoe print comparisons) have never been subjected to rigorous scientific evaluation and have reliability issues. Some of the forensics scientists make mistakes attempting serology (blood typing), or the information is inaccurately conveyed at trial. We also have problems with false confessions [source](http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/DNA_Exonerations_Nationwide.php).\n\nHell, even when there aren't such problems, you still have issues with the jury.  [Jury members often have formed a conclusion about the case following opening statements](http://www.kkcomcon.com/OJRU/ROJR1208-1.htm), and then essentially only look for evidence to support whichever way they were leaning to begin with, while ignoring or downplaying contradictory evidence--i.e. presentation of the evidence did not change these jurors' judgments made after listening only to opening statements.\n\n&gt;(e.g. Committed in broad daylight in front of dozens of people/caught on CCTV with DNA evidence).\n\nSee above.  \n\nMoreover, what's the point in saying you support something as long as everything is done perfectly when the system in place never does it perfectly--or anywhere remotely near perfectly?  It's like saying \"I like watching MMA, but only when there's no wrestling and the winner is always a pure, traditionalist Taekwondo practitioner who wins with a flurry of kicks\"\n\nOdds are, if there's a trial and the defendant is denying involvement, there's potential holes in the DA's case-- it's NOT a slam dunk case where there's 100% proof.  Additionally, the trials where the state DOES have a ton of evidence against the defendant typically aren't trials where the defendant is denying they did it, but instead the defense is arguing it was justified or there was a mental illness, etc. \n\n"}, {"id": "2n9byk", "body": "More specifically, I support the death penalty provided that the accused is given a fair trial and is proven in court beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the crime (e.g. Committed in broad daylight in front of dozens of people/caught on CCTV with DNA evidence).

Killing them after their crime prevents them from doing more harm, but it also prevents them from trying to fix what they've done.\n* As /u/skinbearxett said, the death of the killer doesn't make the victim's family better (because the person they lost won't come back), but it will grieve the killer's family. And maybe they'll try to have revenge too ? Who knows ?\n* You also have to figure out where is the limit between letting someone live and ending his life. Does murder qualifies for DS ? How about rape ? Statutory rape ? Involuntary manslaughter ? Thievery ? Mass computer hacking ? You have to be sure, because that's a **hard line** from where there is no coming back.\n* Then of course, their is the error, because there always are errors. What if your siblings are accused/sentenced/killed, when you know **for certain** they are innocent but can't prove it. How fair would that feel ?\n\nThere is much more, but here's what comes off the top of my here.\n\n\n**Edit :** my opinion about the \"cost\". I don't think that death penalty costs more that life in prison. It **does** cost more as it is done in the USA, but maybe there are better ways to do it. How about executing them within a month ?

And by using the death penalty the US joins a very short list of absolutely repugnant countries that continue to use it.\n\nI end up feeling like the world would be such a better place is North Korea, Iran, etc. stopped killing people and, while in the US we can actually have debates about due process and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, we should set an example for the rest of the world that justice means moving beyond the desire for revenge, no matter how horrible the crime."}, {"id": "2n9byk", "body": "More specifically, I support the death penalty provided that the accused is given a fair trial and is proven in court beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the crime (e.g. Committed in broad daylight in front of dozens of people/caught on CCTV with DNA evidence).

If we, as a society, say that killing a person is wrong - it's illogical to kill people as a punishment. \n\nWe should, instead, categorically oppose killing in all circumstances. By *refusing* to enact capital punishment, we're saying \"what you did was monstrous, and we won't allow you to force us to stoop to your level - we're better than that.\" \n\nIt makes sense to isolate people, even for life, who may be dangerous to society. But by killing them, we are (in effect) agreeing that killing is appropriate under certain circumstances. The only difference between a murder and an execution is that more people approve of an execution. Are we really prepared to live in a society that is okay with murder as long as 51% agrees with it? \n\nThroughout history, people have been legally executed for reasons that, today, we would consider monstrous. Brutal executions for 'heresy' were common well into the 14th century. People are still, today, executed in theocratic countries for actions that are not only legal but celebrated in Western countries (seeking education, divorce, same-sex relationships, etc.) The fact that these executions are legal and (in some cases) popular in these countries doesn't make them any less disgusting. In a few decades, we in the Western world may feel the same way about capital punishment for murder. \n\nOverall, legal punishment should serve two functions 1.) rehabilitation and 2.) protection for society.

Ie libertarians who support laissez-fair capitalism and private property.\n\nTo my understanding, Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary, mutual agreements.\n\nI am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself (in fact I think it is fine). Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

This is how I'm reading your position. If I'm wrong, then I apologize, disregard the rest of the comment.\n\nFirst off, you cannot leave most countries with all of your property intact. Expatriation taxes are a real thing that most first-world countries do. But let's just say that this is an unjust law and not truly representative of the actual concept of government.\n\nLet's start with the very simplest analogy I can think of: say that I came up to you (say we're both somewhere that we have equal rights to be - neither of us owns whatever property we're on or otherwise has the right to make the other leave) and told you \"you need to get out of my sight or I'm gonna punch you in the nose\" and you refused. Would it then be valid for me to claim \"You *chose* the broken nose - if you didn't want it, you could've left\"?\n\nNow let's make it slightly more complex. Let's say that I told you that you needed to either pay me to be there, leave, or get punched in the nose. Same situation about whether we own where we're standing and whatnot, just add the monetary option to avoid being punched in the face. Would it be valid then? Could I say \"you had *two* ways to avoid this broken nose you've got now, so really it's your fault,\" or if you'd paid but complained about it, \"well, you could've just left if you wanted to keep your money, you *chose* to pay me.\" Or would I still be overstepping and committing aggression against you?\n\nNow complicate it even further. Say that I, without your say-so or agreement in the matter, gave you some gifts that are impossible for you to return. Say I walked up to you and shined your shoes, gave you a massage, played some music you liked, and various other things that you can't give back, all without regard to whether you asked, or even if you vocally refused. Say that I then made the demand from the previous paragraph - pay me, leave, or get punched in the face - and tacked on that this payment was for those gifts. Would I be in the right to punch you in the face for refusing payment? Would my claims that you chose to pay me have any more weight because of these gifts?\n\nOne more level of complication - say I did all of the above things for you, then gave you the pay me for the gifts, leave, or get punched ultimatum, and added that all of your neighbors hired me and asked for all of these services at the price I'd asked. Would the fact that the rest of the neighborhood legitimately wanted these services make it okay for me to punch you in the face for non-payment, or grant any validity to the claim that you'd chosen to pay me if you decided that you didn't want to leave or get punched?\n\nNow, in case the analogy is one of those times where what I'm saying makes tons of sense to me but not to anybody else - in this scenario I am the government. The punch in the face is imprisonment and the various punishments that go along with tax evasion. The unsolicited gifts are the services provided by the government. And the neighbors are the electorate. Claiming that you should leave somewhere that I don't own is overstepping what I may rightfully claim, and enforcing it is aggression. If you want to say that the government owns all of the land it governs, then we have a different disagreement.\n\nYou make some valid points about corporations and coercion. I think in most cases if you dug deeper you'd find that whatever coercive corporation in question has some privilege granted by the government that enables its coerciveness. For the oft-quoted coal-mining company-store example, were it not for exclusive mining-rights granted by the government, I have a hard time believing that a competitor wouldn't be able to siphon off the workforce of the abusive company. I mean, think about how easy that'd be - you buy a chunk of land near the coal seam and offer to pay basically any amount in actual money as opposed to company scrip.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that libertarians do not believe that an organization is good simply because it is a private corporation as opposed to the government. Simply pointing out that sometimes corporations do coercive stuff doesn't invalidate libertarianism any more than pointing out that sometimes governments commit genocide invalidates statism.\n\nEDIT: I just re-read this, and your statement above, and feel like there's something I should clarify. Libertarians are against *aggression*. Sometimes there is only one viable choice, but not due to anyone's aggression. Working vs. starving is one of those - nobody is committing any act of aggression against someone who does not work, the laws of physics and biology necessitate eating to live; choosing a course of action where you don't get to eat simply opens you to that. Claiming that one is not free because they'll starve if they don't work is asinine - is a lion not free because it must hunt to eat? Aggression requires that someone actively seeks to harm (or threatens this) your person or property - not just ignores you. If the work vs. starve dichotomy involves aggression, then it is the entire universe committing this act because out of the entire universe no entity provided the non-worker with food. Now, if you were like \"screw &lt;company&gt;, I'm gonna start my own company instead\", or \"I think I'll grow my food\", and someone actively prevented this using force, and libertarians were okay with that, *this* would be a contradiction. Saying that, because libertarians are okay with some non-choices, that means it's contradictory when they're not okay with the non-choice between expatriation, paying taxes, or jail misses what libertarians are actually against.

And the neighbors are the electorate. Claiming that you should leave somewhere that I don't own is overstepping what I may rightfully claim, and enforcing it is aggression. If you want to say that the government owns all of the land it governs, then we have a different disagreement.\n\nYou make some valid points about corporations and coercion. I think in most cases if you dug deeper you'd find that whatever coercive corporation in question has some privilege granted by the government that enables its coerciveness. For the oft-quoted coal-mining company-store example, were it not for exclusive mining-rights granted by the government, I have a hard time believing that a competitor wouldn't be able to siphon off the workforce of the abusive company. I mean, think about how easy that'd be - you buy a chunk of land near the coal seam and offer to pay basically any amount in actual money as opposed to company scrip.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that libertarians do not believe that an organization is good simply because it is a private corporation as opposed to the government. Simply pointing out that sometimes corporations do coercive stuff doesn't invalidate libertarianism any more than pointing out that sometimes governments commit genocide invalidates statism.\n\nEDIT: I just re-read this, and your statement above, and feel like there's something I should clarify. Libertarians are against *aggression*. Sometimes there is only one viable choice, but not due to anyone's aggression. Working vs. starving is one of those - nobody is committing any act of aggression against someone who does not work, the laws of physics and biology necessitate eating to live; choosing a course of action where you don't get to eat simply opens you to that. Claiming that one is not free because they'll starve if they don't work is asinine - is a lion not free because it must hunt to eat? Aggression requires that someone actively seeks to harm (or threatens this) your person or property - not just ignores you. If the work vs. starve dichotomy involves aggression, then it is the entire universe committing this act because out of the entire universe no entity provided the non-worker with food. Now, if you were like \"screw &lt;company&gt;, I'm gonna start my own company instead\", or \"I think I'll grow my food\", and someone actively prevented this using force, and libertarians were okay with that, *this* would be a contradiction. Saying that, because libertarians are okay with some non-choices, that means it's contradictory when they're not okay with the non-choice between expatriation, paying taxes, or jail misses what libertarians are actually against.

Ie libertarians who support laissez-fair capitalism and private property.\n\nTo my understanding, Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary, mutual agreements.\n\nI am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself (in fact I think it is fine). Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

Rather than improving itself, the system is militarizing. I don't fancy a few more decades of hoping it will be reformed under the uncaring eye of the government.\n\n&gt; In a private system the police aren't' even supposed to pay attention to someone who's not writing their paychecks.\n\nThat's an assumption. I think you assume it would be obscenely expensive in a private system. Almost every poor person in America has a TV, car, cell phone, refrigerator, air conditioning, etc. The poor now would have enough money to fund a few hundred dollars a year or less for police services. The truly destitute could get help with charity.\n\n&gt;The thing that causes this is high price lawyers and judges willing to take kickbacks, Privatizing the legal system will not fix this, if anything it will exacerbate the problem.\n\nOnly if you assume there would be only one private legal system, versus competing companies who provide police, courts, and other defense services. A competitive system is very very possible, such as the one described by David Friedman in his book The Machinery of Freedom. You can watch a ~25 minute intro [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o).\n\n&gt;Unless you're poor, then your still fucked regardless of the system.

Sadly, this model is reserved for \"ambulance chasers\" who are derided, but are in fact performing vital legal services for the less fortunate. \n\nThe public defender is lip service in a system where the overwhelming majority of people take plea bargains because they cannot afford trial. That is not a good reason to keep the current system. And again, the poor could pay for private defense in a market system, as competition makes things cheap.

Government agencies that impose regulations of various businesses more often than not have quite a few superfluous regulations that were lobbied for by corporations. Meeting these regulatory requirements makes it more difficult for people to start up a business, which decreases competition. If these regulations were removed, then more businesses could arise and would compete to have the best labour force, which means they would have to offer slightly higher wages. \n\nI know what will come up is the proposal that these regulations keep us safe, and some of them do. But it's bad business to market an unsafe product. Because we're in the 21st century and information can be spread quickly, if a corporation is doing something unsafe for the public, people will find out and there will be outcry, which will hurt the company, so it's bast to make sure that the product is safe. \n\nAs for your final paragraph, I don't consider the current situation fair because of crony capitalism.

I don't see how this belief would make it so I can't complain about the status quo when the status quo is not a free market. \n\nAs for how government is no different than a corporation, with a corporation you sign a mutual agreement for work.

It uses your money to hire private companies to provide those services. Now cutting out the middleman is where some libertarians disagree. I'm a minarchist rather than an anarchist and ave no problem with that level of government. However, roads, for instance would still exist without government. They could be toll roads. Or if the roads lead to and near businesses, the businesses could pay to have the roads made and periodically fixed through an annual budget, which would be in a voluntary agreement between to two private enterprises. This is even done with some roads in america, but is very uncommon because government usually acts as the middleman. While I don't agree that it would be better, it's also possible for a private police force to exist. People would buy insurance that would cover problems that normally the public police force deals with. When it becomes necessary, the insurance company would work with the private police force to help you with the legal problem you face. Private investigators do exist.

I'm not saying monopolies would never happen, but I am saying they would be short-lived. \n\n&gt;I'm basically making the analogy that what country you choose to live in is a \"free market\" in the same way as these corporations would be in a libertarian society. Meaning, if you don't consider crony capitalism fair, then you still have the choice to leave or start your own nation (in the hopes that more people will support you and also move to it)\n\nI think I understand what you mean. I think the concept of going to start one's own nation is not analogous to changing jobs due to the amount of work required. Instead, the best option would be to change the system, since that is part of the \"contract\" I'm in with the government even though I never consented to it. \n\n&gt;A company also has rules. You are just as free to leave a (democratic) country as you are to leave a company. You just won't have the benefits of being a part of it anymore. Maybe you didn't sign an explicit agreement, but you voluntarily agree to stay there.\n\nA problem I have with your argument here is that it seems to assume that the policies of a government or company are stagnant. Those policies can be changed by workers and voters. \n\nI don't see how staying in a country is analogous to sticking with a job. The amount of work required to change one's situation is vastly different. For many, it is unfeasible to leave the country. It's much more feasible to change jobs, especially in a free market. \n\n&gt;Right, just like a company takes a large cut of the profits your labour makes to maintain and improve the means of production you've been using.\n\nCould you expand on how these two situations are analogous?

Ie libertarians who support laissez-fair capitalism and private property.\n\nTo my understanding, Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary, mutual agreements.\n\nI am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself (in fact I think it is fine). Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

So how does this interact with their NAP?  Take a look at point 1 above.  The implication is that if B \"initiates aggression\" (Libertarian term) against A, A is allowed to use violence.  Using/not using violence is usually considered a binary switch, there is no concept of proportionality, but that's a different discussion.  But government has a *monopoly* on violence.  So how does that affect A's right to respond?  The answer to that is complicated and depends on how hardcore of a Libertarian you are talking to, but this debate is *so central* to the discussion, it answers your question about why governments and corporations are fundamentally different.  Now a Libertarian paradise would be one where yes, government(s) *is(are)* treated the same as corporations.  But we do not live in that world, we live in one where the government of your area has a monopoly on violence."}, {"id": "cmbqmbj", "body": "I'll repost what /u/subheight640 posted at one point, but it got deleted:\n\n&gt;I disagree with you on another level. Libertarians are not consistent. The definition of \"force\" in the non-aggression principle is wildly inconsistent IMO. It's not \"mathematical\". There are too many exceptions granted to NAP to make it coherent. \n\n&gt;* Take for example \"trapping\" people without using direct force. The most direct way to trap them is to restrain them using your own, physical force. This is obviously not allowed.\n\n&gt;* Now what about trapping them indirectly, by inviting them into your house and then locking the door? NAP allows you to perhaps reasonably say this is too an act of \"aggression\", even though no physical force has been applied. \n\n&gt;* How about land-locking someone's property? Now Libertarians have to make up some \"Right to Egress\" - the right to enter/leave/return to his own property. To me, the Right to Egress thus forbids any commercial monopoly on roads, toll-bridges, and any transportation in general. It suggests that commercial transportation is forced to serve you in special cases. We're treading close to that evil statism now. \n\n&gt;* How about \"trapping\" people economically by forming monopolies? Now you're forcing someone to do something against their will, because the alternative is economic starvation. Now Libertarians surely support this kind of trapping for some reason, even though some may oppose the monopoly on transportation as stated above. The vast majority of Libertarians simply refuse to recognize the possibility of monopolies ever forming - for example, they cannot conceive of a local company monopolizing the town's water supply without \"government help\". They'll always irrationally re-shift the blame onto the government. \n\n&gt;Now let's take a look at Libertarian murder.\n\n&gt;* Yes, killing someone directly is illegal.\n\n&gt;* How about assassination? You're not doing the aggression directly. You're just paying for the service. It's probably not OK if you know that the assassin will kill the victim, but what if the money is just a \"gift\"? How are you being \"aggressive\"? I'm sure Libertarians will find some sort of argument to oppose it.\n\n&gt;* How about selling guns to terrorists and criminals? Yes, most Libertarians are for this. How about selling guns to terrorists, and at the same time making speech in favor of terrorism? How about selling guns to terrorists at massively discounted rates? How about giving those guns to terrorists? At what point are you criminally liable? At what point are you actually supporting the terrorists so much that you are \"involved with the crime\"? At what point does your speech become an order? I don't think NAP is particularly good at answering this question, because NAP is so individual-focused that it can't conceive of complex criminal conspiracies. \n\n&gt;* You can't kill them directly, but how about killing them through a contract? Let's say you make a product that will kill 1 out of 5 people that use it. That's obviously a form of aggression, right? What if you explicitly state before the purchase that this product is indeed harmful and the consumer assumes all risk? What if you've hidden this information in a complicated contract, but he still signs it at the end? Exactly at what point does \"consensual self-harm\" turn into \"will-full aggression/fraud against the consumer\"?\n\n&gt;In the end, I disagree that Libertarians try to derive ethics from \"reason\". The moral basis for their philosophy, at least for Libertarians who hold NAP to high esteem, is simply a bad basis. Aggression is so poorly defined that Libertarians just redefine the word to whatever political/moral bias they have. Libertarians emotionally react to define aggression - and they all react differently so aggression is always defined differently for every Libertarian. So you see, emotion is built directly into NAP to suit the Libertarian. If Libertarianism was so reasonably organized, you would think there would be consensus on all the tenants of Libertarianism, because every adherent could start from its fundamental axioms and then derive out all of the components.

Ie libertarians who support laissez-fair capitalism and private property.\n\nTo my understanding, Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary, mutual agreements.\n\nI am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself (in fact I think it is fine). Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

Ie libertarians who support laissez-fair capitalism and private property.\n\nTo my understanding, Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary, mutual agreements.\n\nI am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself (in fact I think it is fine). Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

(easily done by keeping wages high at first, then decreasing after monopoly is attained) New businesses cannot compete with a monopoly, especially not if they offer higher wages to their employees.\n\nI'd like to challenge your belief that a company can become a monopoly by cutting prices way below profit for an extended period of time and recover enough afterward to keep all other potential competitors out. Many people believe this, but we shouldn't base our beliefs on what others think. \n\nLet's say there are many competing companies and you are an executive in the largest one. You believe that you can form a monopoly, so you gather the other executives for a meeting and address them as follows: I know how we can become a monopoly. We will cut our prices by 50% (or whatever) for 6 months to a year until smaller companies can't make ends meet. We will take a loss of $X million because we will be operating at a loss, but we will emerge as the only company available, at which time we can raise prices higher than they were originally and make a killing.\n\nWhat would they say? \n\n\"Sounds like a bold plan, do you have any case studies of this working?\"\n\n\"Sounds very risky, if it takes longer than you say we could go bankrupt too\"\n\nAnd so on\n\nBut let's say the company's management goes along with it and takes the risk. Give me your version of what would happen next. \n\n&gt;That threat of violence is present because you profit of society and infrastructure. It is the only way to ensure the rules in exchange for those benefits are met.\n\nTaxes don't only pay for infrastructure. And what does profiting from society mean? \n\n&gt;It is exactly the same for a company. You accept the rules that company provides in exchange for the benefits of using its means of production. \n\nExcept you get to choose the company and leave it whenever you want. \n\n&gt;Breaking those rules will be met with violence, too.\n\nNo, misbehavior in a company is met with firing someone, not threatening them with violence. \n\n&gt;A country you are born in, and the agreement is informal. But you implicitly agree to it nonetheless, by staying in that country and benefitting from its society.\n\nPlease show me your argument for how the government acquired ownership of all land within its control. By \"staying in,\" you mean by \"staying in the property of the government,\" I assume. You have to show how the government came to own everything. "}]}
