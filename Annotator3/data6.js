I think if everyone considered the merits, for themselves, of showering in the morning, we would still have a majority of morning-showerers, but it would be a different majority.\n\n&gt;My CMV is about the objective merits. \n\nFirst, I just wanted to applaud what you said above.  I think this is very true.  Most of us do one or the other out of custom or habit, not objective review of the pros and cons.  \n\nBut let's get really objective, for that's why we're in CMV.\n\n&gt;When you shower in the morning, you get to go to work / school completely clean and fresh and don't feel gross from sleeping and sweating. \n\nOne could argue that as long as you showered before you went to bed, you'll feel clean and fresh enough even when you leave the house in the morning.  The key here, before you jump on me, is *enough*.  We can't be clean and fresh all the time, or else we should just shower as often as possible, like multiple times a day.  But then, you could just shower before bed and in the morning, and the argument changes from morning vs. evening to once vs. multiple times a day, and I believe that's a totally different argument.  \n\n&gt;Most people sweat more in their sleep than during their day-to-day activities. (There are a variety of reasons for this, including nightmares and the heat of being under blankets, at least for me.)\n\nThis varies with people and I'm sure many people will disagree.  E.g. people where physical activity is part of their day job/school day, or during the summer when you sweat the moment you leave the house, but you can afford to turn on the AC in your home, so that your sleep is relatively sweat-less.  \n\n\n\n\n&gt;Showering is also a relaxing way to \"warm up\" (literally) for the day. For people who normally wake up 10 minutes before class or work, adopting a morning shower creates a buffer period in which your mind and body can fully awake, making you fully productive right when you begin work.\n\nFor other people, this may be more of a nuisance, especially those that want to minimize the number of things they do in the morning.  For some people, they have other ways to wake up in the morning.  For them, it seems weird that you'd take a shower *just* to wake yourself up.  Just eating breakfast might wake some people up enough.  It can also depend on the weather.  Unless you really make sure, you might feel a bit wet after a shower, especially your hair.  I wouldn't want to be even a little wet, body or hair, when the temperature outside is super cold.  That'd be quite uncomfortable.  \n\n&gt;Many evening-showerers object that it is equally gross to dirty your bed with the sweat of the day. I argue that you should probably be washing your sheets on a semi-weekly basis anyway. Also, many people who say this still nap in their beds in the afternoon, and do not shower before doing so.\n\nMany people wash their hands when they come back home, because they want or they want to think that their home is cleaner than the outside.  It kind of makes sense because we touch our surroundings a lot more at home than outside.  And we are in physical touch with our surroundings the most when we're in bed.  This may be why some people want to keep their beds the cleanest part of the house.  These are people who like to shower before bed.  Regarding the napping thing, I've actually felt that evening showerers people tend to nap on the couch or maybe on top of their quilt (not underneath), exactly because they want to keep the inside of their bed, where they actually sleep, clean.  \n\nThe frequency at which you clean your sheets, I feel, is a separate issue and is closer to the shower once a day vs. shower multiple times a day argument.  You can always make your bed cleaner by cleaning them at a greater frequency, whether you're a day or evening showerer.  The point is to have or feel like you have a cleaner bed over all.  If you're a morning showerer and you clean your sheets semi-weekly, that doesn't mean evening showerers should just clean their sheets once every 3 or 4 weeks because their beds are already relatively cleaner.  They may clean their sheets at the same frequency as you do, and thus they will feel as though they are maintaining a cleaner bed overall on average, which is their goal.  \n\n&gt;I am surprised by how vehement the people I meet who shower in the evening are about it. Many have attempted to \"convert\" me from my morning shower, but I have not been persuaded yet. \n\nAnd I am also surprised by how vehement some morning showerers are about how their practice is superior!

However, I do research in quantum chemistry and materials science, and thus my conclusions about life are very evidence-based.  However, I am not a positivist. (Why not? Roughly because I could imagine the Standard Model having fields that don't have interaction mechanisms with the other fields.  See the weak coupling gluons have for instance.  The fact that there may not be a \"field chain\" leading to our human senses is not, in my opinion, a good argument for the nonexistence of those fields.)\n\nWith regard to my religious beliefs, I subscribe to the philosophies of Christ and the Christian religion (treat others kindly, turn the other cheek, etc.), but I believe the miracles in the Bible are simply parables, and it is not likely that they actually occurred.  I do, however, believe in God, mainly because of the fact that I have experiential consciousness (as opposed to neurological consciousness); meaning, of all things I am certain of, I am *most* certain of the fact that I am experiencing my own existence.  Everything else could essentially be faked with sufficient enough technology.  I'm not looking to get into a debate about p-zombies; I'm just presenting my viewpoint on religion so you have some background to work with.\n\nThus, I do believe that God (whatever form He takes) created the laws of physics, and from those laws everything else came about.  And experiential consciousness implies to me that God ultimately intended the existence of beings capable of experiencing the universe that came about from the laws He created.  So there is at least a small \"personal\" aspect to God, as opposed to a godless universe full of automatons obeying uncreated time-transformation rules.\n\nHowever, that's the limit of the \"personal\" nature of God for me.  **Most religions believe that God is loving and caring, but I'm not so sure.  Here's my reasons why:**\n\n**1)** For one thing, God has never communicated directly with us; at least not in a way that everyone can believe with certainty, and definitely not with me personally (and if He ever did, I completely missed it.  It was too subtle.)  Why would a loving God leave us so bereft of communication?\n\n**2)** Following up #1, there is no indication at all of what happens when we die.  Every religion thinks something different happens, and heck, even the individual religions are totally lacking in specifics.  The Bible says \"eternal life\" and \"roads paved with gold\" (which is clearly nonliteral) and not a whole lot more.  Why would a God who loves us torture us with the constant uncertainty about our ultimate fate?  I can never enjoy any happy moment, because in the back of my mind, there is the lingering thought that ultimately my existence might be pointless, and the net result of everything will be the same as if I had never existed at all.\n\n**3)** Pain and suffering.  My mom died from cancer.  A girl about my age (who was valedictorian of her class in HS, a kind person, and an extremely hard worker) died of bone cancer.  My grandfather died of brain cancer.  My neighbors were killed less than a month ago by a drunk driver, leaving their three kids parentless.  How many millions died in the Holocaust?  How many are being tortured in North Korea right now?  Children are dying of starvation left and right.  People are constantly raped, murdered, and sold into slavery.  Freak accidents kill people in terrifically painful ways.  Do I really need to spell out the obvious here?\n\nDoes any of this sound like what most people call \"love\"?  Invent a new word for it, because it sure doesn't match any definition of \"love\" I've ever heard.  I am unable to come up with a good counterargument to the above three points, and I have been trying for years, because I desperately want to believe in a kind, loving God.  Unlike some people, I'm incapable of putting aside logic and believing whatever makes me feel better.  I don't say that in a mean way; in fact I envy the traditionalists who are raised to believe that everything is going to be okay in the end and who don't think any further about it.  That would make life much less depressing for me.\n\n**To go ahead and preempt some of the common objections I can imagine:**\n\n**1)** God has a plan.  This objection comes up due to the idea that God is infinite and incomprehensible, and that He has a plan that we cannot understand.  Pain and suffering are trivialities that in the end won't matter much.  Well, the funny thing about God's plan is that it looks a lot like the plan of somebody who doesn't have one.  I have no issue with God being infinite and incomprehensible, but why does that automatically make His plan beneficial or caring toward us humans?  That is a leap that requires explanation.\n\n**2)** God gave us free will.  So person-to-person evil is not God's doing, but man's.  Okay, but even assuming free will, He is still allowing extraordinary evil to occur.  I can think of plenty of methods to retain free will while preventing harm to others (we work toward this goal all the time in society).\n\n**3)** God doesn't exist, and thus your argument is based on a faulty premise.  Well, that would be a different CMV, wouldn't it?  See if you can CMV with the constraint of an extant God.  There's plenty of people who believe in God AND believe He is loving; I just want them to support their viewpoint and convince me of it.\n\n**EDIT:** I don't really like the harsh, accusatory tone of these replies.  As someone with intense social anxiety, I was hoping this sub-reddit might be a little better about cordial replies that the rest of Reddit, but it doesn't seem that way.  Sorry I inadvertently bothered so many people.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I would contend that if one believes in a pleasant afterlife then death is not a bad thing.\n\n*If* one believes in a pleasant afterlife.  My great-grandmother believed with certainty in the afterlife, and death for her was quite a pleasant process.  However, I am uncertain about whether the afterlife exists, so that makes death much less pleasant.  Well, not so much death itself (I hope it will be quick and painless), but rather the decades of life I spend thinking about death before it occurs.  For an all-powerful being, surely if He was loving He could think of a good solution to this problem.  Why must the laws have been designed to evolve our minds into death-fearing creatures?  Could it have not been done any other way?\n\n&gt; God gave us free-will as a great act of love ... It follows that to give direct undeniable proof of his existence would be to take that free will from us.\n\nDoes additional knowledge imply a lessening of free will?  I always thought that free will was the ability to act freely upon knowledge.  In that sense, it is an open question of whether God's certain existence (widespread consensus that He exists), would cause a \"grudging acceptance\".  If He is truly a loving God, I can't imagine too many people would be unhappy about it (even though they are free to be that way).  \n\n&gt; We would not be able to fully understand the beauty of heaven if we haven't experienced suffering.\n\nThis assumes that we need bad to know good.

I have a scale of certainties.  While experiencing my own existence is indeed at the top of the list, that others experience their own existence as well is a very close second.

Invent a new word for it, because it sure doesn't match any definition of \"love\" I've ever heard.

I have no issue with God being infinite and incomprehensible, but why does that automatically make His plan beneficial or caring toward us humans?  That is a leap that requires explanation.\n\n**2)** God gave us free will.  So person-to-person evil is not God's doing, but man's.

Perhaps a Deist that may be on the path towards Agnosticism and Atheism.\n\nThe notion of a \"personal god\" should be able to be tested materially.  If god cares and watches over us, and wants us to \"know\" him, then it would be reasonable to assume he could make himself known in some un-ambiguous way.    Unfortunately this doesn't happen, and as a result, the same argument used to justify god's personal interest in you or anyone else, could also be used to justify any supernatural claim that refuses to be able to be materially-tested.  You've come to understand it is not rational to maintain a belief in something that does not appear be qualifiable.

I can never enjoy any happy moment, because in the back of my mind, there is the lingering thought that ultimately my existence might be pointless, and the net result of everything will be the same as if I had never existed at all.\n\n**3)** Pain and suffering.  My mom died from cancer.  A girl about my age (who was valedictorian of her class in HS, a kind person, and an extremely hard worker) died of bone cancer.  My grandfather died of brain cancer.  My neighbors were killed less than a month ago by a drunk driver, leaving their three kids parentless.  How many millions died in the Holocaust?  How many are being tortured in North Korea right now?  Children are dying of starvation left and right.  People are constantly raped, murdered, and sold into slavery.  Freak accidents kill people in terrifically painful ways.  Do I really need to spell out the obvious here?\n\nDoes any of this sound like what most people call \"love\"?  Invent a new word for it, because it sure doesn't match any definition of \"love\" I've ever heard.  I am unable to come up with a good counterargument to the above three points, and I have been trying for years, because I desperately want to believe in a kind, loving God.  Unlike some people, I'm incapable of putting aside logic and believing whatever makes me feel better.  I don't say that in a mean way; in fact I envy the traditionalists who are raised to believe that everything is going to be okay in the end and who don't think any further about it.  That would make life much less depressing for me.\n\n**To go ahead and preempt some of the common objections I can imagine:**\n\n**1)** God has a plan.  This objection comes up due to the idea that God is infinite and incomprehensible, and that He has a plan that we cannot understand.  Pain and suffering are trivialities that in the end won't matter much.  Well, the funny thing about God's plan is that it looks a lot like the plan of somebody who doesn't have one.  I have no issue with God being infinite and incomprehensible, but why does that automatically make His plan beneficial or caring toward us humans?  That is a leap that requires explanation.\n\n**2)** God gave us free will.  So person-to-person evil is not God's doing, but man's.  Okay, but even assuming free will, He is still allowing extraordinary evil to occur.  I can think of plenty of methods to retain free will while preventing harm to others (we work toward this goal all the time in society).\n\n**3)** God doesn't exist, and thus your argument is based on a faulty premise.  Well, that would be a different CMV, wouldn't it?  See if you can CMV with the constraint of an extant God.  There's plenty of people who believe in God AND believe He is loving; I just want them to support their viewpoint and convince me of it.\n\n**EDIT:** I don't really like the harsh, accusatory tone of these replies.  As someone with intense social anxiety, I was hoping this sub-reddit might be a little better about cordial replies that the rest of Reddit, but it doesn't seem that way.

It's currently not as widely accepted like FIAT cash and don't think it will be anytime soon if at all.  FIAT cash can easily be put in a bank or held physically under the mattress and is accepted by 100% of the population.  BTC isn't.  Cash can be used everyday to purchase any legal goods your mind can think of.  \n\nIf you have a ton of cash it can be stored in a bank that is insured by the FDIC while BTC isn't insured by anyone.  In order to properly secure thousands of dollars of BTC you have to go through elaborate schemes such as remember passphrases, printing out papers and hiding them somewhere, or as recently seen someone hiding their BTC address underneath a watch.\n\nWhy are we trying to push BTC mainstream?

Even better, I can get direct deposit and remove this issue entirely.\n\n&gt;Cash is easy to lose and is fast becoming dangerous - both cops and criminals can rob you.\n\nLol at the cops robbing you. I don't remember the last time I lost my wallet or anything over change. You can get robbed, yes. You can also get robbed by using bitcoin. Look at MtGox, people lost millions.\n\n&gt;Cash is easy to lose and is fast becoming dangerous - both cops and criminals can rob you.\n\nAnd covered by insurance. My Visa got figured out by some unscrupulous individual. I got a call from the bank that day asking if I had made purchases. When I told them I hadn't they cancelled the card and covered the cost of the money spent. You have to do something *really* stupid or be working with a *really* shitty bank to get burned using credit cards.\n\n&gt;Lives have been drastically altered by identity theft. I know I family who postponed starting a family to clear BOTH of their credit histories because someone swiped their cards.\n\nReally? I haven't heard of this happening. Is it an American thing? I'm a Canadian so I don't know.\n\n&gt;Banks will get tired of maintaining massive server farms and security apparatuses just to ensure people can keep swiping. Cryptos offer a much better way of decentralizing resources.\n\nWhy will banks get tired? They are going to offer the services as long as people use them. Further, why do we want decentralization? If big banks deal with more people they are a bigger target, yes, but they also have more incentive to protect my information.\n\n&gt;You argument is akin to \"we already have horses, we don't need cars\".\n\nWe already have nice cars, we don't need 5 wheeled cars because they're new and different.\n\n&gt;Waiting for transactions to post is dumb.\n\nAnd an issue for a small number of people. Unless you're part of the working poor (I guess a large number? Still though) you can plan your shit accordingly.\n\n&gt;Not having a quick way to send money to family in Europe is dumb.\n\nWhere bitcoiners always lose me. We have easy ways, it's called bank transfers. If those don't work you have money transfers. Bitcoins are *not* easier, you need to have an account on either side, get verification, and get a hold of both internet access *and* somewhere to cash out if you want to use your money. If you can't pull money out in Europe getting bitcoins won't do you much good.\n\n&gt;Not having a quick way to pay a friend back for dinner is dumb.\n\nCash. It's really, really easy.\n\n&gt;Having to pay INSANE amounts of money for realtors, lawyers, and other middlemen is dumb.\n\nIn what transactions?\n\n&gt;Think of how many professions the Internet killed : video rental clerks, travel agents, cashiers, photo processors, desktop publishers. We're long overdue for a shakeup in the stagnant swamp of personal finance, and magic beans can deliver that.\n\nI don't see how bitcoin will kill realters. They will still want to get paid for finding you a house. If anything the internet would have killed them.\n\nNow, the major negatives to bitcoins.\n\n1) No one is controlling the money pool.\n\nBitcoin supporters seem to think that this is good. I disagree. When your \"currency\" can fluctuate by hundreds of percentages overnight that's **awful.** Like, really awful. If were to be running a hypothetical business I want a dollar in my pocket today to equal about a dollar tomorrow. I don't want to close shop and then open up tomorrow and find out my $10k safety net is now $7 because something awful happened.\n\n2) There isn't any monetary regulation.\n\nPulling out Mt. Gox again. What happened to the people responsible for it? What *can* happen? There isn't any sort of punishment available for those who abuse the system because anonymity and lack of regulation is the selling point. That isn't something I want to get involved with, where my money just up and disappears overnight because of who I held my money with. Yada yada, free market will get rid of these people. But it won't, it can't because there's so much money involved and nothing to lose for taking it and running. Say I have access to 7 billion dollars in unregulated currency. If there isn't a risk for punishment what reasons do I have to not take this? Who gives a crap if I go out of business from my actions, I have enough money that I'm set for life.\n\nNot even mentioning that the free market works looking back. If a company is awful you find out *after* people get burned. So you might be one of the lucky ones that goes \"I head that company sucked, I won't work with them.\" Or you could be one of the ones that ends up bankrupt because someone stole from you.\n\nOverall, without repercussions for those who can and will steal from others bitcoins, and cryptocurrencies in general, offer a major risk you won't find with other currency options.\n\n3) Most people won't see the benefits of bitcoin\n\nSeriously, the only thing that bitcoin is really ahead in is anonymity, and if you aren't on the black market who gives a shit. I can go to the store, right now, and buy a chocolate bar 3 different ways: cash, debit, or credit. I'm not sure, but I could probably use a check if I wanted to be hella obnoxious. I can't do that with bitcoin. Then I can order something online, use either my debit or credit, and I have now paid for that item. There aren't any issues. Go to another country, use credit cards, find banks that will work, get money transfers. Banks are getting better and better moving money across borders so bitcoin doesn't do much for that.\n\nSo you get a whole lot of risks and a whole lot of hassle for very little reward. Bitcoin is not going to revolutionize finance.\n"}, {"id": "cmg07b7", "body": "The big difference between bitcoin and the internet is that the internet filled a massive void of needs, whereas bitcoin is arguably inferior to things we already have.

I think saying superior is just cherry-picking *potential* benefits without addressing the costs. The first is that it *isn't* fiat, meaning if bitcoin lost its value tomorrow then there'd be very little inertia to re-starting its value proposition. The *fiat* of fiat currency is a declaration that *this* is the official currency we will use and almost all of our economy is built upon. If it lost its value tomorrow, the social contract agreeing to it being the currency of exchange would the be there, everybody would have most of their wealth tied up into that currency, and the entire economy already has an infrastructure built around it, so it would easily restart and gain value quickly. Changing to something else would be costly without social agreement. Far, far superior to bitcoin in that sense.\n\nBeing decentralized means bitcoin is subject to pure speculative value, and can't be stabilized by outside forces, unlike fiat currency. Insurance, returning goods, and security are also problems for bitcoin. \n\nAnd of course there will never be the \"right security\" for bitcoin, as it is inconceivable to have a currency that nobody else can access.

It's hard to know how long that will last or if it will fail completely. The same can be said for any emerging technology.

That isn't terribly different from people needing to keep their BTC key to access their bitcoins.  While it is true that if I forget my password I can recover it while the same can't be said for bitcoin keys.\n\nBTC isn't likely to replace any major country's currency in our lifetimes but it could certainly be used as a supplement or to compete with an high inflation currency.\n\nI predict that if/when bitcoin continues to evolve, banks will get involved directly.  Whether these banks are the ones we know of today or brand new innovators is obviously yet to be seen.  I believe they will take on the risk of keeping wallets secure and will also do what banks do today which is fractional reserve lending.  In other words they'll lend people the money that you have in your savings account.  The difference will be that they'll have no lender of last resort so interest rates will be more volatile and customers will have to shop based on each bank's riskiness instead of relying on the FDIC (or equivalent).  I think when people are forced to consider the financial prudence of their bank, the banks will actually have to be more prudent than we saw 6 years ago.  Imagine, instead of picking a bank account because of the gimmicks, you'll actually pick based on their reserve ratio.\n\nSince the underlying bitcoin wallet will continue to be public record as part of the blockchain people will know (or at least have the ability to know) when their bank's health is in question.  In theory this would lead to quicker bank runs but the beauty of the system would be that consumers would still have the option of maintaining their wallet themselves without using a bank at all, in contrast to now where avoiding the banking system is next to impossible.  Keep in mind that there would be no reason to have a \"checking\" account so the only money you'd have in the bank is money you were actually saving.  \n\nIt may be that the first place we see a real push for mainstream usage of bitcoin is a country like Cyprus or Venezuela where capital flight concerns and inflation concerns have limited what people can do with their money both from purchasing power perspective and capital movement perspective.  I can see why intuitively it's difficult to think anyone would want to trade their FDIC insured savings account for a uninsured bitcoin account but it should be equally intuitive to see why a saver in a country that offers no such savings insurance would prefer a bitcoin wallet.

US Dollars are printed by a private company, this doesn't stop them from being the most popular currency in the world. And the fact that this money work is based solely on common believe in them. If everyone stops believing in USD, USD is worth nothing.\n\nThere are already numerous physical Bitcoins and they can be easily be made: http://www.coindesk.com/10-physical-bitcoins-good-bad-ugly/\nIt's also not hard to accept Bitcoins to a bank, there is no real difference with fiat money. There are already online accounts you can put your Bitcoins to without knowing anything of how Bitcoin actually works just by accessing it with login and password. Theoretically nothing is stopping PayPal from accepting Bitcoins on par with credit cards.\n\nThere is no insurance only because there is not enough demand.

Bitcoin does have some pretty big aesthetic and ease of use advantages over feces, sure, but trust in value is what makes anything a currency.  Painting that as the only problem is disingenuous.  \n\nThe problem with Bitcoin is that there are so many reasons not to trust it.  For instance, there are hundreds of functionally equivalent cryptocurrencies out there that can make the same claims regarding security, anonymity, etc. that Bitcoin does.  What's stopping speculators from just moving on to the next one?  With Bitcoin, you're asking me to trust in everyone else's trust, and I have yet to see a good explanation of why I should expect that trust to be maintained.  \n\n&gt;Fiat money are just paper.\n\nThis is related to the earlier point.  Sure, fiat currency is paper with a value agreed upon, but it's paper that the government will punish you for not using.  Failure to believe in the US dollar can and does happen, but acting on that lack of belief in the USA is often a crime.  You can't refuse to accept it and you must pay taxes in it.  A dollar is guaranteed to have value as long as the US government exists.  There is no similar mechanism in place for Bitcoin.

It's currently not as widely accepted like FIAT cash and don't think it will be anytime soon if at all.  FIAT cash can easily be put in a bank or held physically under the mattress and is accepted by 100% of the population.  BTC isn't.  Cash can be used everyday to purchase any legal goods your mind can think of.  \n\nIf you have a ton of cash it can be stored in a bank that is insured by the FDIC while BTC isn't insured by anyone.  In order to properly secure thousands of dollars of BTC you have to go through elaborate schemes such as remember passphrases, printing out papers and hiding them somewhere, or as recently seen someone hiding their BTC address underneath a watch.\n\nWhy are we trying to push BTC mainstream?  I feel that it will always be just another form of payment not the one to replace FIAT currency.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But that logic doesn't hold up.  In order to get food I need to pay the grocer.  Does that mean that my payment to the grocer is involuntary?  If so, all exchange of money for goods or services is some version of exploitative or extortive.\n\nAnd given that my relationship to the grocer is the inverse of my relationship to my employer, doesn't that make my relationship with the grocer exploitative from my end as well (since he can only get money by selling me, or someone like me, goods)?  Hell, that would mean that we as workers are exploiting our employers because the only way they get work done is to provide money for it.\n\nSo unless you're going to go so far as to say that the voluntary exchange of goods and services for money is itself non-consensual, your first premise doesn't hold water.  It is a choice, I could choose to not work and not get what I need in order to buy food.

Your arguments speak primarily to morality, so I will only address that\n\nEmploying a person is not morally equivalent to buying a person because employment does not inherently involve taking away a person's rights.  This has nothing to do with compensation -- even if you pay a slave a fair wage, it is still immoral to own them.  The only way it would be moral to own a slave is if the slave agreed to be a slave and the master agreed to free them if the slave ever changed their mind (and of course, the master did not treat the slave immorally).

The way he sees it, and I agree with him, is that it's an art form.  What if Van Gogh had said, \"Well, Leonardo already figured out this whole Art thing so it's pointless for me to try.\"  Or if the Beatles had been like, \"People really like Chuck Berry, so let's throw in the towel.\"  There will *always* be room for new creations."}, {"id": "2nq0rb", "body": "After making games for around 4 years now, I've come to the conclusion that it's all a waste of time.  Indie game makers are often well-liked in theory, but when it comes right down to it, no one really wants to bother with them.\n\nI'm not saying that's a bad thing, though, and that's exactly my point.  If people already like old IPs like Mario and Pokemon, why bother making new ones?  You're not really helping anyone but yourself when you make a new game, because when it comes time to market it, you have to create a need that has already been met by existing games.\n\nThis is why I'm quitting game development.  I don't feel like anyone really wants or needs the thing that I do, and when I do \"create the need\" by advertising, I'm only really promoting greed.\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT:  Thanks to everyone that replied.  I had a little uncharacteristic freak-out moment, and I apologize for that.  Anyway, I've decided not to throw in the towel, and that maybe indie games do have a place in the game scene\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

People will always throw their money at something popular over something innovative. People don't want innovation for its own sake, they want things that are relevant and useful to them, and sometimes that means choosing the activity that is socially relevant. \n\nWhen it comes to tired and overdone games (Call of Duty, etc), the popularity itself is the biggest selling point. You can talk about it over dinner with your friends and family because everyone knows it. Everyone shares their hype and experience and opinions. Whereas you can't do the same thing with a random startup no-name indie game, even if it's objectively a better product. In the end, the mediocre popular game will just have a bigger place in your life. \n\nBut this in no way means that making games is pointless. It just means there's a separation between making games for money and making them for art. If you're trying to make a living as a game developer, then you're not going to avoid the fact that you have to survive. You'll need to learn how to abuse social psychology and some combination of riding bandwagons, manipulating popularity, or abusing addictive behavior. If you're really in it for survival, that's just something you'll have to accept. \n\nOr you could make games only because you know they deserve to exist. Of course, you'll need to make yourself financially secure some other way, and develop with the mindset that it doesn't matter how much money or popularity the finished product brings you, as long as you fulfill your artistic vision. \n\nIf you do this, there's a chance you could still strike it rich if you've found that you created something people didn't realize they even wanted (like Minecraft, the Binding of Isaac, or chunky spaghetti sauce). But that's risky to rely on that. Likely, you will only be appealing to a small number of other people who had the same idea, but didn't have the skill or resources to pull it off. And they will absolutely love you for it, and they will treasure your creation and it will make them happier than any Call of Duty game could hope to. Granted they might be few in number, or they might even not discover your work until you're dead (like Tolkien) but they'll be there. \n\nBut don't be bitter just because your work isn't popular. Just like you can't throw together a song and expect it to make the pop charts, because you're competing with thousands of other songs made by people who have researched and studied how to compete for the consumer's attention and money. If you don't want to to learn how to play the greed game, then just make things to please yourself, and don't give a damn about what other people think. Because honestly the world needs more people who do that.

"}, {"id": "cmg9vbf", "body": "&gt;Disliking all people based on a single physical trait is bigotry.\n\nOP didn't say his friends dislike fat people (or people with big scars, or whatever else they find unattractive).  He only said they thought she was unattractive.  That's different than bigotry.\n\n&gt;You are implying people with extra body fat are inferior. \n\nI mean, not as people they aren't.  As far as society ranks mate quality, they are.  I have lots of issues with society's preferences, but it doesn't matter what I think.  Men who make less money are less desirable as a mate.  They aren't worse as people.  But it's tough to deny that richer men can get prettier or otherwise 'higher desirability' mates than poorer men.\n\n&gt;What you don't understand is that not all people are turned off by chubby partners.\n\nOf course I understand that.  But unless you plan to move to a cabin in Alaska, how society treats you is relevant.\n\n&gt; It doesn't matter if they're compatible and happy.\n\nAbsolutely.  100%.  His friends apparently see less of that and more of the mismatch.  \n\n&gt;Since when did people need to have the same body fat percentage to have a successful relationship?\n\nThey don't have to, any more than they have to have the same educational level.  But relationships that have it last longer than ones that don't.  You should of course look at the totality of a person, not just one factor.\n\n&gt;This whole \"quality\" or \"dating someone similar\" argument is what was used to rationalize against interracial relationships as recently as 10 or 20 years ago\n\nNo, no it's not.  People who hate miscegenation don't think 'black tends to ugly' or 'black tends to be beautiful' or and think that other factors can make up for some color-based difference.  They literally want separation. They think someone who dates outside their race is a traitor.  It's totally different from thinking fat is ugly or taller is better or etc.\n\n&gt;And I believe it's wrong to tell anyone who to date based on any physical attribute.\n\nHow about any mental attribute?  Is it just as wrong to discriminate based on intelligence?  Really only kindness matters if we are going to avoid shallowness.  But in real life, kindness may be the most important thing, but everything matters.  If you want kids, marry someone physically young and healthy enough.  If you want society to treat you a certain way, there are appearance-related factors to consider.  There are thousands if not millions of attributes one may want to consider."}, {"id": "cmfqx3d", "body": "Holding men and women to different standards (expecting women to be beautiful by society's standard of beauty, expecting women to be nice, expecting men to be wealthy, expecting men to work hard, etc etc) is certainly a societal problem.

They just think you are mismatched in quality, and that a mismatch in quality only makes sense if the 'flaw' is in some way shared.  \n\nBy all means, date her if you like her.  But don't judge the people who are judging your relationship.  They are trying to help you, and their criticisms are informed by the fact that relationships with large mismatches in 'quality' have higher rates of breakup/divorce.

It is very likely that your girl will end up requiring fairly expensive medical care (diabetes care, heart surgery reconstructive joint surgery etc.) at some point and you may (will almost certainly) be called upon to support her ($$$) during this time.\n\nWhat you're overlooking is that there are lots of things people do that is bad for their health.  It's \"insanely\" bad to eat a lot of bacon and other processed meats because you may be higher risk for colon cancer.   And you expect your partner to support you ($$$) while you get butt surgery and have to wear a colostomy bag for your poo.\n\nYou may drive extra fast in the highway.  Motor vehicle wrecks are a top cause of injuries.  Nobody should date you because if you wreck, your partner will support you ($$$) while you're stuck in the hosptial?\n\nWhat about excessive soda consumption?  Cancer risk from acrylamide in grilled foods?  Cancer and liver damage from alcohol?   Cancer and stroke risk from smoking?  Trauma risk from extreme sports?  General health issues from sedentary lifestyle? \n\n&gt;Also, dude she's fat for a reason, poor diet, lack of exercise whatever it is if you two share a life long enough it will almost certainly start to rub off on you. \n\nFat is not contagious.
