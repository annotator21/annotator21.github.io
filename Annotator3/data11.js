That number is too high, but to compare it to slavery--when virtually all black Americans were slaves--is absurd.

There have been many unpopular presidents before him, who were of course white.\n\n&gt; Point is, it doesn't help the rest of os regular folk out here.\n\nHaving prominent black people in positions of power does help regular black people.

He would point out, among other things, that the last year in which there was no minimum wage law, 1930, was also the last year in which unemployment rates for black people were lower than for the general population, and that as a percentage, there were more skilled black laborers in America, and particularly the American South before the trades were unionized than there have been since. In his view, black Americans were doing a damn fine job on their own of leaving slavery and it's legacies behind before the government started trying to help them.\n\nSo I guess my (hypothetical, I'm not sure how much I agree with Sowell) question to you is, what would undo the legacy of slavery in your view? Here's the conservative perspective on what measures have been implemented thus far: \n\n- 75 years of minimum wage laws have correlated with more poverty and worse job prospects for blacks, particularly young blacks. A higher minimum necessarily reduces the number of low-paying jobs, which are essential to young workers new to the job market. As Milton Friedman said, \"The minimum wage law is most properly described as a law saying employers must discriminate against people who have low skills.\"\n\n- We've had forty years of affirmative action which doesn't seem to have done the trick either. Indeed, it has probably contributed to failure rates among minorities at top universities. An excellent student with the potential to graduate at the top of the class in the fortieth best school in the country is not being done a favor if he or she is artificially accepted into the fifteenth best school and is then outclassed by his or her peers. \n\n- Sixty-odd years of public housing have only bred consistently localized crime and urban decay in poor minority communities. \n\n- The Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s, noble though they were, have made small business owners fear that even the legitimate firing of a minority employee might bring them an ACLU lawsuit they can't afford to fight, deincentivizing them to hire minority employees in the first place and further worsening job prospects. \n\nAll of this adds up to a country where black people have fewer opportunities, opportunities of lower quality, less mobility, and less acceptance by the greater populace than they would without these policies in place. Subsequently they become involved in crime and drugs in greater numbers.\n\nOf course, there has always been persistent racist propaganda, from Nixon's southern strategy, to George H.W. Bush's Willie Horton ad, to Gingrich's \"Kenyan anti-colonialism\" remarks, which use racism to mobilise certain voting blocs, but how effective would that propaganda be without the real life effects of the artificial roadblocks to prosperity listed above? \n\nThe substance of policy in this country has been ostensibly pro-minority for decades, but the measures listed above, enacted by majority-white legislatures in more blatantly racist times than now and hailed as Progressive victories, seem to at least correlate with worsening conditions. Even the war on drugs, the single most transparently bigoted ensemble of legislation we have, was signed into law and then expanded by Progressive heroes Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton, respectively.\n\nThis is not to say that honest-to-god racism and the legacy of slavery don't persist. They do, in all their hideous moral repugnance, and they should not be ignored or downplayed. But they are no longer at the heart of the issues black Americans face. \n\nIn sum, on behalf of the conservatives of this country I would like to change your view that 245 years of racism need to be erased. It isn't for is to erase the past, but to leave it behind, and black Americans have shown themselves more than capable of doing that when the government doesn't interfere.

But it's Hell's Echo Chamber. I spent some time there once.\n\nThere was a stage and I walked onto it from the audience. It was actually the sort of stage you would see on a late night talk show. Not any one particular, or maybe all of them combined. I felt good then, like I was going to do something.\n\nThey weren't ghosts, I'm certain. The ghosts, real ones, they don't take too kindly to me for some reason. Personally, I think it's the same reason I sink and not swim. Anyway, they were something else. Like images of people, or flashes, but I'd say it's more fair to call them traces. Yes, I saw traces of people being interviewed like a late night show. Each one would only last for a few seconds. One lasted too long though, it couldn't be untraced. It got angry and stormed off the stage.\n\nI turned around and looked at the audience. Slowly. The crowd was huge, like a concert. And the sky shone brightly above. I was at a loss for words. I wanted to cry because I could feel them. They gave me such... applause? No, certainly not applesauce, though that's good too. Add a bit of cinnamon. What they gave me was a sense of acceptance.\n\nBut then they split apart. Or was it the black boxes grew? There were stage hands carrying these black boxes that were meant to trap sound. But they pointed them at me instead of the audience. Then they just grew to enormous sizes. Until it became everything.\n\nAt first I could see the material. Velvet, but not like any velvet I've ever seen. But I'm a 'have not', I don't get to see much fancy threads anyway. I knew instinctively that this velvet would absorb sonic waves. Including my voice. I tried to speak and it consumed it. It never let my voice be. It stole the very vibrations from my throat.\n\nI couldn't so much as cry. It would steal those vibrations as well. The darkness became an all-enveloping black shadow over me. It wanted more. It always hungered for me.\n\nThat's my worst fear. I saw it when I peeked behind the curtain to the Land Behind the Land. But I imagine that, true to the nature of this subreddit, I have certainly changed your view. Yes?\n\nWhat do I hope to accomplish? Something positive. I come from a long line of a long lines, carnies, hobos, soldiers, rapists, and drunkards. But me? I'm a cheat.

Not any one particular, or maybe all of them combined. I felt good then, like I was going to do something.\n\nThey weren't ghosts, I'm certain. The ghosts, real ones, they don't take too kindly to me for some reason. Personally, I think it's the same reason I sink and not swim. Anyway, they were something else. Like images of people, or flashes, but I'd say it's more fair to call them traces. Yes, I saw traces of people being interviewed like a late night show. Each one would only last for a few seconds. One lasted too long though, it couldn't be untraced. It got angry and stormed off the stage.\n\nI turned around and looked at the audience. Slowly. The crowd was huge, like a concert. And the sky shone brightly above. I was at a loss for words. I wanted to cry because I could feel them. They gave me such... applause? No, certainly not applesauce, though that's good too. Add a bit of cinnamon. What they gave me was a sense of acceptance.\n\nBut then they split apart. Or was it the black boxes grew? There were stage hands carrying these black boxes that were meant to trap sound. But they pointed them at me instead of the audience. Then they just grew to enormous sizes. Until it became everything.\n\nAt first I could see the material. Velvet, but not like any velvet I've ever seen. But I'm a 'have not', I don't get to see much fancy threads anyway. I knew instinctively that this velvet would absorb sonic waves. Including my voice. I tried to speak and it consumed it. It never let my voice be. It stole the very vibrations from my throat.\n\nI couldn't so much as cry. It would steal those vibrations as well. The darkness became an all-enveloping black shadow over me. It wanted more.

The sergeant in the report himself testified to misrembering the amount of bullets he fired from his gun in another situation. In the high-pressure situations, witness testimony is only so valuable.\n\nThe question is whether the shooting and killing of Michael Brown was unlawful. Brown had no bullet wounds entering his back, only his front. This logically means he was never shot while his back was turned or while he was lying down. Since we know that Brown was shot from the front, we just have to ask if he was holding his arms in the air when he was shot.\n\nThe blood trail shows that even after Brown was shot for the first time, he continued to move toward Wilson. A single bullet will not immediately subdue an attacker, adrenaline may kick in and allow the individual to continue moving. This is an inherent quality in people.\n\nYou may then decide to say that the officer provoked the altercation, which is the one area of contention that is impossible to prove one way or another. The character backgrounds of both the Wilson and Brown however, make it incredibly plausible that Wilson's story leading up to the events of the incident are the truth. (Brown's friend, Darian Johnson claimed that they had been minding their own business when Wilson pulled up to them and after demanding that they move to the sidewalk he drove next to Brown and grabbed him, which resulted in the scuffle by the window.)\n\nIt is far more reasonable that the officer without any previous infractions and and 4 years of exemplary service in this exact neighborhood has more reputable testimony than 2 aggressive individuals who had just physically assaulted and robbed a convenience store. In fact, ignoring any of their previous records, it is likely the two were nervous being approached by an officer right after their crime.\n\nThere are definitely times when officers of the law commit wrongdoings, but this isn't one of them."}, {"id": "cme8clt", "body": "http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/26/7295595/eyewitnesses-ferguson-grand-jury\n\n&gt;many of the witnesses seem to have very contradictory statements (3 state he was kneeling and running while being shot at while another 3 state he charged him while being shot at with his hands up?)\n\n16 claimed he had his hands up at the time he was shot\n7 claimed he was kneeling as he was shot\n\nWhat is the justification for killing Michael Brown?

Using a grand jury is common in controversial cases where the prosecutor wants to hand it off to someone else to decide, but returning a no bill (declining to indict) does not mean that Wilson can never be charged with a crime, because jeopardy is not attached due to GJ proceedings.\n\nEditing to add: I am not a lawyer, btw.

It's the leading cause of wrongful imprisonment and exoneration, especially in rape cases. Police tactics lead to misidentification of the perpatrator, and eyewitnesses have an incredibly fragile memory that can conform to the most convenient option. If a gun-man burst into a classroom and fled, you would get 30 very different descriptions of his appearance from the students.\n\nWith that being said, what happened in Ferguson is great evidence of this. You have a handful of black people claiming they saw Brown with his hands up surrendering. You have another group of them saying he was running away with his back turned. When you look at these groups of people, they're all biased neighbors who are probably fed up with police and wished to make the Michael Brown shooting another case of police violence against unarmed black youth. When we look at the forensic evidence, none of their accounts are true. All of the bullets entered from the front. By recreating the crime scene with forensic science, it was obvious that Brown was the aggressor and that nothing the \"witnesses\" said was true. \n\nThis controversy was fueled by the media and the racist undertones. It's not a matter of black and white, it's a matter of right and wrong. Michael Brown robbed a store, assaulted an innocent clerk, mouthed off to a police officer, attempted to grab a police officers gun, attacked a police officer, and charged a police officer despite MANY warnings to get down. I would hope that whether Michael Brown would have been shot by that officer whether he was black, white, asian, indian, samoan, mexican, etc. And I would hope that that officer would have been acquitted in the name of self defense. Officers risk their lives everyday to protect people. I know that many departments are corrupt, but when there is an intruder in your home, the police will come with guns drawn to take him out and save your life. Why prolong the riots with an expensive, long trial? It was obvious from forensic evidence (the most convincing and legitimate evidence) that Officer Wilson was acting in self defense. If there was a trial, there would be even more time for misinformed, biased media coverage and greater time for egos to boil and people to become angry. When the not guilty verdict finally came back, there would be an even bigger explosion than there is now!

That means, at the time the books are set in the 1990s, these wizards were aware of the \"real\" (non-magical) world of the 1990s- including the many muggle nations with advanced chemical warfare capabilities, high-technology weaponry and access to bombs and bomb-making technology. \n\nBritain, where the \"Harry Potter\" magical world secretly existed in the books, was one of those nations. Why, then, did no wizard ever think to use muggle weapons like bombs and guns to kill Voldemort and his followers? Voldemort would be completely unprepared to deal with, say, a series of bombs being dropped onto his lair as he meets with his top \"Death Eaters.\" Wizards can certainly die of normal causes like fires and explosions, right? Why did no one ever think to do this? Voldemort would have never seen it coming! \n\nAlso, in the books, the \"muggle\" prime minister was once informed by the \"magic\" prime minister of the existence of the magical world, and that a homicidal maniac wizard was running around using magic spells to slay people, not just wizards but \"muggles\" too. UHHH... why does John Major (who would have been the Prime Minister at the time) not suggest that they use some of Britain's advanced weapons or its armed forces to perhaps ambush this lunatic and blow him to smithereens? Or call for help from his close allies in the US, with its even better-oiled war machine ready to roll at any time? This makes no sense. \n\nDoes anyone have an explanation? Is there some sort of wizard code against using muggle weapons? And please don't say \"it's a book, suspend disbelief.\" Hell no I won't suspend disbelief, if you wanna set your book within the real world then it better make sense in that context.\n\nPS. A few more examples- why do wizards use owls to communicate in urgent situations, when owls presumably must takes days to deliver letters across the country/world, and when wizards know of the existence of phones, using which they could instantly communicate with others? Why do they use quills to write when they know of the existence of pens?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The only wizards that seem to have a good grasp on anything muggle related is the muggle borns and half-bloods. Take Arthur Weasly for example. I forget his job-title but he is supposed to be the ministry's expert on muggle tech (if Im remembering correctly.) \n\nThe wizarding world has a long history of seperating themselves from muggles that racism against muggles and part muggles still exists among the full blood families (i.e. mudblood).

He could have used magic to make the guy un-reactionary to the news in that way as well.\n\nTL;DR The wizarding world is still in the process of working thru it's long history of prejudice towards the muggle-kind and therefore still dismisses even the possibility of them being in anyway useful."}, {"id": "2njdwa", "body": "\"Harry Potter\" is supposed to take place in a magical world that exists within our own world, unbeknownst to us non-magical people or \"muggles.\" The \"wizards\" of the magic world, however, know all about the muggles and their world.

That means, at the time the books are set in the 1990s, these wizards were aware of the \"real\" (non-magical) world of the 1990s- including the many muggle nations with advanced chemical warfare capabilities, high-technology weaponry and access to bombs and bomb-making technology. \n\nBritain, where the \"Harry Potter\" magical world secretly existed in the books, was one of those nations. Why, then, did no wizard ever think to use muggle weapons like bombs and guns to kill Voldemort and his followers? Voldemort would be completely unprepared to deal with, say, a series of bombs being dropped onto his lair as he meets with his top \"Death Eaters.\" Wizards can certainly die of normal causes like fires and explosions, right? Why did no one ever think to do this? Voldemort would have never seen it coming! \n\nAlso, in the books, the \"muggle\" prime minister was once informed by the \"magic\" prime minister of the existence of the magical world, and that a homicidal maniac wizard was running around using magic spells to slay people, not just wizards but \"muggles\" too. UHHH... why does John Major (who would have been the Prime Minister at the time) not suggest that they use some of Britain's advanced weapons or its armed forces to perhaps ambush this lunatic and blow him to smithereens? Or call for help from his close allies in the US, with its even better-oiled war machine ready to roll at any time? This makes no sense. \n\nDoes anyone have an explanation? Is there some sort of wizard code against using muggle weapons? And please don't say \"it's a book, suspend disbelief.\" Hell no I won't suspend disbelief, if you wanna set your book within the real world then it better make sense in that context.\n\nPS. A few more examples- why do wizards use owls to communicate in urgent situations, when owls presumably must takes days to deliver letters across the country/world, and when wizards know of the existence of phones, using which they could instantly communicate with others? Why do they use quills to write when they know of the existence of pens?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

He would not be prepared.

Eventually, the muggles would have had to respond, and no wizard seemed to even acknowledge the terrifying weapons capabilities they possessed (think: nukes) when they constantly dismissed them as inferior. \n\nBut the more pressing question to me is why the WIZARD prime minister didn't take advantage of the technology he knew the muggle prime minister possessed; it would have been unorthodox, but they were dealing with a psycho mass murderer and needed some way to get the upper hand.

All of your questions can be explained with 'because magic'. Why don't bombs work? Because magic stops them from exploding. Why don't they use phones or pens? Because if they tried they'd explode in a huge puff of fairy dust and turn nearby wizards into frogs.\n\nThis might sound stupid, made up by me and stink of deus ex machina. That's because it is exactly that. While you mentioned that the suspension of disbelief argument not be used, you can't begin a debate and then immediately take away the main point against you. It's like saying eating only fast food will make you live longer, but don't talk about bad health effects of only eating fast food.\n\nHarry Potter is a childrens book and in order to enjoy it you have to suspend disbelief to some degree. The quota of how much disbelief you can spend varies from person to person. Almost all works of fiction that are set in the 'real world' but in which extraordinary things happen can't be explained without some kind of magic. Do you believe that X-men that generate unbelievable amounts of energy from nowhere by blasting frost/fire/sound/what-have-you from their hands? Do you believe that laser pistols in Star Wars can shoot a roughly 20 cm beam of light that explodes on contact? Do you think that King Arthur really had the ability to pull out Excalibur when men much stronger and skilled than him had already tried? Some works of historical/modern fantasy and science fiction can more intricate and has a stronger case than others. However, in the end all those things can't be explained by traditional reasoning. And that's one of the reasons that we like them.\n\nWhat you are trying to argue is that 'we' are not supposed to believe in Harry Potter because it makes no sense. No, it doesn't - light doesn't emanate from a stick just because the dude holding it concentrated real hard. Harry Potter fans can accept it and enjoy the book/movie. Some of us can't, and don't enjoy it at all. That's fine. However it's important to note that it's an opinion; that disbelief is something solely dependent on 'you'.

You could do a lot of damage. Why not do that?\n\nFor one, neither side really wants to kill people that badly. Voldemort wants to take Britain intact, the ministry is heavily controlled by Pureblood families who don't want to kill all their companions. They both want to kill their opponents, but have no desire to mass murder all the weaker wizards who aren't really a big issue. \n\nSecondly, the stronger wizards who do most of the fighting have immensely powerful spells.

A man basically rampaged through a town for five hours and the local police couldn't do anything because they were unarmed and the nearest armed response squad was forty miles away.

I do however disagree with his method. \n\nI think he should have downloaded the ebook version. The print version has various costs associated with producing and selling it. It is written, edited, typeset, printed, shipped, shelved, and finally sold. The ebook version is written, edited, and typeset, but all the other steps from there are missing. You are thus depriving more specifically the author, publisher, and online distributor of funds without affecting the printing house, the shipping companies, retail associates, and the businesses involved. This is the difference between firing into a crowd and sniping in a field, it is much more targeted and negatively effects only the people you are protesting.

This also applies to the comments. Regardless of what actually happened in Ferguson (which had become more a case of who do you believe rather than actually basing opinions from evidence) there have been many posts using what they believe has happened and is happening to justify racist views. This includes things that have nothing to do with Ferguson for example justifying the killing of Tamir Rice and blaming a 12 year old for his own death (which i cannot find at the moment but will continue looking). General comments about \"thugs\", \"moral integrity\" etc. all whilst in reference to black people. Also a highly upvoted stormfront copy-pasta (which I have found [now](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2ngyrd/in_ferguson_what_officers_are_really_facing_watch/cme04yq) which essentially says that black people commit the most crime whilst implying it has to do with innate characteristics of black people rather than economic factors. Some other similar posts [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2nc5qc/walgreens_looted_and_on_fire_in_ferguson/cmcfjrn) [and(racism clearly doesn't exist!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2nc5qc/walgreens_looted_and_on_fire_in_ferguson/cmcjgac) . [Also (implying the few in ferguson represent black people everywhere)](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2nc5qc/walgreens_looted_and_on_fire_in_ferguson/cmcdsfl) , calling the people in ferguson [\"rabid animals\" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2nc5qc/walgreens_looted_and_on_fire_in_ferguson/cmcedlu). These comments were just from a 5 minute look around from one thread. I've had another look around and [found](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2n0waz/man_tells_it_like_it_is_regarding_shanesha_taylor/cm9k7x9) many more [comments (pretty much all the comments in this thread)](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2nbslo/no_indictment_in_ferguson_case/) like these, not even regarding the Ferguson case. For [example, one poor black woman squandering the money raised for her and her child means no one should ever give any money to a single other poor black women as this shows how \"steretypes come to fruition\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2n0waz/man_tells_it_like_it_is_regarding_shanesha_taylor/cm9i3f5).

And people who have better lawyers will obviously be spared the guilty charge more often. Also, I know here in Britain even though white people are more likely to deal drugs black people are searched more often (about 6x more if I remember correctly). This is why quoting statistics without being able to know the direct causation between the two figures is bs.

Given the racially-charged nature of recent events, it's not at all surprising that you can readily find examples of overt racism, some of which are undoubtedly trolls and others of which are undoubtedly genuine.\n\nBut some of the examples you give are not racist.  They are instead examples of people saying negative or harsh things about people who happen to be black.  For example, it may be unfair or untrue to say that a black 12 year old shot by police with an airsoft gun brought it on himself, but it's not inherently racist.  Likewise, questioning the moral integrity of people breaking into liquor stores and burning down restaurants is not inherently racist.  Calling these things racist is like saying it's racist to call President Obama an idiot. \n\nIn any event, in my experience, you're likely to find substantially more overt racism on other sites based on user-generated content than reddit.
