Now you're forcing someone to do something against their will, because the alternative is economic starvation. Now Libertarians surely support this kind of trapping for some reason, even though some may oppose the monopoly on transportation as stated above.

How about giving those guns to terrorists? At what point are you criminally liable? At what point are you actually supporting the terrorists so much that you are \"involved with the crime\"?

I think a perfectly reasonable definition of aggression is \"to deprive someone of what they are entitled to\". Of course, as your author pointed out, it isn't clear what people are entitled to but that is a separate argument, one that I think libertarians are equipped to win.\n\n\n&gt;Well, I guess that's what just about everyone with different political views disagree on :).\n\nNo, I think that while some people disagree with libertarians because they have different theories of entitlement, I think that the vast majority disagree with libertarianism because they are for aggression in certain cases. Suppose its a time of war, and we can bomb an enemy munitions depot, but doing so would kill 5 innocent civilians, even though most people recognize that those civilians have a right to life, if the munitions depot were sufficiently important (like, it would allow the enemy to murder 1000 civilians), most people would think we should bomb it.

Essentially libertarianism is about property rights, brought to the basest parts and built back up.

People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little.

Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo.

Ie libertarians who support laissez-fair capitalism and private property.\n\nTo my understanding, Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary, mutual agreements.\n\nI am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself (in fact I think it is fine). Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

You claim that the state is giving everyone a chance to leave if they don't like the rules.  While it is true that most modern states do not impose a barrier to exit much higher than paperwork or fuel taxes, this still has several problems.  One is that, at least in america, taxes are owed if you are a citizen, even if you are not in the country.  \n\nAlso, this already assumes that rightful ownership of the land and all people in it belongs to the state, unless such moral assumptions are also granted to literally every crime on earth that limits themselves to a geographic area.  \n\nFurthermore, this argument places the burden of harm on the victim, not the perpetrator.  Anyone that creates a hazard is morally obligated to ensure that nobody is harmed from it.  Nobody can ever get away with digging a spiked pit trap in a public park on the grounds of \"well, their fault for falling in\" for the same reason that it is not justifiable to create a law and jail people on the grounds of \"well, they should have left while they had the chance\".\n\nI do not believe, and have no reason to think that anyone else believes that the \"love it or leave it\" applies to Nuremberg laws, genocide, or the lynchings of black \"reckless eyeballers\" in the american south despite the ability of the victims to leave.  \n\nI am also quite saddened to hear that considered that dodging taxes is \"like refusing your CEO his cut on the profits you made\" (said slightly below u/aristotle2600 's comment).  In the case of the CEO profits, refusing to give him his profits is almost certainly a violation of contract.  When taking a job, you are agreeing to trade produce goods in exchange for money.  By keeping the money AND the goods, you are defrauding someone of what you promised them.  Dodging taxes, on the other hand, can only be considered immoral if you adhere to arguments similar to the \"comply or leave\"."}, {"id": "2n900k", "body": "**edit**: as many pointed out, when I refer to \"libertarians\" in my arguments, I actually mean \"anarcho-capitalists\".

Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, society itself.\n\nOh, but it is fundamentally different. Even the hated Comcast can't come chasing after you with guns and tanks if you decline to buy their service. Government is a bit like the mobster who makes you an offer you can't refuse. There is no opting out. There wasn't even any opting in. They just claimed you as a customer from birth. To get away, you have to drastically change your geography and pay a ransom (which the US just quadrupled in price), and wait a long time for permission to leave. Even if we accept the proposition that taxes are your fee for public services, why do you not get an itemized bill? Why are you asked to ascertain your own debt, based on what *you* produced that year, under threat of armed men coming for you if they think your assessment was inaccurate? Why is what we pay them so disconnected from what they actually spend?\n\nFree humanity is perfectly capable of providing those public services through voluntary means, either through non-profit mutual aid societies or for-profit enterprises. Many of those businesses exist already.\n\n&gt; (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nThe first-past-the-post democratic system produces really awful decisions due to its very design. It forces people to vote against what they perceive to be the worst option, instead of allowing them to choose what they thought was best. The system of entrepreneurship, profit and loss on the other hand, allows people to create multiple solutions to specific problems, each using only the resources of those who think it might be a good idea, and the ideas are ratified or vetoed by the buying public. The market's capability for satisfying human needs outdoes democratic government in speed, accuracy, scope, and nuance.\n\n&gt; If you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country.\n\nAnd that's what they do, when the benefits outweigh the costs. It's funny to hear this argument, because the same people who make it also explode with rage when a business actually follows that advice. Remember those traitors at Burger King? The evil \"outsourcing\" to Mexico and China? The market behaves much like the Internet.

How many modern couples with kids, especially kids younger-than-school-aged, hire babysitters/nannies or get their parents to watch the kids when they are both busy? My estimate is \"all of them\", and further I think the child will bond with those surrogate parents to some degree or another.\n\nPersonally, I don't see how this is different than having close family friends be \"aunt\" and \"uncle\" within a traditional family dynamic, and I hardly think that's uncommon."}, {"id": "cmblx0p", "body": "You said it very well, I'll just add that children spend a lot of time at daycare, kindergarten, school etc. as well.

Who wanted to cuddle whenever you did, who wanted the same things in life, who wanted sex when you did, whose schedule never clashed?\n\nMy counter-question is: why on earth is it considered the norm to expect there to be 1 person to do all that, to whom we pledge our life and faithfulness forever and ever, etc? Imagine if this were applied to *literally* anything else, how absurd it would be. Imagine if, once you'd made a friend, you were expected to only ever hang out with that one friend for the rest of your life. Or just that one drinking buddy, or work at just that one job forever.\n\nNow, there are some differences with relationships and sex, obviously, but the premise still stands. I think everyone has been in some part of a \"love triangle\" at one point or another, and that is caused entirely by this notion that there's this one special person, which just seems absurd when looked at objectively: if there were just one special person, why on earth could someone have feelings for 2 (or more) people at once?\n\nThis has gotten a bit all over the place, but the rub of it is: open relationships/polyamory aren't for everyone, but that doesn't mean they're just for people who are afraid of commitment.

And then you go and compare two completely different things like they are the same. Food isn't sex, just where did you get this retarded idea that you can compare the two?\n\nFirst up, evolution doesn't have a purpose. There's no intent behind the process, no sentience, and so no purpose. The only reasons that exist are in hindsight: there are more of these organisms than there are of those, so these traits will be more common in the gene pool. \n\nAs such, there's no imperative - moral, pragmatic or otherwise - to give a shit what got selected for. If it works for you and nobody gets hurt, who the fuck cares? \n\nAnd second, you seem to have problems with the concept of an analogy. Here's a hint: the point isn't to try and prove that the two things are the same - it's to illustrate parallel reasoning across parallel relationships. \n\nMy partner's sexual exclusivity has no value to me, and so costs me nothing to live without. \n\nThis is a concept you obviously find difficult to relate to; you seem to imagine that I've been somehow manipulated into relinquishing it, and played for a fool thereby. \n\nI get that - different fundamental emotional wiring is *really* hard to wrap your head around.\n\nFor my part, when I try to model the thoughts of jealous people, all I can honestly imagine is deeply insecure, angry people living in a constant state of fear and rage, like those horrible little yappy dogs who are filled with a burning need to defend the mailbox from passers-by. \n\nHowever, I'm assured that it's not like that - and despite the failure of my imagination, I can only assume there's something else there that I'll just never get. \n\nThe analogy to food is just an attempt to give you some insight into the concept of *not caring* about some activity of your partner's, and to try and give you some sense of the bemusement I feel when people insist that I should care, or that I am being harmed. \n\nSuppose you lived in a society that considered *gastronomic* exclusivity to be the bedrock foundation of any real relationship, where catching your partner eating away from home was considered grounds for divorce, maybe even grounds for murder. And suppose that for whatever reason, you just never gave a fuck, and didn't really understand why you should. \n\nThat's not *too* hard to do, as you don't need to imagine a different headspace, just a different society. \n\nNow, in that situation, imagine being yelled at and called a patsy and having your wife insulted (nice touch, that), simply for mentioning that you honestly didn't care where she ate, because to you, it just didn't affect your relationship in the slightest. \n\nIt wouldn't suddenly start making you care where your wife ate, it wouldn't make you feel harmed or manipulated, and it wouldn't make you want to do either of those things. \n\nAnd honestly, the prospect of never getting to feel that she *liked your cooking better*, because it was always just yours or go hungry... would have to be a downer, and the constant fear and anger would have to suck too, so why the fuck would you want this?\n\n*That* is what I was trying to illustrate with the food analogy. The utter bemusement of being yelled at by batshit-insane people about rules you just don't care about. \n\n&gt; [giant wall of yelling] \n\nI don't care.

Instead of one mom, I have two. I still love my real parents just as much, but I love my step-parents too (although slightly less), in essentially the same way. So even the unique relationship that you have with your mom, for some people in some circumstances they can have that relationship with multiple people.\n\nGoing back to the idea of one person fulfilling all your relationship needs: My step-mom is really good at certain things, like teaching me how to dress better; my mom is really good at discussing deep personal issues; my dad is good at physical stuff, like teaching me to build things. I still talk about deep stuff with other parents, for instance, but my mom is just the *best* at it. If my step-mom weren't in my life, my mom could still help with my wardrobe, but she just isn't as good at it, so I'd be missing out.\n\nThis is sorta analogous to how, in my poly relationships, one partner is the best at certain kinds of sex, while another is a fantastic cuddler, and another is great for deep philosophical pillow talk. I still cuddle and have those kinds of sex with other partners, but if I only had one partner, I'd be missing out on the extra quality for activities that partner isn't amazing at.\n\nOne person isn't gonna be fantastic at all the different aspects of a romantic relationship, and they might be downright bad at some. For instance, I've had partners who just don't like philosophical conversations, or sharing gross stories. If that partner is my only partner, I have to either force my partner to do something they dislike, or give up doing it.

She was, and still is, married to her high-school sweetheart. By now they'll have been together at least a decade or two -- longer than most monogamous relationships last.\n\nI can't tell you how meaningful, healthy, or truly intimate their relationship is, but I can tell you that they were happy, and certainly weren't \"waiting for something better to come along\" -- I mean, they were *married,* and still are. And since they've been together longer than so many monogamous marriages, this means that either most monogamous marriages aren't meaningful, healthy, or truly intimate, let alone committed, or it means that it's easy to find open relationships right now that exhibit all of these traits.\n\nIn short: How can a *married* couple be \"commitment phobes\"?\n\nThere are a couple of other things wrong with this:\n\n&gt; I don't see how you can have a meaningful, healthy and truly intimate connection with someone if there is a chance that someone else can 'be' with your significant other in that way.\n\nDo you feel the same way about anything other than sex?\n\nBecause that's really the difference we're talking about here. Suppose I said this:\n\n&gt; Now, I am not jealous or insecure when it comes to my **friendships** but I think that emotionally ~~and definitely physically~~ the connection to one person comes from being with that one person. Not that one person on Thursday, I can still get that other person's number Friday and if I feel like ~~hopping in the bed~~ **hanging out** with someone else that Sunday it's fine.\n\nWell? Do you insist that your friends aren't allowed to have other friends? Imagine how perverse that world would be -- imagine your SO said you aren't allowed to have any other friends, because that would devalue the friendship you two have. I think most people would agree that this is an abusive relationship, right?\n\nWhat about other people you love, in any way that isn't romantic? Suppose your mother insisted that you can't love your father, because then it'd mean you really didn't love your mother. Or the other way around -- when a parent is asked to choose which child they love more, that's literally what Sophie's Choice was all about. And surely you can be intimate with your family?\n\nWe have this idea of a romantic connection that can only happen with one soulmate, but when you take it apart, the *only* thing about that connection that we're actually monogamous about -- at least, if it's a healthy relationship -- is sex. We can love many people, be intimate with many people, go to the movies with many people, have shared secrets with many people, but we're only allowed to kiss one person.\n\nNow, if you can't stand the idea of your SO kissing someone else, it's entirely possible poly isn't for you. And I'm not even saying you're wrong to feel that way. It's not about rationality, about being logical or progressive. Even in poly relationships, people set up rules, and the rules are not always rational, it's about what each person wants out of a relationship.\n\nI'm not saying you should be poly. I'm just trying to draw a circle around how *weird* monogamy is.\n\nAnd I guess this is how I'd try to explain what it's like to have many lovers, and be intimate with all of them. When I went and camped out for the final Lord of the Rings movie, I did it with some very good friends, and for those two hours, we (and the movie) were all that mattered. I didn't spend the whole time thinking about how much better it'd be if Bob was there -- Bob wasn't as much into movies as he was into tinkering with electronics, so we did that instead. And when I built a transistor radio with Bob, I wasn't thinking about what movies were on. The experience isn't diminished because I have other friends that I do other things with, and it's not a competition about who's the most fun to hang out with.\n\nWouldn't it be weird if we managed our friendships the way most people manage their relationships? Or, at the very least, can you see how it's possible to be just as good friends with Bob, even though I'm also friends with Alice, and maybe romantically involved with Eve?"}, {"id": "2n8psp", "body": "I'd like to think I am a pretty logical and progressive person.

I definitely changed.\n\nFor the record, I'm polyamorous.  This means I can be in loving, committed, romantic relationships with multiple people at a time, and my lovers can too.  So I'm going to come at it from that perspective.\n\nI remember a long time ago thinking as you do.  A girl once asked me to be in an open relationship, and I said I'd rather not, as I'd just be looking for a replacement for her the whole time.  It didn't seem stable, really.\n\nThen, due to a strange set of circumstances, I found myself dating two women at once (both knew about each other, of course).  I was stunned by how natural this felt.  I didn't love either one less, nor was I feeling a desire to chose between them.  It was as natural as having two parents, or two close friends, or two children.  You don't love one less, in fact you sort of love each one more.  There's less expectation on each... I don't have to sit there thinking \"okay, I like her, but does she fulfill absolutely every desire in a relationship that I'll ever have until the end of time?\"  Instead, it's just \"do I like being with this person, do I care about her, and does she feel the same about me?\"\n\nPretty soon, you start to realize that sex and romance aren't off in some special categories, unlike all other interpersonal relationships, such that they and they alone must be unique in your life while all others can be shared.  There's no point to it.  I'm not looking for someone better to come long... rather, I'm looking to add more people to my close family, as it were.  Love's not a race to be won wherein you try to get the best trophy and put it in your closet for all time.  Love's about building trust and love with people.  There's no reason to do this only with one person.\n\nAnd I'm not at all afraid of commitment.  I have no problem sitting down discussing retirement plans together.  Nor am I thinking about replacing any of them with a better model, as though women were all on some scale and I'm looking for the one with the highest number of girlfriend points.  I just enjoy being with them, and hope to be with them for a very long time.\n\nSo, right now I have three girlfriends.  Each is lovely in her own way.  Some are more serious than others, but each relationship can develop as it will.  One of my girlfriends is with another man, who's married to yet another woman, and while I'm sure that sounds strange as hell to most, I found I don't worry about that at all.  He seems pretty cool, actually.  I don't think of metamors (that's a lover of your lover, btw) as competition or threats or people who might replace me... rather as co-conspirators that can help me plan really awesome surprise birthday parties for my lovers.\n\nNobody really replaces anybody, for me.  Heartbreak at losing a lover still hurts just as badly, even when another lover is right there to comfort me.  Getting a new lover doesn't replace the old at all, it's just another person, just as getting a new friend doesn't replace a lost best friend.  But now that I've been doing this a while, I've found I don't lose lovers nearly so badly anymore.  I was just last night hanging out with my ex of 8 years.  I still love her.  And that's okay.  And yes, my girlfriends know that, and that's fine with them too.  I don't have to pretend to be over her either.  They're not competing with her, after all.  Love's not a competition, it's a family.\n\nSo that's one type of open relationship to consider.  Yes, I can technically sleep with whoever I want.  No, I don't actively seek new partners for the most part.  They just sort of happen.  It's nice.  But there's no phobia of commitment here.  I like the idea of settling down with someone for the long haul... and maybe also someone else.  I'm moving in with my girlfriend of a year and a half soon.  \n\nAlso the threesomes rock, so there's that."}, {"id": "cmbnpay", "body": "I used to think that way.

There's no point to it.  I'm not looking for someone better to come long... rather, I'm looking to add more people to my close family, as it were.  Love's not a race to be won wherein you try to get the best trophy and put it in your closet for all time.  Love's about building trust and love with people.  There's no reason to do this only with one person.\n\nAnd I'm not at all afraid of commitment.  I have no problem sitting down discussing retirement plans together.  Nor am I thinking about replacing any of them with a better model, as though women were all on some scale and I'm looking for the one with the highest number of girlfriend points.  I just enjoy being with them, and hope to be with them for a very long time.\n\nSo, right now I have three girlfriends.  Each is lovely in her own way.  Some are more serious than others, but each relationship can develop as it will.  One of my girlfriends is with another man, who's married to yet another woman, and while I'm sure that sounds strange as hell to most, I found I don't worry about that at all.  He seems pretty cool, actually.  I don't think of metamors (that's a lover of your lover, btw) as competition or threats or people who might replace me... rather as co-conspirators that can help me plan really awesome surprise birthday parties for my lovers.\n\nNobody really replaces anybody, for me.  Heartbreak at losing a lover still hurts just as badly, even when another lover is right there to comfort me.  Getting a new lover doesn't replace the old at all, it's just another person, just as getting a new friend doesn't replace a lost best friend.  But now that I've been doing this a while, I've found I don't lose lovers nearly so badly anymore.  I was just last night hanging out with my ex of 8 years.  I still love her.  And that's okay.  And yes, my girlfriends know that, and that's fine with them too.  I don't have to pretend to be over her either.  They're not competing with her, after all.  Love's not a competition, it's a family.\n\nSo that's one type of open relationship to consider.  Yes, I can technically sleep with whoever I want.  No, I don't actively seek new partners for the most part.  They just sort of happen.  It's nice.  But there's no phobia of commitment here.  I like the idea of settling down with someone for the long haul... and maybe also someone else.  I'm moving in with my girlfriend of a year and a half soon.  \n\nAlso the threesomes rock, so there's that."}, {"id": "cmcbzw3", "body": "&amp;#8710;\n\nI don't want to be a slutty delta giver but on yours I had to.

Since you brought up jealousy and it is an important topic to address I want to try to give you some insight how it works for me. A lot of people seem to think that if you live in an open relationship you can't be a jealous person, but that's not really the case. I for example would totally be jealous if my girlfriend dumped me and I see her with somebody else the next day, but during the relationship there is no need for jealousy. I trust my girlfriends love and I don't see why she should love me less because of sex. I know for myself that sleeping with others doesn't change the way I feel about her, so why should it change the way she feels for me? Her capability to feel the same towards me has brought us closer together than I could have ever dreamed of and the way she trusts me makes me the happiest person.\n\n&gt; I don't see how you can have a meaningful, healthy and truly intimate connection with someone if there is a chance that someone else can 'be' with your significant other in that way. \n\nI'm not really sure what everyone is supposed to understand as meaningful and healthy. Everybody has to decide for themselves, if the relationship they are having is meaningful to them, because you can't judge it objectively. That would be like someone telling you his favorite food is chocolate ice cream and you tell him that he is wrong. I goggled some definition for \"healthy relationship\" and this is what the National Domestic Violence Hotline writes (other websites I found were pretty similar but this was better formated for copying it here :) )\n\nFor both partners applies:\n\n    *1  Treat each other with respect\n    *2  Feel supported to do things they like\n    *3  Don\u2019t criticize each other\n    *4  Allow each other to spend time with friends and family\n    *5  Listen to each other and compromise\n    *6  Share some interests such as movies, sports, reading, dancing or music\n    *7  Aren\u2019t afraid to share their thoughts and feelings\n    *8  Celebrate each other\u2019s accomplishments and successes\n    *9  Respect boundaries and do not abuse technology\n    *10 Trust each other and don\u2019t require their partner to \u201ccheck in\u201d\n    *11 Don\u2019t pressure the other to do things that they don\u2019t want to do\n    *12 Don\u2019t constantly accuse each other of cheating or being unfaithful\n\nPoint 12 isn't even a point in an open relationship and the rest is not connected to the style of your relationship. Some persons, myself included, will probably find number 7 easier in an open relationship, but I'm sure there are just as many who feel the contrary.\n\nA truly intimate connection is nothing that is solely formed in bed. I know about my partners vulnerabilities and she knows about mine. In monogamous relationships there is a lot of black and white (i.e. attraction to you SO good, but to others bad) whereas in an open relationship a lot of these areas are gray. By allowing my SO to sleep with others she has to decide and I trust her with this. The same goes the other way around. Trusting the other with this much power over each other is what I call a truly intimate connection.\n\n&gt;Not that one person on Thursday, I can still get that other person's number Friday and if I feel like hopping in the bed with someone else that Sunday it's fine.\n\nHaving an open relationship doesn't mean you go around humping everyone that doesn't say no.

On one side you have pure monogamy, then open relationships, then all the way to polyamory. \n\nWhen you view relationships as simply a means to an end (monogamous marriage), then it's very easy to see open relationships as simply being afraid to commit. However, that's a great way to end up unhappy if you have poly leanings. The goal of any relationship should be to be greater than the sum of the individual people in them. \n\nFor some, they simply do not want commitment and will have many boyfriends and/or girlfriends. If commitment makes them unhappy or uncomfortable, why make noncommitmemt a negative thing? For others (like myself), they'll have a primary that is very much like a committed marriage, and other relationships on the side that serve to enhance the primary. \n\nFor example, my wife is very kinky and bisexual. I'm not nearly as kinky as she is and I'm a man. So she has a girlfriend that she does kink with, and we swing with a few others from time to time. I'll admit that it takes a LOT of trust and communication to overcome the jealousy, but in the end our relation is enhanced and we're much happier than if we were stuck with only each other.\n\nThere is yet a third kind where all 3 or more partners share \"primary\" status. I can't offer much personal insight into the relationship aspect, but I can sure as hell see the logistical benefits. Imagine a household with 3 incomes?

It's because I understand I can't meet every one of his needs.\n\nIt's unreasonable to think anyone can meet every single one of my needs, and vice versa.  I also recognize that my husband is not brain dead just because there's a ring on his finger.  Him and I are into different things just as much as we are into the same things.  He's attracted to other types of women, other body types, etc etc.\n\nBy allowing him to go out and date other women (within the confines of the boundaries him and I have both agreed to), he has a much more fulfilled life, which leads to him being able to love me deeper and more fully because he's genuinely happy.  It feeds the cycle of trust and love, and strengthens our marriage.\n\nAnd because him and I have open communication, and because he makes it very clear to these women that I'm his priority and they don't have a snowball's chance in hell of 'replacing me', it helps weed out the girls that will enhance his life vs try to destroy it for their own personal gain.\n\nIt works because him and I trust each other completely, and because of that trust, I can allow him to explore things with others that I probably wouldn't be willing to do.  Like I said, it means his life is a lot more fulfilled than it would be with just me, and I'm more fulfilled because I don't have to do things I genuinely don't enjoy.\n\nIt's not for everyone, and that's ok.

Honestly, I don't know what it would take to persuade you, but from this side of the fence, I sincerely can no longer see how my partners spending time with other people really hurts the intimacy I feel with them. \n\nOther people have already covered it: you just have to learn to appreciate that you can't give your partner everything. Letting my partners supplement their emotional lives by having \"friends with benefits\" has been nothing but good for me. \n\nI guess you can call it a failure if you *really* want to rationalize it, since that 15-year relationship I mentioned ended when my boyfriend decided to break up with me and date the guy he was seeing on the side. But you know... we're both still really good friends. Most closed relationships don't even last that long, and when they fail, they tend to come with a lot of ugly fallout. I'm really grateful I didn't fall for the bullshit that you have to hate your ex.\n\nNope, sorry, this \"bullshit\" of open relationships has brought me nothing but happiness. Yeah, you're basically raising the difficulty level of your relationship -- managing multiple people's emotional states is freakin' HARD -- but if you can pull it off and learn to get over the possessiveness, it is totally worth it.

Not that one person on Thursday, I can still get that other person's number Friday and if I feel like hopping in the bed with someone else that Sunday it's fine.

Not everybody is looking for \"meaningful\" and \"truly intimate connection\". \"Healthy\" is a bit of a leading evaluation in that it is a conclusion about what is good for people from your point of view, rather than an independent measure or from their own point of view.\n\nBut also it doesn't fit your title. Your title says\n\n&gt; I think 'open' relationships are for commitment phobes waiting for something better to come along that don't want to be alone in the interim.\n\nEven if you could demonstrate that a relationship wasn't meaningful, healthy, or an intimate connection, you still haven't proven your title statement. To be a \"commitment phobe\" says they are *scared* of commitment. What if people truly and honestly don't *want* a commitment?\n\nI won't even say you are explicitly wrong so much as you are starting from the wrong evaluation criteria and approach to thinking about it. Let me re-frame it in the context of my story.\n\nIn my first marriage I settled. I committed to somebody *because* I thought I wouldn't do any better, and I was a bit afraid of being alone. It was a bad marriage for 9 years, and she cheated on me. I eventually left her.\n\nI then spent some time to re-frame myself. I decided to improve myself, become confident in being alone, become confident in dating women, and being happy in life. I had no plan or interest whatsoever in finding somebody to marry, become intimate with. I was truly very happy. I dated many women, sometimes 5 or 6 different ones in a week. I got really good at attracting quality women over time. I was honest and up-front about not looking for lasting relationships. For those looking for more we just moved on. Often it was only 1 date and we knew that was it. Others would go for a few weeks/dates and that was it. A few lasted months, all still open and non-committed to anything other than enjoying each other's time. (Yes, often with sex. It shouldn't be surprise that even women often enjoy sex without commitment with a genuinely good person, but a time in their life they don't want to be tied down. Same here.)\n\nAll of these were amicable splits, or \"fade away\" in some cases where we got busy with other people and slowly stopped seeing each other. Years later I'm still friends with some of them, and I don't mean just listed as a facebook friend.\n\nOne of these completely casual dates turned into something more. After a few dates together, and a whirlwind romance, I wasn't interested in looking for other dates. Neither was she. A few months in and we completely committed to each other. Neither of us were looking for it, nor relying on it, nor scared. We fell in love, deeply. The next year I proposed. We've been married almost 6 years, with 2 kids, and I love her as much now as when we fell in love.\n\nSo did I fit this scenario? It was fear that made me commit to my first wife, not avoid commitment after her. The open relationships were fun and mutual. None of us were looking for anything \"better\" to come along, but if it did we moved on. Nothing wrong with that as we all knew it was what we had. And no plan to commit or fall in love; it happened on it's own without looking or being forced.\n\nHealthy? I would say dating many people is as healthy as it gets; you know what works, what doesn't, and aren't kept with a bad connection due to some sort of commitment (like I was for 9 years). I was happy without a meaningful, \"truly intimate\" relationship and didn't need it. But it did come along. And it came along even though I wasn't looking for it. (I wasn't *against* it. That's different.)\n\nSo I think you've got some pre-conceived notions about commitment being some correct state of existence that we should all be seeking. In fact, I think that it causes as much damage, when with the wrong person, as it does to solidify the connection with the right one. Looking for something better to come along is a healthy thing if, in fact, it doesn't feel right to be fully committed to the person you are with. As long as everybody agrees on this, where is the problem? I think I did it right. Where do you feel I did it wrong?\n"}, {"id": "2n8psp", "body": "I'd like to think I am a pretty logical and progressive person. However.

Mind you, I felt no less love for the person I was in a committed relationship with and I never would have acted upon those feelings. It was painful for me, but I'm not one of those people that gets off on illicit romance and cheating.\n\nWhen I learned about open relationships (I was single at the time), I realized that it was the only relationship style that really resonated with me. \n\nToday, I have a very committed partner and we've been happily together for about seven years now. We live together, share a bank account, and he's on my insurance. I genuinely believe that we will be together for years more, maybe even for life. I have also had long-term romantic relationships outside of this one. My last partner lasted three years, ended amicably, and is someone that I consider one of the closest and best friends I have ever had. \n\nI have recently started dating another person and I could definitely see it becoming long-term. It's been a little over three months since we began seeing each other and we haven't yet had sex, so the sexytimes on the side thing is pretty much ruled out. I'm definitely smitten with this guy and suspect that it could even become love pretty easily at this point. As for his existing relationships, he has a wife and child, and they live with his wife's committed partner. They are very much a family and I feel completely welcomed and cared about in their home. \n\nThe point is, I guess, that this has in no way changed my relationship with my live-in partner (I refer to him as my anchoring partner).

Mind you, I felt no less love for the person I was in a committed relationship with and I never would have acted upon those feelings. It was painful for me, but I'm not one of those people that gets off on illicit romance and cheating.\n\nWhen I learned about open relationships (I was single at the time), I realized that it was the only relationship style that really resonated with me. \n\nToday, I have a very committed partner and we've been happily together for about seven years now. We live together, share a bank account, and he's on my insurance. I genuinely believe that we will be together for years more, maybe even for life. I have also had long-term romantic relationships outside of this one. My last partner lasted three years, ended amicably, and is someone that I consider one of the closest and best friends I have ever had. \n\nI have recently started dating another person and I could definitely see it becoming long-term. It's been a little over three months since we began seeing each other and we haven't yet had sex, so the sexytimes on the side thing is pretty much ruled out. I'm definitely smitten with this guy and suspect that it could even become love pretty easily at this point. As for his existing relationships, he has a wife and child, and they live with his wife's committed partner. They are very much a family and I feel completely welcomed and cared about in their home. \n\nThe point is, I guess, that this has in no way changed my relationship with my live-in partner (I refer to him as my anchoring partner). We still have sex the same amount, cuddle and watch movies, do chores together, and even bicker about the little things just as much. It takes nothing away from us and he is actually my closest confidante and best friend.

So much so, that I thought it obviously must make sense for us to get married!\n\nBut I was only 19.  I was really too young, and caught up way too much from being in love for the first time.\n\nI was thankfully talked out of going through with it, and came to agree that it was way too early in life to get married when so much could still change for me.  And I hadn't ever had any experience with anyone else to compare to.  But I still loved the guy.  Why should I break up with him just cause I wasn't ready to get married yet?\n\nAt this point, I broached the subject of an open relationship, which I was just starting to learn about from all these fabulous things I was reading on the internet.  We had a long-distance relationship as well, from being away at uni, which made things even harder for us.  So I honestly encouraged him to pursue other opportunities if they came along, and told him that I wouldn't be bothered by it.  If he'd successfully found one, I would have been seriously happy for him.  I figured there were good odds he'd still see me as the \"primary\", and if not, well - if he found someone near him that he liked even better than me so he no longer wanted to stay committed to me, then it was probably for the best.  I still loved him and our rare times together, and had long calls with him constantly, but the distance was clearly taking a toll on him.  And I was excited by my new life at uni and up for trying something new.\n\nI didn't really get the chance to test out if this would work, though.  Selling the idea was very awkward since it came up after I'd been \"talked down\" from marriage, and we ended up breaking up instead.  I wished I had known about this option all along, and followed it from the start, instead of falsely getting his hopes up with the idea of marriage.  I wished we could have known going in that we were young and it was okay to try and play the field a bit without it having to ruin the very meaningful relationship we had.  I think we could have eventually parted then on better terms.\n\nSo I think for young people especially, open relationships can be a much healthier option while you still have a lot of room to grow.

Even at different times? Probably, right? So what's-- not just for you, but for *everyone*, what's the time limit that needs to be passed after one relationship before that intimacy \"counts\" for the second? Isn't it possible you could have had those feelings for both people concurrently? Loving one doesn't mean you love the other any less.\n\nAnd it's all up to the person to decide what's right for them. Some people don't feel, or don't want, to share their SO that way.

That no one is capable of sharing themselves or their partner that way? I don't think that's true.\n\nI think it becomes an easy excuse when people are younger and don't want to get too committed, want to see what else is out there. And that's okay.

My relationship with my GF is good. We're happy, we're going to move in together soon, and I see it lasting a long time. But we have sex with other people. That's it, just sex. No strings attached - we have very clear rules on that. \n\nIt has nothing to do with commitment. We're committed. We want to settle down together. The thing is, this sexual attraction towards other people does not go away just because you're emotionally involved in a relationship. As I've described to a friend before, I'm madly in love, not dead from the waist down. And for obvious reasons, this is the same for her. So we talked about it and decided on an open relationship, because it's fun to give in to your desires, it's exciting to have sex with new people, and quite frankly the idea of a single sexual partner for what may be the rest of our lives seems incredibly boring in the long run. \n\nAnd you know what? It works for us. She comes home with new tricks she's learned. I come home all happy and giddy from a \"date\" with a hot friend, and the next week my libido is through the roof because I've tried something new. It works. It makes us happy. If anything, it will help this relationship last, instead of having it break up due to inevitable frustrations.

Despite being single, I consider it to be an honor to be my girlfriend, and it is something a girl will need to work for.

That is out of your control.  You can promise to stay with them, which is what I presume you mean.\n\n* People make those sorts of promises all the time, and break them all the time.   Surely you are aware of this, and your partner as well.   You may trick yourself into believing otherwise, but the fact remains, you can leave your partner and he or she can leave you.  Relationships are little more than weak verbal contracts that are completely unenforceable.  Or your SO can get ran over by a bus.  There are no assurances against change, to believe such is to believe a delusion.\n\n* You can commit, and you can also add a layer of enforcement that can be used against you should you try to leave e.g. marriage.  But why would you do this?  If you really want to be with the person, you can be with them without this legal construct that can only be used to compel you and your partner to stay in a relationship against their will.  Imagine two people who were*supremely confident* that they were going to stay with each other their entire lives.  If you asked them if they were going to get married or make a public commitment, they would not understand why--what's the point, they would wonder.  The only time such commitment (or the enforcement of such a pledge) would come into play is if one of them didn't want to be in the relationship any longer, but at that point....why *should* the relationship continue?  What good can come out of two people staying together because of a commitment that was made in the past, a broken relic of what was once a wonderful relationship.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2n8psp", "body": "I'd like to think I am a pretty logical and progressive person.

People crave recognition and respect, and therefore: people with STEM degrees will receive more recognition and respect than non-STEM degrees.\n\nPlease let me know if I've misunderstood your view.\n\nSo, a couple of things. First, there is a point of 'diminishing returns' when it comes to income and happiness, and [it happens right around $75,000k/year.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-10-things-economics-can-tell-us-about-happiness/257947/) Factors like marriage satisfaction and health have a much greater effect on happiness than income, and the 'keeping up with the Joneses\" effect means that making median income among your peers (even if those peers are all high-earners) creates much less happiness than excelling. In short, you'll be happier making $50k as a theater actor than $100k as an engineer. \n\nIn terms of social recognition, I agree that a medical professional or a SpaceX scientist will be more respected by his peers than a failed writer or an waitressing actress. But STEM is a large field and it encompasses many fields and professions that society *doesn't* respect or celebrate. I wouldn't be surprised if a Lockheed engineer or a PornHub sysadmin has been given the cold shoulder at a dinner party once or twice, or if a low-paid inner-city teacher has been celebrated and praised. By the same token, there are fields that don't fall into liberal arts or STEM that are both celebrated and reviled. Law comes readily to mind: I have a friend who is a state prosecutor who works with child sex crimes who is a hero to many of our peers, and another (acquaintance) who is a personal injury attorney and is widely understood to be a bottom-feeding scumbag. The personal injury attorney makes much more money than the state prosecutor, but the prosecutor is the one who gets invited to our parties. \n\nI think the heart of the matter is: it's much easier to achieve a degree or certification in the arts without being particularly talented, whereas STEM degrees naturally weed out the non-dedicated and untalented. But, as you said in your OP, talented liberal arts degree holders and professionals do just fine professionally, and (in doing what they love) achieve a degree of income and social recognition that put them on par with STEM professionals.
