It's kind of a dorky shirt, but hey, I don't judge.  It's probably not appropriate for your TV interviews as a representative of the scientists that just put a rover on a comet, but again, your choices are yours.

It's kind of a dorky shirt, but hey, I don't judge.  It's probably not appropriate for your TV interviews as a representative of the scientists that just put a rover on a comet, but again, your choices are yours.  But the backlash against this poor guy was such that he apologized, crying, for ever daring to wear the thing.  He was lambasted and belittled, all for daring to have zero fashion sense.\n\nThis seems utterly ridiculous to me, and also, I feel, presents something of a double standard.

In my eyes, that's hypocrisy at it's height, and I do not approve.  Our movement is supposed to be about equality, not about bullying.  \n\n\nI would love for you to explain why I'm wrong.\n\nEDIT:  I have to head to bed, but thanks for the great answers so far!

It isn't a difficult concept to grasp, but if you can't open your mind to it then no one else can. It's about the assumptions people make about gender and it goes right down into the way we're socialised. They're not explicitly and overtly sexist, but there part of how we were all brought up. Just as an example, female and male babies are treated differently. They did an experiment where they dressed babies in opposite gender clothing and then they had adults interact in various tasks. One task was the adults had to choose the gradient of a ramp that they believed the babies could crawl down. The ramp was higher for babies the adults thought were male, but lower for babies they thought were female. They also had them play with toys. Adults picked out gender specific toys depending on who they thought they were playing with. But it wasn't just a matter of selecting that toy, but they also 'saw' that the baby reacted differently towards the toy. For instance, they thought the boy babies (who were dressed in girl clothes) 'eyes lit up' when they played with dolls.

The reaction that a woman would have received is irrelevant.  He is a member of a field for which the demographics are extremely male dominated. That demographic domination isn't by chance.  This is the case for a variety of reasons, but a big one is that women are inherently treated differently than men in scientific fields. The overall lack of awareness exhibited by the overwhelming male majority is one such issue that was demonstrated very clearly in this case. The fact that neither Taylor nor anyone he worked with thought that maybe he shouldn't be wearing that shirt on television (to say nothing of just not wearing it to work) indicates that maybe they aren't as self aware as they should be. \n\nFor a woman to be seen in that shirt she 1) would have had to have been employed by the Rosetta team and 2) been given the opportunity to be on television by her superiors.  That combination of things didn't happen. And even if both of those things had happened and a woman had been wearing that shirt, it wouldn't have spoken quite so clearly to the level of subconscious and unintentional sexism that is exhibited by the scientific community. \n\nTo put a finer point on it, the difference in public reaction to a white guy wearing a shirt with the word \"Nigger\" written on it and a black guy wearing the same shirt would be quite large. I would go so far as to say that you wouldn't be surprised by the difference in reaction either.  I'll take it a step further and say that you wouldn't think that the difference in reaction is \"ridiculous\" or a \"double standard\" (or if you do, I think you are wrong, but that's another story entirely).

I find my wife sexy, but I also care about the day she had at work.\n\n&gt; If anything it means you are humanizing them.\n\nThis is irrational.  It does not compute.

No. If you really think that humans only exist as things to be fucked and that the ability to have sex is all that makes us human then I don't think this conversation can be particularly fruitful for either of us.\n\n&gt;Also, if you are going to say, \"people fuck flesh lights all the time,\" that is not the same thing.\n\nI agree, it's not the same thing, because flesh lights aren't actually people with wants and desires of their own that can be ignored in favor of just fucking them.\n\n&gt;People are fantasizing about sexy female humans when they are using a flesh light.\n\nYes, they are."}, {"id": "cm346up", "body": "&gt; Similarly, a man working in a field commonly criticized for misogyny wears a shirt with busty anime characters plastered all over it at a professional event, that's more insensitive than a woman doing the same thing.\n\nExcept wearing clothes with sexy women on it isn't misogyny.

It's also unfortunate that the ESA apparently doesn't seem to think that a shirt (or a cubicle, or a computer wallpaper) decorated with mostly nude women is something to bat an eye over, because he could have been saved from this embarrassment.
