Go meet some sex-positive people.  If you above the age of consent, find a sex shop that runs workshops or look for sex-positive meetups.  You'll meet lots of people who are fans of physical pleasure with no guilt, no pressure, and confidence and clarity in what they want, enjoy and are comfortable with sexually, plus, they tend to really enjoy helping others explore those things for themselves.\n\n\nWant to find a relationship?  Start working on your view of women (I'm assuming that you're straight, based on your post) as people, not prizes to be won, strange or mysterious creatures, treasures or trash.  Think of them as the other players in your MMORPG, rather than NPCs (to cite my favorite analogy from another redditor).  As a woman, there is almost nothing that concerns, and I'd venture to say even scares me more when I'm spending time with a new guy than finding out that he's into pickup artistry or TRP--it means that he thinks of me as an achievement and an object to be controlled through his social experimentation, not a person.  \n\nIt's easy, having been through what feels like endless rejection, to want to solve the problem.  But the best things you can do are to work on yourself--your confidence (through your own achievements and interests--do things!  You will have things to talk about and new people to meet!), your health, both physical and mental (working out is great for your brain as well as your body), and your respect and empathy for other people (try volunteering--again, you'll meet people and be doing good for your community or cause).  It sounds crazy, but when you get engaged in those sorts of things, you become much more clear in what you want from others without performing the character you think you need to be to receive it.  You're also more likely to meet others who share those views and appreciate them in their partners.\n\nI think it's admirable that you are recognizing that these patterns could be destructive and are actively trying to shift your perspective, and I wish you the best."}, {"id": "cm6ign1", "body": "If that were true, The Red Pill wouldn't be almost universally reviled."}, {"id": "cmc1j9p", "body": "Lol it's not universally reviled, it's one of the 100 most active subreddits on this massively mainstream website."}, {"id": "2mptvb", "body": "NOTE: those is not the stereotypical whiny \"I'm a nice guy why don't girls like me\" post.

My entire life I was the stereotypical \"nice guy\" who always cared about the feelings of others, so much so that I would invite kids sitting alone at lunch to my table, I would hang out with my friends if they seemed like they needed someone to talk to, etc. \n\nMy mom instilled in me from a very young age that above all I should respect women and that was the way to find love. Hold the door open for her, be polite and courteous,buy her flowers, etc. Anyways, last year I met what seemed like the perfect girl. Beautiful, funny, ditzy, intelligent, basically everything I could ever want in a girl. Back then I believed there was a distinction between party rats and nice girls, and she seemed to embody essentially everything about the \"nice girl\". Well we made plans to hang out one night and she flaked on me. Then I found out the reason that she flaked: to fuck the football teams 5th string running back who was known around campus as a player and had fucked like 10 girls already (first 2 months of college). I stopped talking to her after that. As soon as she found a \"better option\" she just left me in the dust and never showed any regret for ditching me.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is this: most girls I have met in college have behaved this way. Even the ones I would never expect it from, and the ones who said they \"weren't that girl\" and \"wanted a nice guy\". I used to laugh at nice guys on the internet but now I really feel for them. I'm not ugly by any means and I've had a little success but it was only when I pretended to be someone who I'm not and basically acted like the girl didn't exist until the night we hooked up. I HATE acting like this but based on my experiences it seems like the only way. Do women really hope to find a nice guy? Because I'm calling bullshit. Change my view.\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone who replied (even the people who called me a terrible person, controlling, literally hitler, etc.). Through all of your comments I slowly started to see how silly my point of view was. One comment really put it into perspective so I gave her a delta.

You broke off your friendship because she slept with a guy you don't approve of instead of hanging out with you. That's a really strong reaction. Friends occasionally flake out or do inconsiderate things. We all get over it and move on. What she did was not \"downright nasty\".\n\n&gt; If you had been talking to a girl for weeks and had a strong connection with them and they ditch you to fuck some known player would that not irk you a little bit? Wouldn't that be just a bit unethical on her part?\n\nI'd be disappointed sure. But the only unethical part about what she did was ditching you (and \"unethical\" is a big stretch there). The fact that she did it to go sleep with somebody is completely inconsequential. If she had said \"hey, I'm not going to be able to hang out tonight\" and then gone off to sleep with some guy then she would have done literally nothing wrong. Having a connection with somebody for a few weeks **does not** give you the right to police their sexual choices. \n\nPlease take this seriously because this sort of thing is going to happen to you again in the future.

He buys me flowers for no reason, he's always polite, he does nice things for his friends, like helping them move, and he help my parents with their computer/smartphone problems.

It just shouldn't be happening. It's not really appropriate in general. Keep it out of school altogether.\n\n**This was the point I was getting at **\n___\n\nI think it's wrong for us to force young children to say the Pledge of Allegiance and devote themselves to a country that they don't understand. If voting turnouts are proof enough, even a lot of the adult population doesn't know a lot about or care a lot about the current government and all the policies and controversies, let alone a child who has likely not yet been taught about all the ins and outs. To me, this is what I hear when children say the pledge:\n\n&gt;I *(a child incapable of comprehending the meaning of these words, nor their implication, or the actions of the leaders for which they speak)* Pledge Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands *(and even if I don't, I'll be legally bound to sign my life to service in a draft against my will under the Selective Service System, and may have it done so without my knowledge through my high school)* one nation under God *(whom I am forced to recognize here, even though we are not a Christian nation, and I may have been atheist and may still be if it weren't for indoctrination before the age of reason, or perhaps am not of a monotheistic faith and therefore would not subscribe to devoting myself under a single God)*, indivisible *(not counting the Civil War...)*, with liberty and justice for all *(so long as you're not a woman, minority, immigrant, or homosexual... basically you're fine if you're a 'Merican born rich white man)* \n\nNow, I'm not trying to be \"mean\" to children and say they cannot possibly be told about these things, and perhaps have some basic grasp of the troubles. I'm saying that they aren't taught, and can't be asked to understand the depth or breadth of the issues at hand. I'm not saying they are incapable of a basic concept of grief or strife. They could surely understand sorrow. But to grasp the complex legal and social ramifications of pledging themselves to a nation as large as America... is ridiculous. I don't think a child is capable of comprehending the NSA stealing our information, the implications of wars we've started on the lies of our leaders... I'm sure they don't know about the government being convicted of the murder of MLK, or how we've kept people in internment camps... I'm sure they're unaware of the murders, bombings, and lynchings that have gone unpunished because of our legal system. How right after this pledge, their fathers still can't be married because it's an abomination to a select group's ideals.... There's a level of indoctrination involved with altogether disturbing consequences. Such as the Bellamy Salute, which you don't see us doing any more, we put our hands over our hearts now because we know that doing it like it used to be would imply similarity to totalitarian fascist regimes like Nazi Germany.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If voting turnouts are proof enough, even a lot of the adult population doesn't know a lot about or care a lot about the current government and all the policies and controversies, let alone a child who has likely not yet been taught about all the ins and outs. To me, this is what I hear when children say the pledge:\n\n&gt;I *(a child incapable of comprehending the meaning of these words, nor their implication, or the actions of the leaders for which they speak)* Pledge Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands *(and even if I don't, I'll be legally bound to sign my life to service in a draft against my will under the Selective Service System, and may have it done so without my knowledge through my high school)* one nation under God *(whom I am forced to recognize here, even though we are not a Christian nation, and I may have been atheist and may still be if it weren't for indoctrination before the age of reason, or perhaps am not of a monotheistic faith and therefore would not subscribe to devoting myself under a single God)*, indivisible *(not counting the Civil War...)*, with liberty and justice for all *(so long as you're not a woman, minority, immigrant, or homosexual... basically you're fine if you're a 'Merican born rich white man)* \n\nNow, I'm not trying to be \"mean\" to children and say they cannot possibly be told about these things, and perhaps have some basic grasp of the troubles. I'm saying that they aren't taught, and can't be asked to understand the depth or breadth of the issues at hand. I'm not saying they are incapable of a basic concept of grief or strife. They could surely understand sorrow. But to grasp the complex legal and social ramifications of pledging themselves to a nation as large as America... is ridiculous. I don't think a child is capable of comprehending the NSA stealing our information, the implications of wars we've started on the lies of our leaders... I'm sure they don't know about the government being convicted of the murder of MLK, or how we've kept people in internment camps... I'm sure they're unaware of the murders, bombings, and lynchings that have gone unpunished because of our legal system. How right after this pledge, their fathers still can't be married because it's an abomination to a select group's ideals.... There's a level of indoctrination involved with altogether disturbing consequences.

To me it's ridiculous that anyone should be forced to say anything. \n\nI guess I didn't make my point clear.  Students, in my opinion, *should not* be forced to recite the pledge.  Speaking practically, they *are* forced to.  It's not like anyone will haul you off to jail for not saying the pledge (although at my school you wouldn't be the first to be sent to the office for it).  Yet peer-pressured and uninformed students usually will not exercise their rights.  It seems your school was different.  Congrats. Yet your experience is not universal.\n\n&gt; I don't suppose that would that fall under the first amendment...? Freedom of no speech? I know the 5th amendment only applies to legal processes.\n\nYes, it does.  Constitutionally speaking, it is no longer defensible to *force* a student to recite the pledge.  Yet practically speaking, freedom of speech is highly limited in school settings, beyond even what in loco parentis would imply.  \n\nSo, now that I've hopefully made my stance clear, I will address your first point.\n\n&gt; My point is that the pledge of allegiance doesn't at all contradict the principles of the constitution and Declaration of Independence (to which it alludes) that I think most agree are good. Like \"all men are created equal\" and \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\", etc. Just because we fall short of those, doesn't mean we shouldn't remind ourselves of where we should be. So I don't understand using that as a reason not to say the pledge.\n\nBTW, I don't know if the principles of the Declaration of Independence need to be held up like those of the Constitution.  The DoI isn't binding, and beyond the spirit, it doesn't apply anymore.  \n\nI don't see the pledge as supporting the United States constitution.  Instead, I see it as supporting a vision of America that was held by Americans in the 1800s and the 1900s.  \n\nFor instance, America isn't really \"under god.\"  That would be contradicting pretty much all of what the pilgrims stood for, as well as the secularism that has been put into the Constitution.  \n\nFWIW, the pledge says nothing about all men being equal.  That's in the DoI. Not sure what you're getting at there.\n\nI see your point about the ideas being goals rather than present realities.  Yet I don't think that point comes across in most classrooms.  I also think it's a minority viewpoint.  People see America as providing those values, even when that perception is inaccurate.\n\nIf the pledge was truly understood by schoolchildren in the way you seem to, that would be a different story.  But as it is, and while we're talking about historical allusions, the pledge seems to be a relic of red scare-era nationalism, of the time of the Bellamy salute and of fascism.

"}, {"id": "cm6rbqw", "body": "I agree with you on your point about teenagers - I am an early childhood specialist with two degrees in education and behavior therapy, I'm mostly coming at this from an early childhood angle. Mainly 5 - 7 years old, when Kindergarteners - 2nd graders are often taught the pledge. \n\nThe reason why we shouldn't treat \"loyalty to country\" in the same \"right vs wrong\" format as your other examples is because it's not a black and white situation. Determining where your national loyalties lie is FAR beyond the developmental capabilities of a child that young. To put it in perspective, first graders often struggle to remember the difference between a \"town\" a \"state,\" and a \"country.\" It's completely developmentally appropriate, the kids are always mixed up every year, and I usually work with them throughout the year to help them sort it out. But it's not unusual to ask a child that age what state they are from and have them say \"United States!\" Or what country they live in, \"Florida!\" \n\nI bring this up to highlight how incapable children this age are of determining what they are pledging their loyalty too. To them, it's a completely intangible idea. Also, until age 7 on average, children are egocentric. This means that they will put themselves first, no matter what. It's why kids tend to hit each other and steal and not want to share, again, it's developmentally appropriate. \"Loyalty\" and \"justice\" are abstract concepts that work in direct contrast to egocentrism, and it's a rare young child who can identify those emotions, let alone put them into practice.  \n\nNow, how I think the pledge affects this? Rote recitations have been used as brainwashing techniques for a long, long time. By having a child say those words, every day, they grow up assuming that they have always believed it. For as long as they can remember, it has been important that they pledge \"allegiance\", as in belonging and obedience, to a government. \n\nIt's similar to a child who is indoctrinated with an outrageous religious belief as a child, or a child who is raised surrounded by gang culture - it creates a pattern of truth in their brain, and becomes immensely more difficult to undo. \n\nAnd as far as it being unconstitutional for a teacher to force a student to say the pledge, in young classrooms that would be enforced....basically never. It's not like kids go home and tell mom and dad that their rights are being restricted. So for practical purposes, they truly cannot opt out. Without having the basic mechanisms necessary to understand *why* they should opt out, not having the ability to accidentally opt out...the only way is if their parents opt out for them.

I'm sure they're unaware of the murders, bombings, and lynchings that have gone unpunished because of our legal system.

How right after this pledge, their fathers still can't be married because it's an abomination to a select group's ideals.... There's a level of indoctrination involved with altogether disturbing consequences. Such as the Bellamy Salute, which you don't see us doing any more, we put our hands over our hearts now because we know that doing it like it used to be would imply similarity to totalitarian fascist regimes like Nazi Germany.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Millions? The most military casualties the United States has ever taken was during the civil war, where it's estimated that 650,000 American soldiers died. (212,000 of them in combat.)\n\nThe next biggest loss of life was, of course, World War II. Losses there numbered around 405,000; of which, 291,000 were in combat.\n\nThe next eight wars on the list (Including WWI, Vietnam, Korean War, Revolutionary War, War on Terror, War of 1812, Mexican-American War, and Northwest Indian War) number somewhere around 153k. Adding them all up, the number is just over a million. \n\nBesides that, even if the Axis powers had won WWII, it's pretty unlikely that Americans would be speaking German. When the war was declared, the German High Command recognized that they had absolutely no real way to attack or invade the United States directly, so they instead focused on naval warfare and disrupting shipping channels.\n\nAu\u00dferdem Deutsch nicht so schlecht ."}, {"id": "cm6uvfa", "body": "I hate americans.

In these recent conflicts we've been so justified when it is proven fact that the Bush administration lied about weapons of mass destruction in order to start the wars...\n\n[We spend more on our military than the next 8 highest military-spending nations in the world. It makes up about 20% of our federal budget, whereas spending on things like Science and Medical research and Education make up only 4% of the budget...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/07/everything-chuck-hagel-needs-to-know-about-the-defense-budget-in-charts/) We have issues. When people, or *hippies* as you so put them, talk about how we need to cut back and we aren't the greatest country any more and that there is a serious issue with the military industrial complex, they aren't joking. We like to consider ourselves the peace keepers of the world, and we go in and kick down other nations' governments to try and create their democracy for them... and when, historically, has that **ever worked**?? We haven't had another nation's troops march on American soil since the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, and we haven't have an official battle on American soil since the civil war (police brutality notwithstanding). The argument then becomes whether or not we just be an aggressive or defensive nation, and if history has proven anything (especially recent history), we have tended to be an aggressive nation in spite of the majority will. Why I should be forced to respect the actions of that government and it's conquests, and feel proud of our actions, I do not understand.\n\nAnd, all those *hippies* blaming society that you would prefer to shut-up and get out are exercising their right to free speech, which your glorified troops would be defending.

It may be of interest to you that the \"under God\" phrase in the Pledge is a fairly recent addition, as recent as the late 1940s.\n\nI realize the term \"under God\" was a Cold War era addition to our Pledge and Currency, but that has no bearing on either the current form, nor on the fundamental principle of making someone pledge to a god under the protections of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. There's been a lot of court cases involving this, which has somehow managed to remain dismissed as \"tradition\" rather than the promotion of a deity as it clearly is. It was added as a response to the Red Threat and Communist *\"militant atheism\"* and is a vestige of a fundamentalist past weakness in our country where we cast aside some of our ideals in order to try and be the ' holy good guys'. And, this country was *NOT* founded on Christian ideals. The colonists may have been largely puritan, but the founding father's themselves were educated men, and Enlightenment era thinkers. If you look at documents from the Founders, they were largely agnostics or atheists. And, once again, *Establishment Clause*.\n\n&gt;which has provided you with the highest standard of living on the face of the planet\n\n*Rah rah, woo hoo America!* Um, no. Not at all. We have some of the most expensive healthcare in the world, often ranked far below other modern countries like Canada, the UK, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden... In Education we are ranked somewhere between 17th and 26th in the modern world... we are top in gun related deaths... I could go on and on and on and on but it seems a little too easy to find how massively we're starting to lack behind the rest of the world. We just slipped into 21st place, behind France, on the personal freedoms index... we are *NOT* the highest standard of living in the world. \n\n&gt;The problem you're having with this draft thing is that you're selfish to the point that you can't think past your own well-being and are unwilling to fight for the principles that are enumerated in the Pledge, nor are you willing to defend your own liberty from the likes of ISIS or other groups that would love to destroy us. In fact, the only reason you're allowed to hold and publicly espouse your opinions is because of the freedom that has been granted to you by being in this country.\n\nI feel that expressing my opinions with my vote, protest, and activism does more good than joining the military to lay down my life for a corrupt government. I will more than willingly die for my family, or die in the name of this country, but not for this nation, not for the aristocracy that runs it. If you want to lay down your life in this nation's unjustified wars, which the rest of the world condemns us constantly for, be my guest. You can die for your nation, I'll live for my country. \n\n&gt;Many of the sections you attack in your spiel are not assessments of the country's state, but rather they are ideals that we are to strive for.\n\nThis might be the only vaguely proper point you make, but even still, it's drilled into children's heads as a statement, a pledge. It is said without critical thinking or discussion. \n\n&gt;No one in this country has perfect justice or freedom, no one in the entire world does, but, this country espouses those principles and is well along the road to achieving it.

Florida Statues mandate it, and the only get around is Frazier v Winn, but even that says a student needs a parents permission to not be forced to stand and pledge.

Interpretation and generalities are fine as part of a larger framework, but the mere interpretation of facts is a essentially just a semantic game. It rests on a bedrock of... what? Defining things a certain way? Devising new terminology? Categorizing and re-categorizing things? - all purely esoteric and designed to obfuscate the fact that what is behind this is *moralizing* - in other words, policing social interaction in order to realize an ideological agenda.\n\nEven looking at these two specific examples, and one wonders where the line is drawn - where does hybridity cease and appropriation begin? Is there a hard and fast line at all? These two examples seem clear, but I want to know if such a distinction could even be made at a 'hard line' - and if it were, wouldn't it merely be arbitrary, since these are all just made-up terms and definitions? And couldn't hybridity arise *out of* appropriation? Aren't all cultural exchanges creating 'new cultural forms'? How does a halloween costume 'replay narratives of domination'? Doesn't a narrative require that the 'narrator' voicing it have some comprehension or understanding of what they're doing? If a hapless teenager dons a headdress without any sense of the significance of it, is he or she really 'replaying a narrative'? If I put on a Lakota ceremonial headdress in my house and no Lakota know about it, does this harm them in some way? If so, *how does this work exactly*? And, in fact, you can't even answer either question because you don't know my race or nationality - which reveals another subtle, unsettling aspect to these arguments: they all inevitably hinge on judging the actions of others based on a metric which includes their race or ethnic group. But isn't this a sort of 'reverse' argument from authority, where the identity of someone doing or saying something affects how you judge them? It's certainly prejudice, at the very least.\n\n&gt; As I read it, generally there is a concern that appropriation enriches the appropriator at the expense of the appropriated and a concern that appropriation violates some aspect of the integrity or dignity of a culture (e.g. the right to define itself).\n\nBut how does a white person donning a headdress affect the culture who created the headdress' ability or right to define itself? How do the private actions of one individual 'harm' other cultures? We'll say for the purposes of this argument: specifically, *actions that affect no one else in any physical way*. How could they 'harm' anything? How does one 'harm' a culture in the first place? And how is it that a Native American wearing a t shirt and jeans doesn't 'harm' our culture? Ah yes, the arbitrary distinction between the dominating and subjugated culture arises.\n\nNow, for the sake of clarity, I'm not arguing that the American colonists didn't subjugate the Native Americans. I'm not pretending as if I don't know what what culture is or can't imagine how one might 'harm' a culture - but this is all in the sense I was speaking of earlier, as a vague generality, a limitation of language perhaps, that we would confound cultural harm under the same label that we use to describe physical harm. But that's the very problem with moralizing over 'harm' done that isn't physical and can't even be well-defined, or judging the actions of others based on mere interpretation, on costs and benefits that can't be grasped onto in any meaningful way. And furthermore it troubles me that we'd be willing to levy the charge of 'replaying a narrative of domination' against an ignorant person wearing a headdress purely because *they're white*. Judging people for what their ancestors did is a bit too 'Old Testament' for my taste; and frankly talking of abstracts like 'dignity' and 'culture' as if harm done to them is akin to real harm stinks of the Republican talk of the nation's 'moral fabric'... which offends my taste as well. I remember when the Supreme Court was debating on the issue of gay marriage; one justice (I can't remember who) asked (and I'm paraphrasing): If gay marriage will 'harm our nation's cultural values' or 'tear at its moral fabric'... what does that mean? How does that work exactly? With perspectives like this I often find myself asking the exact same questions. \n\nAnd by the way, does this concern subculture too?

While I think it's definitely time for someone to consider what they're going to do with their life, and how they're going to do it in lower economical situations it's very difficult to get off the ground as an 18 year old. Things like a vehicle and a first job can be absurdly hard to obtain and though the person is an \"adult\" for legal reasons, they honestly don't have the resources an adult should have at their disposal. The reason I suggest 20, is that if a child cannot be threatened with being removed from the household because their of a certain age and they don't have any obligations I think 2 years outside of high school is a very real fighting chance to gain real independence while ensuring parents aren't entirely stuck with their potentially deadbeat kid forever.\n\nA secondary part of my argument is that up until their 17 teens have very limited opportunities outside of high school to develop themselves and build meaningful connections that will benefit them right out of high school, and so the 18-20 range would give them the chance to develop themselves to the extent needed to survive. Weather that means working or going to school should be up to the person in question, but said person should have a roof over their head while they figure it out. \n\nEdit: Another issue to consider is that with financial aid disbursement, students have to use their parents taxes till age 23 a lot of the time which might mean they have to put college off significantly if they get caught in a poor situation with the bureaucratic red tape.\n\nAlso, please assume that under these circumstances I'm not considering the outlier issues that come from such a change (such as arguments for dads concerning abortion. Or how the legal system would handle financial responsibility.)  I know that issues like this exist, but they are tangential and so won't really change my view.   \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It's all about the compatibility of the couples and their ability to raise children well. \n\nPersonal preface - I did not have a very happy childhood. I was raised by a single mother, and she, while caring, raised me very, very wrong, and I've come to realize that fact only relatively recently. I was a social shut-in, had a hard time making friends or even socializing with others throughout the high-school all thanks to bullying. That wouldn't be so bad, if her \"advice\" didn't \"destroy\" any development I had then as a person. Even now, I'm not OK, I'm not really fully sane at all. I'm a miserable being full of irrational hate towards quite a few things... Well, I won't go on anymore. \n\nThere are many other children who have it even worse, even with both parents, because they are horrifyingly bad parents. They are brought into this world against their will by the dumb shits who should never ever have children. \n\nWhy continue this? It only causes misery for the children, trouble for the governments dealing with child abuse, etc. \n\nTogether with legal abortion, any illegal pregnancies should be aborted, and the parents fined/sentenced. And professional psychiatrists, government employed should evaluate couples if they are able to stay together and care for the child, and either give the permit, or not. \n\nThis system would not be without it's flaws, because it would require a rather intrusive and annoying control, requiring you to show a child-bearing permit to police officers or anyone else enforcing said law. It would also do little against the poor, rural people who already breed like rabbits. But a few jail sentences and crippling fines would eventually curb it, as long as the foster care is strictly controlled by the government so that orphans have a good childhood.\n\nIt would get awkward with same-sex couples, but I'm sure the permit would allow them adoption instead. This would also really simplify adoption for them, hopefully.\n\nAnother hurdle is the evaluation experts themselves - it would require time for them to gain experience in order to evaluate couples well. It would most likely have to end - up as a very very well paid job, requiring the best of the best in human psychology. Which is not that bad of a way to attract people to that discipline.\n\nAlso the economic aspect - how to decide if a rather poor couple can have children? This ties in to my previous point - the evaluating professionals need to take everything in account, and predict possible outcomes - a very difficult, if at all possible task. But as long as the system makes sure that the neglected, abused and miserable children are nearly non-existent, it has done it's job. As long as children grow up as more or less sane, healthy and functional human beings, the system has done it's job, even if there are far less of them.\n\nTo clarify once again, I do not mean eugenics - aka gene based breeding. It's all about only allowing the fit parents to have and raise children.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

One of the biggest problems Japan and Europe face is a declinign birth rates and an aging population, which means fewer working people will have to pay to support the elderly, and for a longer amount of time.  The only thing saving the US is immigration, which provides growth of working adults now, and immigrants tend to have more than 2 children.

There are a few points I would like to address in regard to this. \n\nI should start by addressing the democratic politician. This is not in reference to the Democrat Party of America, or any other particular party, but rather, politicians that appear in a supposedly democratic society. Any ruler must somehow be subordinate to the nature of the society he rules. In all societies outside of democracies, the ruler has some leeway, because the ruler must set the course that the citizens follow. Democratic politicians have no such leeway, theoretically, because they are not supposed to have any. The government is to be \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" This implies that in a democracy, there is no legitimate ruler other than those who are supposed to be ruled: \"the people.\" Democracy means sovereignty of the people. This is the sacred, founding principle that citizens are supposed to defer to, and it is so sacred that the very existence of some citizens ruling over other citizens should be a scandal, unless the the ruled citizens are to be understood as slaves obeying their masters.\n\nThat is the principle, however the disturbing fact is that \"the people\" is a nonexistant entity, abstract and devoid of any constant empirical content. Its definition is arbitrary and its interpretation is constantly changing. The reason for this is that when joining different parts together into a whole, those parts are to be subordinated to something that is beyond them all.  A heap of sand is not an entity, because each grain of sand is a self-contained entity of its own, superseded by no other since they are all the same. Since all individuals in a democratic society are supposed to be sovereign, their uniting rests upon an individual consent whose motive is entirely individual. The philosophy of democracy is that every person is a self contained, but not self-sufficient, island; A perfect, solitary whole. Democracies are by nature contractual regimes and have no substance other than a free association that each citizen enters because he deems it somehow useful to join. What can \"the people\" of a democratic society be besides a constantly changing and, therefore, indefinable entity whose cohesion is the product of the brute force of mere habit?\n\nThe same may be said about the supposed will of the people. It's completely obvious that it is highly improbable for an aggregate of self-serving individuals, whose primary right is to obey his own free will, can end up having anything that even remotely resembles a common will. Indeed, it is enough for the average democratic politician that the will of the people be equated to the will of the majority. This is a blatant confession that the will of the people is actually the will of the greater number being forced upon the smaller one. Taking into account the number of abstentions, a \"majority\" in Western countries consists of at most 30 percent of a constituency. \n\nThe standard representative of \"the people\" is not supposed to be anything but the icon of the people's sovereign will: a passive executive officer. But since nobody knows, including the politician himself, exactly who \"the people\" are or what may actually be their common will, the only embodiment of the people is the elected politician and his particular will. \"The people\" are merely whatever their representatives may be. \"The people\" become the subjects of those who are supposed to be the servants of \"the people,\" while the representatives, who are supposed to bow down to the voice of \"the people,\" become their masters. Having inherited the sovereignty of \"the people,\" theirs is a natural propensity towards arbitrary power, to feeling entitled not only to make whatever decisions they please, but to consider these decisions wise, since they are said to be \"the people's.\" Where only the popular will is a legitimate one, it naturally should have a say in whatever matter it pleases, hence the tendency of politicians to ceaselessly invade and legislate the private lives of ordinary citizens. There is a built-in totalitarian streak in the democratic politician's mentality. Since the centralization of power is only natural of democracies, because the people are the only decisionmakers, and no man can have two heads, it would be a true miracle if the collective body of politicians  were not to take advantage of such a proclivity, and another miracle if each of them didn't claim to embody the will of the people better than the others. Why shouldn't they all unashamedly enjoy wielding their illegitimate but lawful power? Since they are the people's de facto will, there is no higher authority. Whatever they do, they are irresponsible, blameless, generally beyond any court's reach; their persons are sacred and immune to persecution and their own constituency cannot help being hard put to indict those it is supposed to have selected to represent them.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In addition, so far in history they all have, at one point or another.\n\nWhat makes democracy stand out is that it self corrects from extremist positions. It does so at the expense of efficiency, but the overall effect is continual improvement, rather than leaping from huge improvements to massive disasters, which is what happens when you hand an efficient system to an extremist.\n\nIn terms of survival of the fittest, a system that constantly improves is better than one that is extremely effective, then extremely ineffective.\n\nHomeostasis is a good thing, though it annoys purists. If you think about it, purists are a form of extremist by definition, so democracy is doing it's job when is annoys them. "}, {"id": "2moubu", "body": "EDIT: and of course, on my longest and most thought-out post, I fuck up the title.\n\nAs an American, I've been thinking about the democratic system, and it is a massive facade, an impossibility and a paradox. There are a few points I would like to address in regard to this. \n\nI should start by addressing the democratic politician. This is not in reference to the Democrat Party of America, or any other particular party, but rather, politicians that appear in a supposedly democratic society. Any ruler must somehow be subordinate to the nature of the society he rules. In all societies outside of democracies, the ruler has some leeway, because the ruler must set the course that the citizens follow. Democratic politicians have no such leeway, theoretically, because they are not supposed to have any. The government is to be \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" This implies that in a democracy, there is no legitimate ruler other than those who are supposed to be ruled: \"the people.\" Democracy means sovereignty of the people. This is the sacred, founding principle that citizens are supposed to defer to, and it is so sacred that the very existence of some citizens ruling over other citizens should be a scandal, unless the the ruled citizens are to be understood as slaves obeying their masters.\n\nThat is the principle, however the disturbing fact is that \"the people\" is a nonexistant entity, abstract and devoid of any constant empirical content. Its definition is arbitrary and its interpretation is constantly changing. The reason for this is that when joining different parts together into a whole, those parts are to be subordinated to something that is beyond them all.  A heap of sand is not an entity, because each grain of sand is a self-contained entity of its own, superseded by no other since they are all the same. Since all individuals in a democratic society are supposed to be sovereign, their uniting rests upon an individual consent whose motive is entirely individual. The philosophy of democracy is that every person is a self contained, but not self-sufficient, island; A perfect, solitary whole. Democracies are by nature contractual regimes and have no substance other than a free association that each citizen enters because he deems it somehow useful to join. What can \"the people\" of a democratic society be besides a constantly changing and, therefore, indefinable entity whose cohesion is the product of the brute force of mere habit?\n\nThe same may be said about the supposed will of the people. It's completely obvious that it is highly improbable for an aggregate of self-serving individuals, whose primary right is to obey his own free will, can end up having anything that even remotely resembles a common will. Indeed, it is enough for the average democratic politician that the will of the people be equated to the will of the majority. This is a blatant confession that the will of the people is actually the will of the greater number being forced upon the smaller one. Taking into account the number of abstentions, a \"majority\" in Western countries consists of at most 30 percent of a constituency. \n\nThe standard representative of \"the people\" is not supposed to be anything but the icon of the people's sovereign will: a passive executive officer. But since nobody knows, including the politician himself, exactly who \"the people\" are or what may actually be their common will, the only embodiment of the people is the elected politician and his particular will. \"The people\" are merely whatever their representatives may be. \"The people\" become the subjects of those who are supposed to be the servants of \"the people,\" while the representatives, who are supposed to bow down to the voice of \"the people,\" become their masters. Having inherited the sovereignty of \"the people,\" theirs is a natural propensity towards arbitrary power, to feeling entitled not only to make whatever decisions they please, but to consider these decisions wise, since they are said to be \"the people's.\" Where only the popular will is a legitimate one, it naturally should have a say in whatever matter it pleases, hence the tendency of politicians to ceaselessly invade and legislate the private lives of ordinary citizens. There is a built-in totalitarian streak in the democratic politician's mentality. Since the centralization of power is only natural of democracies, because the people are the only decisionmakers, and no man can have two heads, it would be a true miracle if the collective body of politicians  were not to take advantage of such a proclivity, and another miracle if each of them didn't claim to embody the will of the people better than the others. Why shouldn't they all unashamedly enjoy wielding their illegitimate but lawful power? Since they are the people's de facto will, there is no higher authority. Whatever they do, they are irresponsible, blameless, generally beyond any court's reach; their persons are sacred and immune to persecution and their own constituency cannot help being hard put to indict those it is supposed to have selected to represent them.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Not really cool when you do the opposite when you get the job.
