Freedom of speech - at least as understood in American culture and law - is necessary for robust civil discourse.  It's very, very rare that we only ever have on point of view being espoused.  In fact, that's something far more characteristic of states run by governments that highly regulate speech.\n\nIn contrast, under our FoS scheme, we have tons of viewpoints in our 'marketplace' that are constantly being probed at, falsified and analyzed.  It's not just about you being able to say what you want, but other people to say what they want, and the interplay between the two.  Discussions require not just listening, but engaging a person and their ideas, anticipating their points, and thinking about your own.  It's a two-way street, not some one-way road where some hand is spoon-feeding you information you digest by default."}, {"id": "cm8pal8", "body": "&gt; under our FoS scheme, we have tons of viewpoints in our 'marketplace' that are constantly being probed at, falsified and analyzed.\n\nIs there evidence this was not the case when the Fairness Doctrine was in effect?"}, {"id": "2my5gl", "body": "Keep in mind, fairness doctrine did not affect the internet so it will not be doctored to spread it's influence onto the internet.\n\nArguments for: \nPublic interest: It would give people more exposure to counter arguments which I believe would solve a lot of problems. What is wrong with people being more education on both sides, they still have free will right?\n\nPower of the media: This should not be discounted. It exists, it's been documented. People want to watch what they agree with and will consciously decide not to watch the opposition for no other reason then emotional attachment to views.\n\nGiving one side of the story is claimed to be a right to free speech. Ok i buy that argument. It is said that via property rights, and free speech, I should be able to say what I want. OK, I agree with you but here's the issue, John Smith can say what he wants and doesn't have near the sphere of influence that X (famous newscaster has). People respect those with power and are more influenced to listen to them.

A counter party example would be people who vote democratic based on their morality of the issue of \"Pro-choice.\" The voter believes that pro-choice is the best, and may discount Republicans based on the \"morality of the party\" overlooking some of the more progressive Republicans who take a stance of neutrality to the issue.

Spend it on the military? But then how can we protect the weak overseas? \n\nNo emotion? Ok. We shouldn't. America is broken, we need infrastructure. I believe that we should always \"pay ourselves\" first, and help with what is remaining. We have problems at home, we should address those first because it only makes sense to keep the money as close as possible so that it can promote more growth. \n\nSpend it on health care? But then let the elderly suffer in pain? \n\nMy grandmother is 85 and just got a hip surgery that was reported to have cost 80k. I don't know if my mom is wrong on that figure but thats bullshit. The elderly currently are reaping much more benefits then they should. Yes, the elderly might suffer from fewer awesome benefits, but it would give access to millions who don't have it now. I just talked to my friend who is 22 and tore is ACL. He didn't have insurance 5 years ago when it happened and couldn't get it fixed. He will be in pain and never be 100% again. Wouldn't you say that its better for public interest to do ACL surgeries for free on kids who are 17, then give new hips to grandmother's who are 85? That is assuming that we couldn't have both options, which I believe we actually could!\n\nSpend it on education? \n\nCollege education. Putting young people in debt at the start of their careers, just so the middle and upper class can pay less in taxes is stupid. It is short sighted. We need to think long term and not short term. \n\nSpend it on corporation? \n\nNo corporate taxes should be 0% but all income made in America should be subject to tax. If the corporation is foreign, that income would be taxed. If the corporation is domestic, it should be 0% like I said. We need to tax income at the very last stage before it exists our economy. If we can tax it on personal income taxes for citizens, so be it.\n\nSpend it on social security? \n\nSocial security should transfer into basic income. Give a basic income to everyone who is a non millionaire. I heard a statistic (It may or may not be true) that if you take all government spending. 2 trillion out of the estimated 3.5 trillion goes to safety nets and social security. 2 trillion is enough to give almost 20k to every non millionaire household in the US. 20k won't raise people out of poverty but it would spread the benefits more evenly and help with our wealth inequality problem.\n\nSpend it on transportation? \n\nYes, it is well known that good transportation helps with social mobility. I live in Chicago. I save thousands on gas and car payments by taking the CTA. It helps everyone and is definitely a reasonable government policy if you value social mobility and eliminating poverty.\n\nYou are going to have to support something with emotion.

I argue that the internet is much more non-bias then television shows. While the internet can be bias, it is much easier to view more material quicker, and the format of reading tends to be a harder medium to influence people then the forms of visual communication so bad people have a harder time manipulating people on the internet than when they post videos.\n\nI also think that we are a lot more accepting and less likely to deny/attempt to restrict things that we do not agree with.\n\nAlso, a lot of us see it as a broken system and refuse to participate. The older generations still play the game. It is hard to \"change a system\" when the majority still participates in it. A counter example (and my opinion) would be that the young need to get more involved and start calling the older people out on their bullshit. \n\nFor example: When I talk to my older Uncle about voting, he always seems to vote Republican because he believes in freedom, free markets, and lower taxes. While voting based on the morality of a party is noble, I feel that it overlooks potential competitors (of different parties) who would share similar beliefs to you or at least beliefs that you could manage. A counter party example would be people who vote democratic based on their morality of the issue of \"Pro-choice.\" The voter believes that pro-choice is the best, and may discount Republicans based on the \"morality of the party\" overlooking some of the more progressive Republicans who take a stance of neutrality to the issue. Their opinion is totally different, but if given power the outcome of the situation would not change.\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Thank you for saying \"But let's go with the idea that you're talking about a preponderance of people.\" I can tell you got what I meant and are a classy debater.\n\n&gt;Um, you do know that the 15-30 year olds didn't invent the internet, right? And that most actual content is produced by those older than 30? \n\nYeah but I was going off of internet usage rates. Younger people use the internet more than older. Your content counter argument is very strong however.

If all of 18-30 year olds actually got up and voted, they could change the outcome of virtually any election. They could dominate any primary to get their candidate in, and then sway the general election.\n\nPlease understand that for the point of argument I gave my personal opinion LAST. It is well known that the majority of young people don't vote and that is why I said that perspective first. I totally agree with you and by reading the next paragraph (where I said and my opinion) you should have caught the vibe that I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH YOU. Young people change elections and the reason that we don't vote (because the system is broken) is foolish because we are expecting others to change for us. I thought I was clear.\n\n&gt;What the hell does it matter if they are old or young - call out the people who suck. It doesn't matter if it's an asshole politician who is 29 or 69 - if they aren't doing the right thing, call them out on the bullshit.\n\nI'm sorry I shouldn't have used old or young. It doesn't matter. The reason I said that was primarily fueled by my view that older people vote more on average than younger people, and voters in general vote more based on party than on people. That is where I got the \"call older people out on their bullshit\" but in general I agree we need to call everyone out on their bullshit, it just so happens that their are a lot of older people we need to call out. \n\n&gt;Sorry, I really didn't get the example of your uncle.

It's not out of blind adherence to one party but an understanding of my own views and how they are most likely to get represented.\n\nAwesome perspective and I'm glad you said it. May I ask what political party you align with? I'd like to take a guess: Democratic/liberal. And also, how do you research? Do you do it via the internet? That would kind of prove my point. In general, older people get their political information from the television. \n\n&gt;It's not out of blind adherence to one party but an understanding of my own views and how they are most likely to get represented.\n\nI read your paragraph and I see your point.

Not to mention, the former has the potential to expand by 1.9 million more viewers versus 1 million for the streaming. Its in the studios best interest to keep, in the minds of the consumer, the standard price of watching a movie high.

The most likely one is that Netflix and the rights holders couldn't come to terms. This happens in every industry every single day. It's called capitalism.\n\n&gt;So the question is, does the studio make more money from having me watch it on Netflix, or having me take 20 minutes to torrent it?\n\nYour juvenile self-entitlement to products you have no logical or ethical right to is irrelevant to the licensing negotiations between Netflix and it's suppliers. "}, {"id": "2mxp68", "body": "If you've been using streaming content like Netflix since it was first created, you probably noticed that the majority of the best content in terms of movies has been removed. This is a result of the production companies that own these materials refusing to license them or demanding cost-prohibitive fees. Regardless of the cause, the result is that, in general, these streaming services have become a wasteland of throw-away, low-rated movies. It's not clear if the studios are doing this because they want people to buy the movies directly or they are hoping to launch their own competing streaming services.\n\n[Two exceptions here. First, there is still some high-quality television options. Second, studios seem willing to release premium films for short amounts of time, especially if it helps generate interest for sequels.]\n\nThing is, I think this is a short-sighted tactic for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, for many consumers, one or two streaming services is all they will use. These services are replacing the home library - I don't think modern consumers are buying movies like they used to. This throws the two justifications for limiting the content into peril; these services aren't necessarily cannibalizing sales and competing streaming services aren't going to be feasible.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, as consumer behaviors change to favor streaming in home theaters (as opposed to going to movie theaters and building home libraries) stubbornly limiting your best content to only the old distribution channels has never kept consumers from adopting new behaviors. Instead, it only keeps them from seeing your best content.\n\nThird, this is how this becomes a problem. Eventually, your customer base loses patience altogether and finds other things to do. If \"movie night\" is a behavioral habit that supports the movie industry, playing games with the content that undermines that habit is a tremendous risk. It's only a matter of time before customers stop expecting good movies if the only movies they have access to on the services they use to watch movies are crap.\n\nTL:DR - If people use streaming media to consumer movies, and only bad movies are on streaming media, people will eventually watch fewer movies. That's bad for business.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

People talk about how much companies will get per-view on Netflix. To my understanding, that's not how it works. Netflix pays a flat fee for licensing rights for a certain period. People can watch that content 10 times a day or once and the companies will make the same amount of money. Another issue that I've seen with Netflix is that they don't release viewer metrics. These things are very important to content owners and they want to be able to track how their product is being consumed. \n\nThere will always be movies that people want to go out and see with their friends or significant others. It's a culture that isn't going anywhere any time soon. With some of these movies, people will say \"I'll wait for it to go on DVD/Blu-Ray.\" Companies print a certain number of discs and know where those discs are going. With streaming services, it's not that simple or quantifiable.

The fact that the man in the article is a public figure is the only reason his racism is coming under fire, because if any other old man/woman said the same shit, even the least racist people I know would shrug and say something about not even being worth the confrontation due to them being so old and set in their ways.

"}, {"id": "cma1hjr", "body": "&gt; honestly I'm finding the idea of him finding gay people disgusting and yet having no issue with his wife's gay friend pretty incongruous, especially when you said that he dislikes being around gay folks.\n\nIf you're not going to take my anecdote at face-value because of presuppositions you hold about social interaction, that's fine, but I'm not interested in arguing over it. People are perfectly capable of not only tolerating but being quite nice to other people they don't like, or who in some way bother them; this goes on all the time in modern society. In every society, probably.\n\n&gt; If he's going out of his way to deliberately avoid someone who's never done anything wrong to him, that can be pretty rude or even potentially hurtful given the right circumstances, especially if that person likely has been having to deal with that type of behavior in people their entire life.\n\nOhhhh-kaaayy, it seems like you're having a serious problem with the idea that people can believe differently from you, and even differently in ways that you think are awful and still treat people will respect. And frankly, I think it's rude to think you're entitled to the company of other people; some people are not going to want to be around you regardless of whether its for something controversial like this or because you're too talkative for their taste, or too quiet, or have bad breath, or don't share the same hobbies, or don't share your political views, etc. (And I don't mean you specifically, I mean the global you). This is just a fact of life. I don't hang out with rude people - and someone's beliefs, whether I like them or not, don't constitute how 'rude' they are.\n\n&gt; I think the moral thing to do in your situation would be to call him out on it when he brought it up. This doesn't need to be some kind of hostile thing. Just ask him, \"Hey, why is it that you feel that way?\"\n\nI know why he feels that way. There's something called the Kinsey scale that measures where someone's sexuality falls; it's not black and white, and most people fall somewhere in the middle. I would venture to guess that he's probably all the way on the 'straight' end and is repulsed by the thought of that type of sexuality. We can't control what we're disgusted by.\n\n&gt; The first step to getting an otherwise decent person to change a bad attitude is to get them to seriously think about why they have it in the first place. \n\nBut what's a 'bad attitude'? I disagree with most of my friends on just about everything, and most of them are well-educated and haven't come to their beliefs arbitrarily. Obviously, in any group there will be some people who hold some foolish or uninformed beliefs, but even then I'm only concerned with it if their actions cause harm to others. And I simply don't hold to the idea that someone else's beliefs are, in and of themselves, harmful. I don't mind having discussions about things like this either, but I generally don't engage with my friends unless they bring something up. I've spent enough time in my life trying to change people's opinions with reason to know that it has no real power; people are going to think what they *want* to think.

But there are reasons for disliking someone that are more legitimate then others. A person could be meanspirited, petty, thoughtless, etc, etc, and that would be a perfectly legitimate reason to dislike them, though in certain circumstances you might indeed have to interact with the person in a polite context. However, disliking someone for their sexuality is both arbitrary and heartless, as it is something that doesn't affect you personal, and doesn't harm anyone. \n\n&gt; I think it's rude to think you're entitled to the company of other people;\n\nI'm not saying anything about being entitled to another person's company, just that your friend's specific attitude against gay people is dehumanizing and cruel. \n\nTraits such as being overly talkative or having personal hygiene are actively irritating to be around, and lacking common hobbies would likely result in a lack of anything to talk about, so in those cases it's reasonable to want to avoid those people. Being homosexual has nothing to do with those things though. A gay person isn't more or less likely to be personally irritating, smelly, and their taste in hobbies and politics are generally just as varied as anyone else's. The only difference here is their taste in a romantic partner. \n\nYou seem to think I'm saying that people have a right to the company of anyone else regardless of circumstances, which isn't what I'm saying all. All I mean here is that having the attitude that another human being is inherently disgusting just because of their personal taste in romantic partners is itself fundamentally dehumanizing, arbitrary and cruel. \n\n&gt; There's something called the Kinsey scale that measures where someone's sexuality falls; it's not black and white, and most people fall somewhere in the middle. I would venture to guess that he's probably all the way on the 'straight' end and is repulsed by the thought of that type of sexuality.\n\nAll the Kinsey Scale discusses is what gender people are attracted to. It has nothing to do with feeling disgust for people opposite them on the spectrum. Straight people aren't inherently disgusted by gay people, and gay people aren't inherently disgusted by people of the opposite gender. \n\nThis really says nothing about why your friend is homophobic, but generally people pick up such attitudes either by being raised an in environment with other homophobic attitudes, or by picking it up somewhere as they grow up. \n\n&gt; We can't control what we're disgusted by.\n\nWe absolutely, 100% can. It's called exposure therapy, and it works with anything that makes people uncomfortable or fearful, not just people who dislike homosexuals. By seriously considering why something disgusts you in the first place and by gradually exposing yourself to that thing in small steps, you eventually can lose your disgust for it. \n\n&gt; people are going to think what they want to think. \n\nOf course, but they really ought to consider why they're thinking that in the first place.

Would you expect your father to keep the fact that he had a wife secret?\n\nMy father didn't find out I had broken up with an ex until 4ish years later when we were all hanging out and he got introduced to her new partner.  I'm honestly not sure if my mother knows at all.  It's not because I try to keep it a secret, it's because it's not relevant to the conversations.  The moment it becomes relevant I'll mention it but unless someone needs to know it's my wife I went skiing with I'm not going to mention it.  It's not hiding anything, it's just not advertising it.\n\nMy relationships are not the defining factor of my life.  People, activities, places, those are what define my life.

I'm not saying you should do what I did, as I agree with your reasoning for not doing or saying anything in your particular situation; but this advice may help somebody else facing a similar situation (sorry for my lack of brevity in advance). \n\n&gt;How? Her own daughter is gay and she wasn't able to change her mind. What am I supposed to do, show up for thanksgiving and tell her \"You know, before we have a nice dinner, let me try to change your view on someone's pet issue\"? \n\nI had a similar situation. My cousin is gay and his mom (my aunt) didn't accept or even acknowledge it at first. This anecdote isn't identical to your situation, but it's analogous.\n\nThe first Thanksgiving after he came out was at her (my aunt's) house. My cousin was originally not invited. Not invited to Thanksgiving with his own family. \n\nSo what did I do? I boycotted thanksgiving. Both my sister and I. We said we weren't going if my cousin wasn't invited, and that was that. We were going to have Thanksgiving at Cracker Barrel with him instead. We invited our parents (who were going to come) and anyone else in the family who wanted to come, but we weren't going to her house. \n\nEventually she came around, he was invited again and we all did Thanksgiving at my aunt's house. As a family. (It did require a lot of white wine for her to get through it, but she made it\u2026and that's a story for another day.)\n\nAnyway, what I eventually came to realize is my aunt was *embarrassed* that her son was gay. She was so worried about what the rest of the family would think she didn't want him there.
