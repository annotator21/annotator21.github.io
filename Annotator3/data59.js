In pro sports, facing facts, the goal is to make your team/sponsers money.  That's it.  It's not the purity of competition (as Olympics is supposed to be) or a means to give poor kids who are good at sports a shot at college (ideally what the NCAA is supposed to do).  That at least in my mind changes things.  Unless you're injuring the other competitors, it just doesn't hurt that many people to cheat.  The point isn't a fair and pure competition, the point is to sell tickets to the game.  As such, personally I find it hard to get mad about a player using Performance Enhancing Drugs or anything else allowed by the rules of the sport.  If Derek Jeter wants to chop off his dick and play in the WMLB, it's not the same thing as doing the same in collegate sports.  If Sammy Sosa was juicing (what am I saying, he probably was) so what -- in either of those cases, they did exactly what the point of the games in the first place was -- sell the seats at Wrigley Field.  \n\nCollege NCAA Div I should be different because the sport is about educational opportunity, and if a MAB trans gets a scholarship, that means that some other woman isn't going to college at all.  If that's the case, then allowing trans in Div I NCAA sports is hurting those women who otherwise could not get and education.  Body shape matters in almost any sport -- reaching 7ft as a man before becoming a woman (where women average perhaps 5'8'') that would give a large advantage and essentially mean that cis women aren't going to be getting Div I sports scholarships.  That does hurt the students who otherwise cannot afford to attend those schools.  For some, it's the difference between a degree from a college or a trade school.

She has been fighting for a few years now, and has had some brutal knockouts.  UFC commentator Joe Rogan has come under fire from news outlets for voicing a similar opinion to the one expressed in this post.\n\nShe was born as Boyd Burton, a man, and served in the military in her early twenties as a male, before working as a trucker to pay for her gender reassignment.  After her operation, she has started fighting professionally over the last couple of years.  She has stated that she picked up MMA in her gym in her late twenties, and now she is brutalizing the women of the UFC.  \n\nI want to be clear in that I whole-heatedly support her right to live her life in any style she sees fit as long as she's not hurting anyone.  However, despite removing her penis and testicles, receiving breast implants, and undergoing hormone treatments, I am of the opinion that she still has a male frame and should not be allowed to compete with female fighters professionally.\n\nThere is a reason we segregate the sexes in professional sports, especially MMA.  Men and women simply compete on a different level.  I'm not saying that there are not women who are talented, disciplined, and gifted athletes, as there are a myriad of examples of badass women in professional sports.  But, in the case of MMA, the male frame can simply hit harder and exert more strength.  This gives fighters like Fallon Fox a distinct and unfair (dangerous, even) advantage over fighters born with a female frame.\n\nI will respect Fallon Fox and other transgender persons as much as I would any other person, I will refer to her as a female, I have no problem with any sexual partners she decides to take.  But in this case and others like it, transgender fighters are not only fighting from an unfair advantage, but pose a substantial danger to natural born women fighting in the UFC.  Not only that, but it trivializes the lifetime of work that every other fighter has put forth to fight at a professional level.  The fact that Fallon Fox started fighting in her late twenties and is now beating down women who have dedicated their entire lives to the sport is ridiculous.\n\nSo Reddit, do you agree?  Should Fallon Fox be considered a legitimate female fighter?  Are her victories hollow?  Let me know what you think!  Change my view!\n\n(Disclaimer: If you decide to post on this thread, PLEASE be respectful to all types of people [including OP haha].

Basically, you need to picture overlapping bell curves.\n\n\nSuppose we consider bench press as some sort of metric for strength (it probably isn't the best metric, but bear with me). When I was really into strength training, my max press was around 200 lbs more than that of my weakest friend. He had no disabilities or anything; he was able-bodied, just not very strong. So anyway, I was nowhere close to being the strongest man alive, nor was he anywhere close to being the weakest.\n\n\nNow consider the average man and the average woman. Do you *really* think that there is going to be a 200 lb differential between their max press? Of course not. That's what I mean when I say 'the differences within genders are greater than the differences between'. I wasn't uncommonly strong, nor was my friend uncommonly weak. We just happened to have some pretty big difference with respect to muscle mass.\n\n\n\nEdit: Also yes, men are pound for pound rather stronger than women. Nobody is debating that claim. When I was at my lightest, around 145, I didn't encounter comparable strength in women unless they were athletic and around 20-30 lbs heavier than I was. That difference, though, is due to hormonal disparities. When a trans woman undergoes HRT for a prolonged period of time, her muscle and bone densities shift and she no longer possesses strength advantages conferred by testosterone.

UFC commentator Joe Rogan has come under fire from news outlets for voicing a similar opinion to the one expressed in this post.\n\nShe was born as Boyd Burton, a man, and served in the military in her early twenties as a male, before working as a trucker to pay for her gender reassignment.  After her operation, she has started fighting professionally over the last couple of years.  She has stated that she picked up MMA in her gym in her late twenties, and now she is brutalizing the women of the UFC.  \n\nI want to be clear in that I whole-heatedly support her right to live her life in any style she sees fit as long as she's not hurting anyone.  However, despite removing her penis and testicles, receiving breast implants, and undergoing hormone treatments, I am of the opinion that she still has a male frame and should not be allowed to compete with female fighters professionally.\n\nThere is a reason we segregate the sexes in professional sports, especially MMA.

UFC commentator Joe Rogan has come under fire from news outlets for voicing a similar opinion to the one expressed in this post.\n\nShe was born as Boyd Burton, a man, and served in the military in her early twenties as a male, before working as a trucker to pay for her gender reassignment.  After her operation, she has started fighting professionally over the last couple of years.  She has stated that she picked up MMA in her gym in her late twenties, and now she is brutalizing the women of the UFC.  \n\nI want to be clear in that I whole-heatedly support her right to live her life in any style she sees fit as long as she's not hurting anyone.  However, despite removing her penis and testicles, receiving breast implants, and undergoing hormone treatments, I am of the opinion that she still has a male frame and should not be allowed to compete with female fighters professionally.\n\nThere is a reason we segregate the sexes in professional sports, especially MMA.  Men and women simply compete on a different level.

We've seen what happens when the best women's MMA fighter (Ronda Rousey) spars with a top level, but not absolute best men's MMA fighter in a similar weight class (Gilbert Melendez). It's no contest. We also saw what happened when one fo the best lightweight men (BJ Penn) fought one of the best heavyweights (Lyoto Machida) - he won one round, but still lost the match by decision. Penn-Machida is comparable to Rousey-Melendez. Low chance of winning at the top level, and whether it's allowed to happen depends on the jurisdiction. Penn-Machida happened in Japan, and wouldn't have been permitted in any US state with an AC.\n\nUltimately, though, the decision comes down to her opponents.

After as much time as has passed in her case, if tested, she would probably end up in the same muscle mass category as her biologically born female counterpart.\nIn the same interview, Dr. Sherman Leis concurred in all respects.\n\n&gt;Indeed, given that women get 25 percent of their circulating testosterone from their ovaries, post-operative transgender women typically have less testosterone than their counterparts. Fox noted, \"Any of the women I'm competing against, my testosterone levels are drastically lower than theirs; it's almost nothing.\"\n\n&gt;Dr. Bowers agreed: \"When you test her, she's going to come out with low testosterone levels and muscle mass that is remarkably similar to her counterparts.\" These observations were borne out in Fallon Fox's first defeat at the hands of Ashlee Evans-Smith, where Fox's muscle fatigue in later rounds gave Smith an advantage.

I stand 5'8\" and have a body fat percentage and muscle structure that's the same as other women due to my status as being biochemically female. \n\nJazz, Fallon, and I all have one thing in common: We do not produce testosterone anymore. We have all either suppressed our androgens, or have ridded ourselves of the organs that produce them. At what age is the cutoff point for allowing Jazz to become a MMA fighter? Surely, she has not developed a \"male structure\" at all, and never will. \n\nIf I were to start training right now, would I have have an unfair advantage within a few years? I developed only half of the \"male structure.\" \n\nI don't get your point. Should all trans women be excluded from MMA, regardless of age of transition? Because according to your completely falsified stance on bone structure, Jazz in this example would be on par with the rest of the fighters, if she underwent training. What's the cutoff point? "}, {"id": "2lw4uf", "body": "Ok, so there has been a recent controversy over a UFC fighter named Fallon Fox.  She has been fighting for a few years now, and has had some brutal knockouts.  UFC commentator Joe Rogan has come under fire from news outlets for voicing a similar opinion to the one expressed in this post.\n\nShe was born as Boyd Burton, a man, and served in the military in her early twenties as a male, before working as a trucker to pay for her gender reassignment.  After her operation, she has started fighting professionally over the last couple of years.  She has stated that she picked up MMA in her gym in her late twenties, and now she is brutalizing the women of the UFC.  \n\nI want to be clear in that I whole-heatedly support her right to live her life in any style she sees fit as long as she's not hurting anyone.  However, despite removing her penis and testicles, receiving breast implants, and undergoing hormone treatments, I am of the opinion that she still has a male frame and should not be allowed to compete with female fighters professionally.\n\nThere is a reason we segregate the sexes in professional sports, especially MMA.  Men and women simply compete on a different level.  I'm not saying that there are not women who are talented, disciplined, and gifted athletes, as there are a myriad of examples of badass women in professional sports.  But, in the case of MMA, the male frame can simply hit harder and exert more strength.  This gives fighters like Fallon Fox a distinct and unfair (dangerous, even) advantage over fighters born with a female frame.\n\nI will respect Fallon Fox and other transgender persons as much as I would any other person, I will refer to her as a female, I have no problem with any sexual partners she decides to take.  But in this case and others like it, transgender fighters are not only fighting from an unfair advantage, but pose a substantial danger to natural born women fighting in the UFC.  Not only that, but it trivializes the lifetime of work that every other fighter has put forth to fight at a professional level.  The fact that Fallon Fox started fighting in her late twenties and is now beating down women who have dedicated their entire lives to the sport is ridiculous.\n\nSo Reddit, do you agree?  Should Fallon Fox be considered a legitimate female fighter?  Are her victories hollow?  Let me know what you think!  Change my view!\n\n(Disclaimer: If you decide to post on this thread, PLEASE be respectful to all types of people [including OP haha].

These benefits definitely outweigh the costs of implementing this program, as it greatly benefits children coming from high risk households and allows those families to be more productive overall.

It's not about getting our kids (all kids) ahead.  It's about trying to catch up ones that very likely come from environments where they're not taught certain skills.    The trouble is that any advancement of these kids falls away in a few years.  And by junior high those kids are as far behind their peers as they were back before kindergarten and first grade.   In other words,  it was a short term fix.\n\nIf you want to improve the outcomes for those kids --the higher risk kids -- you need to implement programs that will allow for positive changes in the home.   For example, identify why some parents let the television babysit babysit the small children instead of interacting directly with them.  Or. example educate parents on how important their kids schoolwork and attendance is. The changes at home should be something the parents can do and can stick with long term.   \n\nTo improve the outcome for all kids, I think we need to fix the entire public school system all the way through high school.   Colleges report too many freshmen arriving who are unprepared for the demands of college.   We have kids graduating high school barely able to read or struggling to add very simple fractions.   How are these kids being passed year after year when the tests show they're 3 or 5 years behind the reading and math levels?\n\n"}, {"id": "2lvw4x", "body": "Hi all!

I am also an avid Notre Dame fan, and Seahawks fan. \n\nI believe people watch sports for three reasons. \n\nFirst, they want to watch the best play at their peak. They want to see talent manifest itself. They want to see spectacular feats of strength, speed, intelligence, and dexterity. They want to see what humans are capable of when pushed to the limit. \n\nSecond, they want a connection with the human behind the athlete. For example, if I really wanted to, I could probably go to Denver and try to meet Payton Manning somewhere. Yeah it would be creepy, but I know he is a real person living somewhere, with a family, and a mortgage, just like me. I can go up to him and ask him how his kids are, what's the best place to get a steak, and so on. \n\nThird, they want something to root for. They want to feel invested in something bigger than themselves. They want to feel like they won the game, even though it was their team that won. \n\nLeague of Legends I believe is doing a mediocre job at the second area, and a pretty good job at the third. Games like smash do a great job at the first, but ignore the other two areas. \n\nUnless you play the game, there is little reason why anyone else would watch, especially if you take out everything it means to be a fan. \n\nFor example, I am a fan of Jason Zimmerman. I enjoy watching him play. He is unstoppable when he is on top of his game. His ability to think and adapt as well as his deep understanding of the game mechanics makes him a very enjoyable player for me to watch. But he also has his flaws. He has said in interviews he has depression problems. He didn't used to be very outgoing or personable for the longest time. He, however, want to prove people wrong, that he can be the best. \n\nHow many of you know who I am describing? \n\nWhat if I replaced Jason Zimmerman with Mew2King? \n\nThis is the problem. How is espn going to take an interview with \"Mew2King\" seriously? How are they going to go to a tournament and say Grand Finals is between ChillenDude88 and Chu Dat. Who are these people? \n\nLook at the smash documentary. It's so good, because it focuses on the players, instead of the game, but even it didn't use the players real name. \n\nThe problem is not the username. The problem is the announcers, the brackets, the everything using their username in place of their real name. Their username gets the glory, their real name is lost to oblivion. \n\nLook at Cloud9.  Off the top of your head, what are their names? How would you introduce them to someone who has never watched league at a bar? \n\nOh that jungle his name is Meteos. Think about how cringe worthy that sounds if you didn't have any interest in the game. \n\nTLDR: eSports needs to move away from usernames, and start using real names to embrace the human element of sports that casual fans love.

This is the mindset that a lot of people approach esports with.\n\nMy point is that if someone is weirded out by a couple of strange usernames, then they probably were going to find various aspects esports weird anyways."}, {"id": "clyqra3", "body": "Because \"Bunny Fu Fuu, imaqtpie, IWillDominate, hotshotGG, Lemon Nation, MarineKingPrime, Fruit Dealer,  Mew2King, and ChillenDude88\" are all incredibly shitty usernames that no one is going to take seriously. \n\nAnd the list goes on and on.
