Though not dramatically, we're talking a few hundred additional fatal shootings per year. Also more injuries, again not dramatic.\n\n&gt;Guns don't affect any crime rates except gun crimes. And the fact that they don't affect petty street crime is more evidence that DGU isn't common.\n\n[I'm sorry, but you're just wrong](http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/concealed-carry/)"}, {"id": "cm5clki", "body": "&gt; You're speaking from the standpoint of a city\n\nNo I'm not.

CCW permits have basically no effect of crime rates (certain gun crimes go up a tiny bit). \n\nYou're trying to confuse the first section with the first.

Someone or something is trying to kill you, and you've concluded it's about to succeed unless you shoot it.\n\nAnything that comes between you and a working gun in this situation might get you killed. People therefore tend to prefer old, proven designs when selecting guns for self defense. The basic operating mechanism for the vast majority of semi-automatic pistols, the type used by police and most civilians who own handguns for self defense, was designed by John Browning prior to 1900. The Glock, used by a majority of US police departments was finalized in 1982 and has seen only minor refinements since. It took a couple decades for a majority of gun owners to decide that pistols with so much plastic in them could actually be trusted. A great many of the other handguns that are popular today are arguably clones of the Glock.\n\nIn theory, I'd like my gun to refuse to shoot if someone stole it or managed to get it away from me while attacking me. In practice, I'm concerned that one of the following will happen:\n\n* The tech will require some sort of manual activation, and I'll get it wrong under stress\n* The tech will not activate as quickly as I can draw and fire the gun; if someone or something is trying to kill me, any such delay might lead to my death\n* The tech will not activate reliably\n* The battery will be dead\n\nI'm also 100% certain that if a gun with this tech is stolen, street criminals will figure out how to disable it. Guns aren't very complicated, and the firing mechanism is made out of springs and levers. Replacing whichever component that's made \"smart\" with one that isn't won't be hard. This would only prevent immediate unauthorized use, and I already have good ways to prevent that."}, {"id": "cm1fns0", "body": "I know it is impossible to ever fully ban guns, but I wonder why so many are against gun control measures?

What's the percentage or the statistics on actually becoming a victim of something like this, especially if you stay out of dark alleys, hang out with decent people, don't put yourself in dangerous situations etc etc. I feel like, specifically home invasions, are done by people who know the victims and are out to get revenge or something similar. So, based on statistics of becoming the victim of a crime, why do you *need* a gun?

But the Supreme Court (and others) have ruled on multiple occasions that the police do not actually have such a duty. Certainly most police will do their best to help you, in general, but there have been cases where the police have acted neglectfully, in my opinion, but not *illegally.* These cases generally fall under the \"public duty doctrine.\" Googling this phrase and reading cases about it is a chilling experience.\n\nIn one case, two women called the police when they heard their neighbors being assaulted by two men next door.

If you are being stalked or have an RO out against someone are two very good reasons, and I say this because of what I wrote in an earlier post. Statistically, ROs provide a false sense of security and the Supreme Court has ruled that the police do not have a Constitutional duty to protect individuals in danger, absent a special relationship with that individual. The police record on responding to ROs, even those with mandatory arrest clauses, is very dismal. Plus, the very act of obtaining an RO can escalate partner violence. RO-related arrests have also been shown to be escalating factors.\n\n&gt; Nobody is talking about blue-helmeted UN troops kicking down doors.\n\nNeither was I?\n\n&gt;And the stats tend to support that opinion.\n\nThe stats for average, everyday people, sure. But not people in special circumstances, like victims of stalking or partner violence."}, {"id": "cm5dtsh", "body": "&gt; Neither was I?\n\nLot of other posters are arguing \"all gun control = concentration camps\". That's the standard rhetoric from right-wing groups. \n\n&gt; The stats for average, everyday people, sure. But not people in special circumstances, like victims of stalking or partner violence.\n\nIt's a trade-off, like all public policy. Let's assume you're right and some people being stalked get killed because they don't have access to a gun. The trade-off is that a **lot** less people are killed in general because guns are generally less accessible. Less access means the stalker is less likely to have a gun as well. \n\nAnd remember, you're talking about a gunfight as **desirable**. If guns are widely available, the stalker (who is intent on violence) is far more likely to be armed so the 2 parties are going to shoot it out. \n\n"}, {"id": "2m6lxk", "body": "I've shot a gun before (am friends with a local cop who took me to the NRA's firing range).

I am a 19 year old Englishman at university (yeah, we have so much stricter gun control here than Americans).\n\nThe issue here is that you are saying 'Why do you need a gun?'. If you use that as the basis for owning something then a hell of a lot of what you have, you would not have. Why do you *need* your tv? \n\nThe question should not be 'Why should you have something' but 'Why should you *not* have it'. It's the difference between an object being *potentially* dangerous and *actually* dangerous. A gun is a potentially dangerous and deadly object, however, it only becomes *actually* dangerous when it is in the hands of someone who does not know how to use it safely or will actively use it unsafely, i.e. specifically to harm others. \n\nThis is why the issue of background checks and personal circumstances is one of the best ways to control guns - the issue is not supply of gun but access. People that are and will be perfectly safe to use them should not have their right to have one abridged because they are not a threat to anyone with it. Those that are mentally unstable or have a history of that or criminal activity, should not be considered safe to use them. You can trust the former group to handle and use them safely, you can't with the latter group. \n\nBanning guns on the basis that some people use them unsafely and harm people with them should be no reason to prevent the perfectly safe people from using them. Restricting the *access* of the unsafe group to them is where the best control lies.\n\nOn your point about 'needing' a gun, I don't 'need' it. I don't have my gun for self-defence or hunting or home security. One or two of those are illegal here anyway. I have mine for historical re-enactment. It's fun. I enjoy using it. I enjoy the sound, the flash, the recoil. I've been trained how to use it safely, I'm licenced and approved by the police so why the hell should I *not* have it?

They're worthless. \n\nLet's be clear: The issue here is not that DGU doesn't exist, but that it is very rare. Far more rare than gun murder, 200 per year vs 30,000. DGU advocates claim that most DGU is just threatening people with guns and claim numbers in the 1,000,000+ per year range. This means that for everyone killed by DGU, hundreds of people are threatened. And absolutely nore of those threats are ever recorded or reported to the police or the press by anyone. That's ridiculous. \n\nThe obligation is on DGU proponents to provide evidence for their claims, like that gun owners are covering up 100,000+ gun murders per year and secretly burning the bodies.  The only evidence I've ever seen presented for DGU is anecdote. \n\nYou should have a mountain of physical evidence.

A study by the Violence Policy Center, an anti-gun group found an average of 67,740 defensive gun uses per year.

They only include incidents reported to the FBI by local police. Someone attacked by a random stranger they can't identify who has long-since fled the area might not bother making a report to the police. The high estimates are probably wrong.

They're usually caught on security cameras rather than cell phones. They tend to be over so quickly it's hard for people to get a phone out in time, and being more dangerous situations than the average street fight, people might be less likely to try to film them.

This is the low end of estimates, and is still more than double the sum of suicide, homicide and accidental gun deaths during any year in the study (2007-2011), where the high was 32,163 deaths.\n\n&gt; You seem to forget there is an enormously powerful lobby that would make billions if they could prove DGU was common and they have millions to conduct that study. They haven't tried or even attempted to try because they know they're wrong. \n\nThere have been such studies; the National Self-Defense Survey conducted in 1994 estimated 2.5 million annual uses and the National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms, also in 1994 estimated 4.7 million.\n\nThe low estimates are probably wrong. They only include incidents reported to the FBI by local police. Someone attacked by a random stranger they can't identify who has long-since fled the area might not bother making a report to the police. The high estimates are probably wrong. They include self-reporting by those surveyed, which isn't necessarily reliable. None of the studies *anybody* takes seriously were conducted by asking for volunteers online. Those that involve self-reporting were done by the same polling firms that do voter surveys and market research.\n\n&gt; We see endless incidents of crimes by police or other people recorded, why not video of these gun threats? \n\nWe do see the occasional video of defensive gun use, but these incidents tend to be different from fights and abuse by police, which are situations that evolve over time. They're usually caught on security cameras rather than cell phones. They tend to be over so quickly it's hard for people to get a phone out in time, and being more dangerous situations than the average street fight, people might be less likely to try to film them. [Here's a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBtInW0Qz_I) (NSFW: it's a video of a robber getting shot).\n\nThere's also the fact that people committing violent felonies tend to prefer not to call attention to those acts. Criminals are less likely to initiate a mugging or home invasion when there's someone waving a smartphone around.\n\n&gt; \"Defensive gun use\" is a crime. It's \"brandishing a weapon\" or threatening someone with a weapon which is a crime.\n\nShooting people is a crime too, except that none of these things are crimes when they qualify as justifiable use of force.\n\nIt's also hard to measure the deterrence effect on crime, but there have been attempts. The Wright-Rossi survey funded by the DOJ interviewed incarcerated felons. It found 74% believed burglars avoided occupied houses for fear of being shot and 37% of felons surveyed had been \"scared off, shot at, wounded or captured by an armed citizen\".

Its expenses were $254 million.\n\nThat represents a tiny fraction of the US arms industry's total revenue. The NRA is just one small and unimportant group. Organizations like the Chamber of Commerce are much more important. \n\nIt strains credulity that an industry with so many resources wouldn't bother to put any effort into proving DGU was common unless they were quite sure it wasn't common.\n\nImagine the enormous propaganda value if the arms industry can prove that handguns were extremely effective at protecting people against crimes, which is what proving DGU is common would do. \n\n&gt; Did you just take the highest number given\n\nI did no math at all, that number was a bit hyperbolic. My point is that police reports of DGU are very rare. And the only evidence for most incidents of DGU is anecdote. \n\nLike I keep saying, where's the YouTube video? If these incidents were so common you would expect to see thousands (or at least dozens) or videos on YouTube. Or something. \n\nNow I'm not going to say there is no video of this ever happening anywhere, but I've never seen one and those videos would appear to be extremely rare. \n\n&gt; I'm saying that in an unknown number of cases\n\nIt's not unknown. It's simply not plausible that the same people who routinely report petty nuisances to police and clog up 911 lines do not call the police when the feel seriously threatened. \n\nYou're simply constructing a scenario and declaring it's common based on nothing. \n\nAnd again, apparently none of these people have home surveillance or security systems even though they are paranoid enough to have guns for home defense. \n\n&gt; but the legal bar for being justified in displaying a gun in self defense is lower than a criminal actually shooting at the victim.\n\nIt's only a little lower actually. That person has to plausibly pose a deadly threat in order for DGU to be legal, and that's the main reason it's not reported (and quite rare). Threatening people with guns is illegal, self defense and castle doctrine are defenses for that crime in the same way they are defenses for shooting someone. \n\n&gt; A lot of people pull out their phones to start filming when they witness minor crimes like street fights.\n\nSo it follows that people would pull out their phones when they witness MAJOR crimes as well.\n\n&gt; It's less common to find smartphone videos of armed robbery, burglary or murder,\n\nBut you do find them. In fact, there are cellphone videos of people being shot at in mass shootings so don't tell me everyone is too \"distracted\" to record anything. \n\nAnd you seem to be making this weird assumption that the person using the gun is always alone. Why couldn't another person who didn't have a gun record something? Even if they were hiding under the bed they could record a video saying, \"I think someone has broken into the house and my husband has taken the shotgun and is confronting him.\" You know, the kind of things they might say in a 911 call? \n\nI simply do not believe that an nation of people obsessed with recording everything and putting it on YouTube would never (or only very rarely) record incidents like these. \n"}, {"id": "cm1lynp", "body": "&gt; The trouble with this debate is that while we have good statistics on the frequency of crime, we do not have good statistics on defensive gun use[1]\n\nYes we do. The crime statistics are definitive. Defensive gun use is extremely rare in the USA. Privately owned handguns are almost never used for self-defense, it's a tiny fraction of the annual suicides. \n\nYou seem to forget there is an enormously powerful lobby that would make **billions** if they could prove DGU was common and they have **millions** to conduct that study. They haven't tried or even attempted to try because they know they're wrong. \n\nIf there really were millions of DGU incidents per year as gun advocates claim they should have endless hours of video tape of these incidents. Most Americans now carry a high-quality video camera on them at all times (smartphone), why aren't they recording any of this? We see endless incidents of crimes by police or other people recorded, why not video of these gun threats? \n\nAnd that last bit is the reason why: \"Defensive gun use\" is a crime. It's \"brandishing a weapon\" or threatening someone with a weapon which is a crime. Making a recording of that threat is admitting to a crime so people are reluctant to record it. \n\nBut we should STILL have video anyway. We've got video of people smoking crack, fighting, shooting at people, and doing tons of other illegal nonsense and posting it on Facebook and YouTube. \n\nThis reminds me a lot of UFOs. UFOs are largely camera artifacts of low-quality camera from the 1950s and 1960s. As cameras improved, we saw fewer UFO photos. And now with smartphones, we see basically none. \n\nI really need to stress the video part. If DGU was common we would have lots of video. We do not. \n\n&gt; If the mid-range or higher figures are accurate, guns prevent crime more often than they're used to commit crime.\n\nThose numbers are absolutely false. They're based on anonymous surveys of gun advocates in web forums. That's like saying Reddit upvoting is scientific proof. \n\n\"Defensive gun use\" is bullshit. Handguns in the USA are not used for self-defense, they are used from target shooting.\n\nIf you want to defend handguns in the USA, you have to defend them as a target shooting hobby.

Let's look at the 3 most deadly mass shootings in recent US history.\n\n#1: Virginia tech: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_shooting\n\nThis man was declared mentally ill, was in special education in grade school, and was accused of stalking a couple girls a couple years before the shooting. The laws were changed very quickly after this to prevent similar people from getting guns. I 100% agree that this is a flaw in the laws, even so today. It is definitely a kink that needs to be worked out.\n\n#2: Sandy hook: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\"A former teacher of Adam Lanza noted that he exhibited anti-social behavior, rarely interacted with other students and was obsessed with writing \"about battles, destruction and war.\"\n\nThis one is largely a mystery. I'll admit that. Except for the one quote I pulled. I'm willing to bet he had both schizoid and antisocial personality disorders. Problem with schizoid disorder is that people with this disorder don't interact with others enough to raise the red flags we would need. \n\n#3: Luby's Shooting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby's_shooting\n\nThis one is interesting. There were a few warning signs. He had a couple drug arrests, and stalked some girls. He also served in the military for a little while, which is an incredibly good way to bring out mental health problems in people. A recent movement has placed most new veterans in therapy to help with this. This probably would have caught this guys issues before the shooting could happen. \n\n\nI'm willing to admit that the laws are messy.

Let's look at the 3 most deadly mass shootings in recent US history.\n\n#1: Virginia tech: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_shooting\n\nThis man was declared mentally ill, was in special education in grade school, and was accused of stalking a couple girls a couple years before the shooting. The laws were changed very quickly after this to prevent similar people from getting guns. I 100% agree that this is a flaw in the laws, even so today. It is definitely a kink that needs to be worked out.\n\n#2: Sandy hook: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\"A former teacher of Adam Lanza noted that he exhibited anti-social behavior, rarely interacted with other students and was obsessed with writing \"about battles, destruction and war.\"\n\nThis one is largely a mystery. I'll admit that. Except for the one quote I pulled. I'm willing to bet he had both schizoid and antisocial personality disorders. Problem with schizoid disorder is that people with this disorder don't interact with others enough to raise the red flags we would need. \n\n#3: Luby's Shooting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby's_shooting\n\nThis one is interesting. There were a few warning signs. He had a couple drug arrests, and stalked some girls. He also served in the military for a little while, which is an incredibly good way to bring out mental health problems in people. A recent movement has placed most new veterans in therapy to help with this. This probably would have caught this guys issues before the shooting could happen. \n\n\nI'm willing to admit that the laws are messy.

First off, let me address your redneck / NRA gun nut problem.\n\nKnowing that I'm just some dude on the internet, I'm going to ask you to  believe that my self-description here is accurate.\n\nI'm at 25-year-old white guy living in NC. I was raised Republican, but recently voted a mostly-Democratic ticket. I don't like the rhetoric the NRA puts out, but they try to do good work in defending people's rights. Sometimes they succeed. I don't carry my gun to work (not allowed), but when I go out shopping or something, I strap my [Ruger LC9](http://www.ruger.com/products/lc9/models.html) into an inside-the-belt holster, drape my shirt over it and go.\n\nI'm a meek person in public. I'm not terribly outgoing, but I'll smile at people. If someone gets pissy I'm as like as not to just shrug and walk away. Sometimes my holster is so comfortable I forget it's there. I'm not \"on alert\" unless something unusual happens to get me there. I'm *never* looking for someone to shoot. I've been in two situations where I felt very threatened and had my gun on me (in one a dude was full-on charging at me and a friend) and I chose to retreat rather than to draw my firearm.\n\nI put on my gun expecting, *hoping* that I won't use it today. I keep my home defense weapon accessible, but fully knowing that I probably won't touch it except when I go out target shooting with my family. Half the time my friends (who know I carry) don't even know I'm carrying. My attitude doesn't change when I'm carrying. If anything, I'm more easygoing, because I know that if I do get into a confrontation, it can escalate faster if someone catches a glimpse of my gun, and I'm more eager to avoid them altogether. \n\nI am very careful with my gun. I bought one with a stiff, double-action trigger pull and a thumb safety on it  to minimize the risk of accidental discharge. I *never* point it at a living being unless I intend to kill it (I haven't so far. Hope I never have to.). I am fully aware of its destructive power and I treat it with the respect and care that deserves. \n\nI'm not hugely gun(g)-ho (sorry for the pun) about my right to carry. I want it respected. I'd like to be able to carry on school campuses and other places because I think it'd make them safer (it has on some private school campuses where carry is allowed in certain states). I'm not liable to shove my opinions down everyone's throat, or try to steer the conversation toward how much I love my gun. I'm pretty outspoken about my beliefs, but nine times out of ten I'll talk to you about something else before I talk to you about my guns.\n\nI don't think anyone's trying to take away my guns maliciously. I think that people who want gun control (and some gun control is *necessary*; it just boils down to how much is too much) want to reduce violence, which is a noble goal. I just think they're going about it the wrong way, mostly because they, like you, have some misunderstandings about your average gun owner. \n\nThat's my \"gun owner bio.\" I like to think I'm fairly typical of gun owners.  Now, to move on to your other arguments. Firstly, I'm going to wrap up the \"not all gun owners are rednecks\" thing:\n\nLike with just about any group, you're gonna see the most extreme ones. The guys that quietly carry, you're not gonna hear about, because they don't want to make a scene. You're going to hear about the ones that run around screaming \"THIS is why you concealed carry! If I'da been there I'da shot 'im dead!\" To be fair, guns are an expensive investment / hobby. There's a high barrier to entry, both in time and money, and the practice to keep up a decent marksmanship skill level is also a good-sized investment. So you're not going to get as many people who are \"meh\" about gun ownership. People that are \"meh\" are going to just... not buy one. You don't spend $300+, roughly 12 hours in a dull classroom, and over a month waiting on a thorough background check for something you feel \"meh\" about. (I say all this because this is what I went through to get my CCW permit and my handgun in NC. I realize getting long guns (non-Class 3 rifles, carbines and shotguns) is substantially cheaper and easier; but it's still an investment, and my point, I think, still stands.)\n\nThere is no such thing as an *obligation* to own a gun. Some people shouldn't own guns. For some people, that's because they're unstable and would be dangerous to themselves and others. For others, it's because they're too meek to pull the trigger on a person. And there's nothing at all wrong with that. Some people just aren't built to fight. \n\nNow... There is a *right* to bear arms, at least here in America. The fact is, guns are an equalizer. They give a 90-pound girl a fighting chance against the 250-pound linebacker if he decides he wants a piece of her. They also have the unfortunate effect of giving a 100-pound kid the ability to shoot up a school. *However,* the concealed carry activists aren't entirely (or even mostly) off base when they say \"this is why you should carry concealed.\" Each person carrying in a school or anywhere else is one more that can have a chance against an active shooter. Additionally, drawing and returning fire is usually enough to get a shooter to take cover, thus giving people time to escape; you don't even have to *hit* him, you can force him to keep his head down 'til police arrive. We call that suppressive fire.\n\nThe main thing about these gun-free zones like schools, state buildings and malls, is that they're not going to stop people who are out for blood. They're only going to stop law-abiding citizens. They effectively create an area where someone who wants to murder a bunch of people can walk in with a gun and have however long the typical police response time is to go on a no-holds-barred shooting spree. \n\nPepper some civilians like me in there, though, and you at least have someone who would slow them down. I consider my carrying a gun not just a right, but a responsibility; if I'm around and carrying when a shooting goes down, as one of the only people around equipped to stop it, that means, to me, that I *have* to try to stop it. That's going to result in me drawing the shooter's attention and maybe taking a bullet for you while I give you an opening to run. It might result in me dying if his aim and reaction time is better than mine. \n\nThat said, as someone who is carrying a deadly weapon, I also have a *very strong* responsibility to make sure that if I'm letting a bullet fly, I need to make sure it's only going to come to rest in a bad guy. That means not shooting into a crowd of people in hopes of hitting the shooter, and it also means making *absolutely sure* that he is a *direct* and *imminent* threat to innocent lives before I draw. \n\nNow, there are a few facts any responsible gun owner needs to understand. One of the main ones is that, statistically speaking, I am *much* more likely to harm myself or my family with my gun than I am to need it in a self defense situation. You might ask yourself, then, why do I carry, if I'm cognizant of this fact? \n\nWell, it's because that's an assumed risk, and it's one that I can directly mitigate. You pointed out that keeping your head on a swivel and not going into bad areas is a good way to stay safe. You're absolutely right. And even if I *am* carrying, I try to avoid going to places like that, because while I'd be willing to kill someone who was trying to hurt me or my friends / family, *I never want to have to do that,* for reasons practical, legal, and above all, moral and emotional. \n\nThat said, if I find that circumstances necessitate my going into a bad area, that gun at my hip makes me feel a *lot* safer. Additionally, people get assaulted in supposedly safe places all the time. Going back to the assumed risk thing, while you can never make absolutely sure that your home will never be invaded, or you'll never be mugged in the good part of town, you *can* make sure that you always treat your weapon with care and respect, which will mitigate or entirely remove the risk of accidental discharge and subsequent injury or death.\n\nSo to TL;DR that concept, even though the risk of self-injury is *statistically* higher because I own a firearm, I can *do* something about it to drastically reduce that risk.  \n\nLastly, to touch on your redneck thing again: You'll find that a lot of gun owners and concealed carriers are meek and mild, because they're familiar with the laws and they don't want to hurt people. You'll find that a lot of them (myself included) treat their gun with a level of care akin to a magical device. We don't wave them around. We don't threaten unless we truly feel we or someone near us are about to suffer grave bodily harm, death or sexual assault (the three legal threats that justify lethal force). We don't joke about shooting people with our gun. We make sure people *don't* see it, both for tactical reasons (if someone's gonna come in and shoot up the place, he's gonna take out the guy with the gun first), and for emotional ones (we know some people are scared of guns and we want to be courteous). \n\nStatistically, one in every 100 people you see has a concealed carry permit. That means we're not felons, and we've never been adjudicated mentally ill in a way that makes us a threat to ourselves or others. It means we care enough about it to get our permits renewed, and to pay for that process. If you see us on the street, you'll never know we're carrying, unless our shirt happens to ride up just right, or unless something violent goes down in our presence. We carry our guns \"just in case.\" And \"in case\" the day comes that we need our guns, well, there's plenty of news stories out there about people who lived when they otherwise would've died because they or someone around them was quietly, discreetly packing heat. "}, {"id": "cm2g0i8", "body": "Alright, so. First off, let me address your redneck / NRA gun nut problem.\n\nKnowing that I'm just some dude on the internet, I'm going to ask you to  believe that my self-description here is accurate.\n\nI'm at 25-year-old white guy living in NC. I was raised Republican, but recently voted a mostly-Democratic ticket. I don't like the rhetoric the NRA puts out, but they try to do good work in defending people's rights. Sometimes they succeed. I don't carry my gun to work (not allowed), but when I go out shopping or something, I strap my [Ruger LC9](http://www.ruger.com/products/lc9/models.html) into an inside-the-belt holster, drape my shirt over it and go.\n\nI'm a meek person in public. I'm not terribly outgoing, but I'll smile at people. If someone gets pissy I'm as like as not to just shrug and walk away. Sometimes my holster is so comfortable I forget it's there. I'm not \"on alert\" unless something unusual happens to get me there. I'm *never* looking for someone to shoot. I've been in two situations where I felt very threatened and had my gun on me (in one a dude was full-on charging at me and a friend) and I chose to retreat rather than to draw my firearm.\n\nI put on my gun expecting, *hoping* that I won't use it today. I keep my home defense weapon accessible, but fully knowing that I probably won't touch it except when I go out target shooting with my family. Half the time my friends (who know I carry) don't even know I'm carrying. My attitude doesn't change when I'm carrying. If anything, I'm more easygoing, because I know that if I do get into a confrontation, it can escalate faster if someone catches a glimpse of my gun, and I'm more eager to avoid them altogether. \n\nI am very careful with my gun. I bought one with a stiff, double-action trigger pull and a thumb safety on it  to minimize the risk of accidental discharge. I *never* point it at a living being unless I intend to kill it (I haven't so far. Hope I never have to.). I am fully aware of its destructive power and I treat it with the respect and care that deserves. \n\nI'm not hugely gun(g)-ho (sorry for the pun) about my right to carry. I want it respected. I'd like to be able to carry on school campuses and other places because I think it'd make them safer (it has on some private school campuses where carry is allowed in certain states). I'm not liable to shove my opinions down everyone's throat, or try to steer the conversation toward how much I love my gun. I'm pretty outspoken about my beliefs, but nine times out of ten I'll talk to you about something else before I talk to you about my guns.\n\nI don't think anyone's trying to take away my guns maliciously. I think that people who want gun control (and some gun control is *necessary*; it just boils down to how much is too much) want to reduce violence, which is a noble goal. I just think they're going about it the wrong way, mostly because they, like you, have some misunderstandings about your average gun owner. \n\nThat's my \"gun owner bio.\" I like to think I'm fairly typical of gun owners.  Now, to move on to your other arguments. Firstly, I'm going to wrap up the \"not all gun owners are rednecks\" thing:\n\nLike with just about any group, you're gonna see the most extreme ones. The guys that quietly carry, you're not gonna hear about, because they don't want to make a scene. You're going to hear about the ones that run around screaming \"THIS is why you concealed carry! If I'da been there I'da shot 'im dead!\" To be fair, guns are an expensive investment / hobby. There's a high barrier to entry, both in time and money, and the practice to keep up a decent marksmanship skill level is also a good-sized investment. So you're not going to get as many people who are \"meh\" about gun ownership. People that are \"meh\" are going to just... not buy one. You don't spend $300+, roughly 12 hours in a dull classroom, and over a month waiting on a thorough background check for something you feel \"meh\" about. (I say all this because this is what I went through to get my CCW permit and my handgun in NC. I realize getting long guns (non-Class 3 rifles, carbines and shotguns) is substantially cheaper and easier; but it's still an investment, and my point, I think, still stands.)\n\nThere is no such thing as an *obligation* to own a gun. Some people shouldn't own guns. For some people, that's because they're unstable and would be dangerous to themselves and others. For others, it's because they're too meek to pull the trigger on a person. And there's nothing at all wrong with that. Some people just aren't built to fight. \n\nNow...

Make changes to the Central Nervous System such that they cannot send their body commands. (The FBI refer to shooting the brain)\n2. Make changes to the Circulatory System such that any such commands cannot be carried out.

They may be the proverbial \"deadman walking,\" but there are a number of individuals on the rolls of Congressional Medal of Honor winners who did their thing *after* having received the wounds that killed them.\n\nSo that's it. Two ways to stop an attacker.  Only those two, and the second still allows for the possibility that the attacker could still cause you and yours significant harm.  \n\nI honestly cannot think of a way to quickly and effectively achieve one of those two goals without potentially lethal side effects.

Plenty of educated professionals own firearms. My hairdresser carried every day. Half of the engineers I work with have firearms. I wouldn't really call them rednecks. Anecdotal evidence is sufficient enough when you make a bold sweeping claim like \"only rednecks own guns.\"\n\n&gt; People say all the time, \"this is why you need concealed carry people!\" when there's an article about a robbery or a rape or whatever. What's the percentage or the statistics on actually becoming a victim of something like this, especially if you stay out of dark alleys, hang out with decent people, don't put yourself in dangerous situations etc etc.\n\nI'm not sure, but the mere existence of concealed carry in a population seems to be correlated strongly with reduced violent crime. Generally, criminals don't like to take as many chances when they know people could be armed, so says the theory. It could also be that criminals tend to get shot and stop committing crimes cause they're dead or scared. Whatever the mechanism, CC seems to correlate with a safer world to live in.\n\n&gt; I feel like, specifically home invasions, are done by people who know the victims and are out to get revenge or something similar.\n\nI would suggest doing some research before making a claim like this. My initial research shows at least 1/3 of cases are truly random, but I've been unable to quickly Google any good studies. Regardless of the source of home invasions, would you not want to have the ability to defend yourself?\n\n&gt;  So, based on statistics of becoming the victim of a crime, why do you need a gun?\n\nMany people don't feel they do. Nobody sane and pro-gun is going to say that everyone should own one. That'd be ridiculous. People should be free to make their own choices.\n\n&gt; Isn't there an alternative way to ward off an attacker that doesn't involve deadly force?\n\nIf you're an 80 yr old woman or a 95 lb teenage girl, there are not that many good options, and firearms are by far the most effective. If you prefer we return to the day and age before guns, where the primary weapons were swords, axes, daggers, and spears, we could do that - it'd just leave grandma completely dependent on others. Personally, I think that's a step backwards. I don't know how much of a feminist you are, but nothing empowers women more than the ability and right to defend themselves IMO.\n\n&gt; Help me change my view on gun culture and ownership (and bonus points for those who can change my views on rednecks). If it helps, I'm a white American (5th or 6th generation American at that) , 31/F, mother of one, married to a Hispanic man.\n\nThere are people who aren't interested in being gun owners that are fine with others being armed, and there are those who want to disarm everyone else because they're scared.

It seems like only rednecks own guns and spout off about how they're pro-guns, pro-NRA, etc. etc. (I can't, for the life of me, understand why a redneck has to hate anything that isn't white or Christian - but that's another post and I'm just adding that to help you with some background on why I don't get gun culture).\n\nPeople say all the time, \"this is why you need concealed carry people!\" when there's an article about a robbery or a rape or whatever.

If you don't maintain proper gun safety then I don't care what your points on owning your guns is.\n\nBackground. I was born in VA, no guns growing up, no hunting, no redneck upbringing. So I'll only touch on the necessity of owning a gun. Short sweet answer is, it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Rapes and home invasions are a rare thing for most people. Highly unlikely. However, guns are meant for unlikely situations. \n\nSituations like home invasions, burglarys, robberies do happen though. And I think the thought of having a gun is nicer than just hoping the police show up on time. Which, the more you go into the country, the longer the response time. So, having a firearm is a sense of security, a sense of control in an unlikely uncontrollable event, and a form of defense. \n\nLastly, guns are a way for the people to hold power in case the governement gets too ambitious and the people call for a revolution. Unlikely, but again, guns are for unlikely situations.\n\nI'm sure I've missed a few points but I will gladly debate further if you'd like. Anyway, this is how I see it.

Relatively few people in the USA that are murdered are actually killed because of money, and stranger killings are far less common than killings by friends and family. Your neighbors are far and away the most likely people to rob your house (that's why the neighborhood you live in has such a huge effect on whether your home is robbed). Remember that the people that do this stuff are lazy and stupid by definition. \n\nNo, the actual concern is the crazies, people that kill people because they want to kill people (serial killers) and these guys are thankfully quite rare. Getting a gun because you're worried about them is the same thing as worrying about lighting strikes and shark attacks. \n"}, {"id": "cm1fdfu", "body": "What about those who think someone is breaking into their home in the middle of the night, blindly grab their firearm and shoot, killing the \"intruder,\" who they later find out to be their own child or spouse..."}, {"id": "cm1g170", "body": "Well I don't think someone's response to a burglar should be to shoot first and ask questions later.

Blue-helmeted UN troops are not going to occupy the USA and take your guns. \n\n&gt; Anyway, I'm curious to know your experience with firearms that led you to hold your views so strongly? \n\nYou probably won't like the answer. \n\nI've got extensive experience with firearms. I was raised with guns in the home, taught gun safety at an early age, and shot rifles in Boy Scouts. I've also hunted quite a bit. My of my older friends growing up was a gun dealer with an incredibly extensive collection and another was a Army NCO that worked at an old ammo dump and we would occasionally go up there to fire off just about anything you can think of. I've also done a bit of quickdraw and Western style shooting. \n\nI fundamentally believe that most of the people in the USA that own firearms privately do so as a hobby. \"Self defense\" is a factor, but not the main reason most people own guns. Even hunting is a minority reason. And I just don't think the hobby of plinking justifies the collateral damage of having guns so prevalent. I've played paintball, shot airsoft and BB guns, etc. and those a fun hobbies too. \n\nI don't really care about the 2nd Amendment. It's irrelevant to whether or not gun control is a fundamentally good idea. \n\nI don't trust the police to protect me from harm, either. But I'm not really worried about someone busting into my house and murdering me because I know it's really unlikely. I also know from personal experience that people that have such things happen to them (like people busting into their house and trying to stab them) tend to \"draw\" those things to them. Weird violent incidents are a lot more common when you're a meth head. \n\nAnd I'm not for anything like a total gun ban. I'd just like to see a few incremental steps like registration (which I see is pretty basic) and limiting magazine size. I'd also like to ban cheap handguns, but that's a lot more controversial. \n\n"}, {"id": "cm1gp3g", "body": "Cars kill people, as well.

If their is we are simply replacing a tax on personal income with lawyer's fees.\n\nSecond we don't want money to sit idle or be put into passive investments.  The reason for this is that the more money that goes into passive investments the more they cost.  As we artificially raise their price because of favorable tax treatment we invite economic inefficiencies and bubbles.\n\nThird we do not want money to sit idle.  Money is kind of like energy in physics, it can never be destroyed, only change state.  A billion dollars sitting in a company's bank account or in government bonds COULD be out there buying capital equipment (the production of which creates jobs and the use of which creates jobs).  Having that money tied up not doing anything means that it has been removed from the economy and thus the job creating power it carries has been removed from the economy.

Our tax objective ought to be to find ways for companies to bring that money back into productive use (i.e. by getting rid of corporate taxes and replacing it with a penalty for sitting on cash).  You do that and boom! companies will start spending - or paying money out to shareholders who will in turn spend it - and we have a very positive economic feedback loop.\n\nInflation will not, unfortunately, correct this problem.

Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Like money, lack of it makes happiness more difficult, but having health just removes a hinderance.  And in both cases, there are plenty of people without health or money who are still happy.\n\nAnother problem with money is that you're never done getting richer.  As you get more money, you are exposed to people with even more money, and until you get to the top 100, this is always going to be true.  So, being satisfied with being \"rich\", for most people never happens, because there's still someone to compare themselves to.\n\nI've had the opportunity to know a number of obscenely rich people.  A good friend's father formed a multinational company and became a multi-billionaire.  He was happy because he was doing what he loved, but he was just as happy when the company was small.  Other people I've known were miserable bastards because they had no drive - they had plenty of money but their father was too busy making money to spend time with them, and there was no chance they'd ever be able to match their father's accomplishments.\n\nTake a look at the number of celebrities, worth millions, with throngs of adoring fans, who turn to drugs or suicide because, despite everything, they aren't happy.\n\nThe last thing to consider is that having money is a huge responsibility.  Friends ask you to help with their kid's cancer treatment, charities and causes hound you, relatives come out of the woodwork.  You have the ability to change the world - not just be a donor whose contribution pooled with others can make a difference, but, you yourself could keep an arts organization afloat or save a life.  How do you reconcile that with your desire to consume, to save some for those you love, and even to choose between causes?\n\nThe real danger is thinking in terms of \"if I just make 10k more (or 20k, or 50k or whatever) then I'll be happy\".

What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.

If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.

Sure, it might take money to do that - but it's not the money that's making you happy.   \n\nYou only need as much money as you need to achieve those objectives, no more.  It seems more of a warning against miserly boarding / penny pinching.  *Of course* if things else were equal, having more money is easier / more comfortable and may open doors."}, {"id": "2m5uxz", "body": "I understand that this has been posted on here, and I looked through all the posts of this same thing, and I haven't had my view changed. In this thread, I am going to actually try to change YOUR view, and hopefully you see a flaw in my thinking and change mine.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.

In the short run you'll like more money ($100k is obviously better than $99k) but in the long run your happiness setpoint will have changed, and you'll be no happier being rich than you would've been being middle class.  That does *not* mean you won't like material goods or derive pleasure from them.  We know you will.  The problem isn't that you value wealth - that's normal.  The problem is that even valuing wealth, getting more wealth won't make you happier in the long run.  Only in the short run.\n\nSimilarly, nobody would dare claim you are shallow to like having two legs.  But the fact appears to be that if you lose a leg you will not be made very unhappy in the long run.  You'll get used to having one leg.\n\nThere are some things which do not appear to be subject to the hedonic treadmill.  Your marriage is one of those: being married to someone wonderful will make you happier every day of your life (not just in the short run).  A commute is another: a bad commute sucks in a different way every day, and makes you unhappier in the long run. A good or bad job is another.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2m5uxz", "body": "I understand that this has been posted on here, and I looked through all the posts of this same thing, and I haven't had my view changed. In this thread, I am going to actually try to change YOUR view, and hopefully you see a flaw in my thinking and change mine.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You would not be showing up to the \"meh\" desk job, you would simply have different locations you could be currently working from. This is the problem. All that money and prestige must be leveraged into things that would perpetuate that money and prestige or it would disappear very quickly. Sure, you would be surrounded by expense, but only very rarely would you be able to actually relax and enjoy it.\n\nSpend some time in a position with an on-call rotation.

In this thread, I am going to actually try to change YOUR view, and hopefully you see a flaw in my thinking and change mine.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You get more value for your time and money by taking vacations or having an early retirement."}, {"id": "2m5uxz", "body": "I understand that this has been posted on here, and I looked through all the posts of this same thing, and I haven't had my view changed. In this thread, I am going to actually try to change YOUR view, and hopefully you see a flaw in my thinking and change mine.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But the term I think you are looking for is that money can ASSIST in the purchase of happiness for many people. For example, you can buy a plane ticket to Hawaii, and get a hotel room and a jetski and a coconut to bring home to your parents, but will the physical plane ticket make you happy? Unless you have a obsession with paper (I don't judge), it's not the ticket itself that makes you feel adventurous, excited, or even valuable. It's the abstract idea that the ticket represents for you, of this amazing journey to an island paradise that really makes you happy. Think of a torchbearer.

In this thread, I am going to actually try to change YOUR view, and hopefully you see a flaw in my thinking and change mine.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you think that doing something or making more money will bring you happiness then sure maybe for a second or two, maybe for a day at the most and then you go back to looking for that happiness high again.  Ask yourself, the last time you were saving up for something you considered expenaive and then you finally got it. How long were you happy for? It couldn't have been more than a week. You will keep on looking for more unendingly. But when the job itself gives you an internal fulfillment without regard for external motivations (ie. Money, promise of fame... Etc) then the reward of happiness comes daily.  But this is not happiness it is almost suffering. A musician or an accountant who loves his or her job struggles and suffers and works long hard hours. This doesn't sound like happiness to another person but for them they find the fulfillment in doing what they do, not in a reward that comes after. They wake up excited to go to \"work\" because it's indifferent from play.  Either way when someone is so focused and determined out of their own will to do whatever job, they will be pushing it to the limits of their capabilities as opposed to someone who is just doing it for the money.\nDon't get me wrong. YES it is important to have enough money to survive.\nSo if you mean money can buy a short window of happiness then sure; fancy houses, cars, drugs, alcohol, jewelry,vacations etc.\nBut those are things that put you in a transient state of happiness. Why not be happy everyday? :) namaste"}, {"id": "2m5uxz", "body": "I understand that this has been posted on here, and I looked through all the posts of this same thing, and I haven't had my view changed. In this thread, I am going to actually try to change YOUR view, and hopefully you see a flaw in my thinking and change mine.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Take for example you are rich and you own a company. If you want more money, you can do this easily by lowering the pay of your workers and giving it all to yourself. As a capitalist, you're going to have the power to make other people's lives either better and worse, and lots of capitalists decide to make other people's lives worse. That's why lots of people hate people like you, who only care to enrich themselves, oftentimes at the expense of others. \n\n\nIf you're rich, you're probably a *capitalist*. You probably own property or businesses or something that automatically generates money for you. For example, my friend's mother hardly works at all. She just owns several hotels and gets rich off of them. For example, I know lots of people who invest in real estate (myself included). The entire point of this investment is that you basically rent out the property and make more money than you spend. You're hardly lifting a finger but you could be making thousands upon thousands of dollars. \n\nEvery time you profit off somebody else as a capitalist, you've pretty much made an unequal trade agreement with your client, in that they'll pay you more money for the service than it's worth. You'll make a similar agreement with your employees - you will pay them less than the value they give, so you can make a profit. By being a capitalist, you must necessarily be *unfair* to make money. \n\n\nThis sort of unfairness will not go unnoticed by your employees or your clients. As a capitalist, you will be resented for your ability to force these unfair trade agreements because you have the capital power to do so.\n\n\nYou'll have trouble keeping your old friends because of the class divide. You'll make new, rich friends. Your old friends won't be able to keep up with your spending habits. They'll probably resent you for leaving them behind to pursue your materialism. Moreover, people will resent the fact that you're such high maintenance. Average people don't need million dollar cars or houses. We call this sort of characteristic *greed*, and it indeed is a vice. \n\n\nI mean, nobody's stopping you from believing what you do. But if you told me that the most important thing for you was money, I'd have to reconsider being your friend. You're not offending my sensibilities, I just don't want to associate with people like that. Your sort of attitude is also more pervasive in the lower classes that never had money. Middle and upper class people never say that they want more money, because they've always had plenty. \n\n\nIn summary, when you hold money to the highest esteem, you are seen as:\n\n1. Greedy by the lower, middle, and working class\n\n2. Uncultured by the upper class\n\n3. A sellout by your friends\n\n4. Lacking empathy/class consciousness by Liberals/socialists\n\n5. Lacking moral character by putting yourself over others. \n\n\nI mean, I don't think it's wrong that you value something, but just realize not everybody is going to value money and that many people will hold it against you for various reasons. \n\n"}, {"id": "2m5uxz", "body": "I understand that this has been posted on here, and I looked through all the posts of this same thing, and I haven't had my view changed.

Lets say I wanted to spend the next 60 years on a super yacht, eating food made by a dedicated full time chef, drinking the very best liquors, and constantly being serviced by the most expensive of prostitutes.  How much would that cost?  The answer to that question by my thinking is in the order of 60 million dollars.\n\nHere is the thing though: would that lifestyle bring me happiness?  First lets talk about the hookers.  Sex is great, everyone loves sex, but you also want an actual romantic relationship with a woman who is smart, vibrant, and challenges you to expand your horizons.  Unfortunately a woman like that isn't going to be agreeable with an endless stream of hookers in my life.  So I am going to have to make a choice - no matter how much money I have - between a genuine loving relationship and endless hookers.  How i imagine everyone is going to have their own (strong) opinion on which choice is right or wrong but each one carries trade-offs.  I can't have everything I have to give up something and money can't change that.\n\nNext lets talk about the booze: I don't want to be an alcoholic and I don't want to miss out enjoying all the sex/food/yacht I have so really only a few drinks a day is going to be practical for me.\n\nThen the food... ohh food a vice all share...  Yet I don't want to be fat.  It isn't just about how the hookers would see me either it is a self image thing.  You want to feel strong, sexy, powerful, and that sadly means that while you can eat delicious food you can't eat much of it.\n\nSo suddenly everything I want has to be taken in moderation.  I can't simply take 60 million dollars and trade it for a life of great food, drink, travel and endless sex.  I have to make tradeoffs, set priorities, have unfulfilled wants.\n\nNow lets dial it back even further.  What would it mean if I wanted to reliably make 20-40 million dollars over a lifetime of work (to guarantee i am rich instead of taking my chances on the stock market or as an entrepreneur)?  It would mean I need to make really solid six figures.  There are a lot of jobs out there with that kind of pay but all of them require working 12 hour days 6 days a week.  Suddenly with sleeping and time to just unwind mindlessly after work I have a very limited amount of free time available to me.  I might get a solid 12 hours a week to do whatever I want (if i am lucky).  So what am I going to do?  In those 12 hours I can do anything and have virtually unlimited money to do it.  The problem is I can't fly to paris and back in 12 hours.  I can't hop on a yacht full of hookers if i decided i need a committed relationship (in fact my SO's ideas about what to do with the spare time are going to be very important).\n\nYou see where I am going with this?  At some point it is going to boil down to a few hours a week of real freedom to do whatever you want vs. having a job you love doing day in day out.\n\nYes it is better to have money than not, but at the same time I think you will find you can maximize pleasure in your life by \"earning\" pleasure from work and settling for less money in your \"free\" time than trying to earn all your pleasure in life from a couple of hours a week."}, {"id": "2m5uxz", "body": "I understand that this has been posted on here, and I looked through all the posts of this same thing, and I haven't had my view changed. In this thread, I am going to actually try to change YOUR view, and hopefully you see a flaw in my thinking and change mine.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, you can think I am a shallow, cocky loser, thats fine. But let me preface this by saying I do not mean to offend anyone, and I respect all other ideas, but I would appreciate someone to attempt to change my view, because I love a good debate and am planning to write my Master's Thesis revolving around this idea.  Having been told that my ideas are shallow and I will fail with this mindset, I have been thoroughly offended and do not understand the hypocrisy with which this idea has been regarded.\n\nLet's start with where my stance all began.  I remember sitting in my first college classroom on the first day.  I was in a room of 50 some people that I never met, and listening to a woman give us some \"first day of college\" advice. It was all great stuff about how to be a great student, and I appreciated this woman, and then she said something that piqued my interest.  \"Don't major in something for the money and the job that may come with it, major in a field you love, because that will make you happy.\"  Hm..I thought to myself...\"What if money makes me happy?\" \n\nThe teacher then went on to a mini little talk about careers and college majors and all that good stuff.  She listed different things to consider when trying to decide on a career/major.  She told the class that a job should cater to your values as a person..hmm.\n\nHere's where it got interesting.  She said that if you love spending time with your family, and you get a job that makes you work 80 hours a week...you're not going to be happy.  If you love being outside and adventurous, and you get a job as an accountant, you're not going to be happy. If you see value in being a people person and dealing with different customers for a living, but you get a job as an office worker, you won't be happy.\n\nWell, ma'am, what if I value money?\n\nHere's my view. If you find happiness in spending time with your family and you could not care less about having a Ferrari, a nice house, and a lavish lifestyle, dude, that's great.  I envy people who aren't materialistic, I really do.  If you LOVE being outdoors and adventurous and don't care about money, as long as your salary is enough to live, honestly man more power to you.  If you love your median paying job as a salesman because you love dealing with different customers and stuff and THAT is *your* happiness, I can respect the shit out of that. \n\nBut when *I* come around and say that *my* happiness can be bought by money, and that I can honestly say that if I had all the money I want, I would be able to be truly happy, its not valid? Why is that not a valid view on happiness.  If you're going to get technical and say that money is buying me THINGS which are making me happy, then that's not a counterargument. Come on, money buys your things that make you happy.  \n\nIf you seriously do not give one tiny shit about material possessions and are fine with an average lifestyle, I envy you.  I personally value prestige and money, and I just do not see why that is any less valid than someone who values their family, or a job that they love. \n\nOkay, guys do not get me wrong here, I LOVE my family, and I would obviously prefer to have a job I love, but if you're telling me I have to show up to a \"meh\" desk job in my quarter million dollar car that I drove from me 8 million dollar house, wearing my $6,000 suit and my $30,000 watch...I'm gonna be honest with you...I would be okay with that. I'm not gonna say I would do a job that I absolutely HATE, but lets face it, very few people do what they really really LOVE, so why not suck it up and try to make the most money possible?\n\nIf you try to feed me statistics about how the diminishing marginal utility of money flatlines around 80k or whatever, it doesn't work that way.  That study is an average, and it is not indicative of every person's values.\n\nI think it is naive to say that money doesn't buy happiness as a blanket statement. Sure, there are people who REALLY do not need money to be happy, nor will an influx of money in their pocket make them happier, fine.  I see that, I respect the hell out of it, and I envy it.  \n\nBut to say that my (or anyone else's) idea is not valid that money WILL inevitably bring happiness, and a lot of it, is naive, and it crosses into the realm of offensive when people say its shallow.  What makes valuing money so shallow? Its gonna make me HAPPY.  Spending time with your kids makes you happy, so you work a 40 hours a week job, make a decent salary and call it a day.  That's GREAT, honestly, its awesome that you can do what makes *you* happy.  If I want to work 60+ hours a week at a job I may not like *that* much, and make a few million a year (Yes, this is not common at ALL, but for the sake of the argument here, just go with it), why is that not okay for me live by?\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: When people talk about what makes them happy, pretty much any answer except \"money\" is acceptable, and I am offended that this is the case.  Seeking money as a happiness and valuing it as such does not make me any better or worse than the person who finds happiness in other things. \n\nFor those of you who actually read this, thank you, and I respect your opinions. I did not mean to offend anybody, only to clear the air.\n\n\nEDIT: To be clear, yes, I obviously won't be happy sitting around a bunch of green dollar bills, and it is the things I do with the money that makes me happy.  I am aware of this.  This is why the quote \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" irks me, because yes, for some people, it definitely does buy happiness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Obviously the marginal utility of money is different from person to person and there are those who will find marginal utility well past the 80k average limit. You happen to be on that end of the distribution. There's really not much more to say about the issue than that.

You can't find the other man. You exclaim, \"What the hell are you talking about? I don't see anybody else!\" Bob just says, \"I know he's there. Just believe me!\"\n\nAfter going through the scenario above, why the hell would anybody be \"agnostic\" about the existence of a third man? As you search more and more vigorously and find no results, agnosticism quickly turns gnostic. The 3rd man doesn't exist. There's no reason to be \"unsure\" about this fact. \n\n\n\nThe same argument, IMO, can be applied to the nebulous concept known as \"God\". Sure, it's impossible to disprove the existence of God-like entities - concepts that share interesting features of God but are in no way, shape, or form any way related to the personal Gods (such as Allah or Yahweh) as believed by human society. Outside of philosophy, I don't see why anybody would be particularly interested in this form of God that has absolutely no practical consequence on humanity. What I'm interested in is the Gods that people actually believe in - the personal God that affects your daily life, that personally intervenes in your life to make it better, the one that's here to save your soul. \n\n\nI spent a good chunk of my life trying to find Yahweh or any other God. I couldn't find any sign of him whatsoever in this universe that we inhabit. And not only me, no scientist has found much of a trace of Him. Most Churches can't even find him either - instead, they must rely on Faith that He is there.\n\nIs it possible that \"personal Gods\" exist? Maybe. But as the search for that personal God continues, the probability that He exists diminishes to zero. How many times must I re-scan that dark room of Alex and Bob to ensure that the 3rd man does not exist? Every single lack of observation reaffirms the positive belief that \"No, the third man does not exist\", just like \"The Personal God does not exist\".\n\n\n\n\nWith new and updated observations of reality that continue to yield absolutely no evidence of God, the probability of the existence of God continues to diminish to zero. The discovery of classical mechanics proved that God wasn't needed to *actively* move heaven and Earth. The discovery of Evolution proved that God was not needed to actively create Life. Each new discovery reaffirms the fact that God does not intervene in the natural world using \"unnatural\" means. Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"mechanism that which drives the laws of nature\". Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"Universe\". But that sure is hell far, far away from the God of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and everyone else that believe in Gods. \n\nAtheism permits the possible existence of super-powerful, God-like creatures that may share many or even all of the features that are attributed to God. It's not unimaginable that an alien race has achieved such incredible powers to be even more powerful than the God as described in the Old Testament. These \"Gods\" may be so incredibly intelligent or powerful that they are unimaginable by human intelligence. But they're not supernatural. They're not the personal God believed by humanity that reincarnates you or whisks you off to heaven. I'm also sure you've heard of the simulation argument, that there is a \"super-universe\" on top of ours that controls us, much like how we play videogames that create \"sub-universes\" that we have near total control over. However, this version of God is in great contrast to the God imagined by most people. Most people don't believe that God is a supernatural Nerd playing his world's version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\". I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of gnostic atheists all can permit these kind of \"nearly supernatural\" beings to exist. Hell, why not describe Jesus Christ as a space alien that decided to land on Earth to fuck with the natives? But even if Alien Jesus shares all the same attributes as the actual Jesus, for some reason, it's different. Alien Jesus loses that sort of \"supernatural mystery\" that is the crux of atheist antipathy towards religion. \n\n\n\nGnostic atheism is defensible. We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man. Alex is fucking sure the 3rd man simply is not there! \n\n\nHumanity always strives to learn more and more about the world they live in and the universe in general. Agnostics throw their hands in the air and say, \"We don't know!\" Gnostic atheists continue the search for God - and when each search yields no results, their belief is reaffirmed that God does not exist. You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm only arguing about semantics here. But I'm tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \n\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God. They just decided either to believe or not to care. But IMO, any person that actively searches for God's existence will eventually become an atheist, because every time he looks, nothing is found. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man. Alex is fucking sure the 3rd man simply is not there! \n\n\nHumanity always strives to learn more and more about the world they live in and the universe in general. Agnostics throw their hands in the air and say, \"We don't know!\" Gnostic atheists continue the search for God - and when each search yields no results, their belief is reaffirmed that God does not exist. You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm only arguing about semantics here. But I'm tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \n\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God. They just decided either to believe or not to care. But IMO, any person that actively searches for God's existence will eventually become an atheist, because every time he looks, nothing is found. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "2m5qjh", "body": "Imagine you, Alex, and another man, Bob, sitting in a dark room. Bob suddenly exclaims, \"There's someone else in this room!\" Alarmed, you turn on your flashlight to look for this other man. You run about the room, trying to find him, but you cannot. You can't find the other man. You exclaim, \"What the hell are you talking about? I don't see anybody else!\" Bob just says, \"I know he's there. Just believe me!\"\n\nAfter going through the scenario above, why the hell would anybody be \"agnostic\" about the existence of a third man? As you search more and more vigorously and find no results, agnosticism quickly turns gnostic. The 3rd man doesn't exist. There's no reason to be \"unsure\" about this fact. \n\n\n\nThe same argument, IMO, can be applied to the nebulous concept known as \"God\". Sure, it's impossible to disprove the existence of God-like entities - concepts that share interesting features of God but are in no way, shape, or form any way related to the personal Gods (such as Allah or Yahweh) as believed by human society. Outside of philosophy, I don't see why anybody would be particularly interested in this form of God that has absolutely no practical consequence on humanity. What I'm interested in is the Gods that people actually believe in - the personal God that affects your daily life, that personally intervenes in your life to make it better, the one that's here to save your soul. \n\n\nI spent a good chunk of my life trying to find Yahweh or any other God. I couldn't find any sign of him whatsoever in this universe that we inhabit. And not only me, no scientist has found much of a trace of Him. Most Churches can't even find him either - instead, they must rely on Faith that He is there.\n\nIs it possible that \"personal Gods\" exist? Maybe. But as the search for that personal God continues, the probability that He exists diminishes to zero. How many times must I re-scan that dark room of Alex and Bob to ensure that the 3rd man does not exist? Every single lack of observation reaffirms the positive belief that \"No, the third man does not exist\", just like \"The Personal God does not exist\".\n\n\n\n\nWith new and updated observations of reality that continue to yield absolutely no evidence of God, the probability of the existence of God continues to diminish to zero. The discovery of classical mechanics proved that God wasn't needed to *actively* move heaven and Earth. The discovery of Evolution proved that God was not needed to actively create Life. Each new discovery reaffirms the fact that God does not intervene in the natural world using \"unnatural\" means. Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"mechanism that which drives the laws of nature\". Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"Universe\". But that sure is hell far, far away from the God of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and everyone else that believe in Gods. \n\nAtheism permits the possible existence of super-powerful, God-like creatures that may share many or even all of the features that are attributed to God. It's not unimaginable that an alien race has achieved such incredible powers to be even more powerful than the God as described in the Old Testament. These \"Gods\" may be so incredibly intelligent or powerful that they are unimaginable by human intelligence. But they're not supernatural. They're not the personal God believed by humanity that reincarnates you or whisks you off to heaven. I'm also sure you've heard of the simulation argument, that there is a \"super-universe\" on top of ours that controls us, much like how we play videogames that create \"sub-universes\" that we have near total control over. However, this version of God is in great contrast to the God imagined by most people. Most people don't believe that God is a supernatural Nerd playing his world's version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\". I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of gnostic atheists all can permit these kind of \"nearly supernatural\" beings to exist. Hell, why not describe Jesus Christ as a space alien that decided to land on Earth to fuck with the natives? But even if Alien Jesus shares all the same attributes as the actual Jesus, for some reason, it's different. Alien Jesus loses that sort of \"supernatural mystery\" that is the crux of atheist antipathy towards religion. \n\n\n\nGnostic atheism is defensible. We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man. Alex is fucking sure the 3rd man simply is not there! \n\n\nHumanity always strives to learn more and more about the world they live in and the universe in general. Agnostics throw their hands in the air and say, \"We don't know!\" Gnostic atheists continue the search for God - and when each search yields no results, their belief is reaffirmed that God does not exist. You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm only arguing about semantics here. But I'm tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \n\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God. They just decided either to believe or not to care. But IMO, any person that actively searches for God's existence will eventually become an atheist, because every time he looks, nothing is found. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is vital that we recognize our emotional insides, and even more than recognize them, *be* with them. Which is a strange assertion from a \"pure intellect\" viewpoint, in which things may be seen instantaneously and \"being with something\" happens at the speed of visual acuity. It means to slow down, to give credence to the meditators, the yogis, the mystics, to be humble, to let the beautiful soul of the world (soul in this context being the soul a jazz musician would refer to, blue notes dripping from the air and arising-curling like smoke from where they touch the scorched earth) *find you*, and realize that often any attempts to *understand* it will remove you from understanding, will remove you from a very real but very subtle and unfathomable part of the world.\n\nNote on your [0]: Familiar with Godel's incompleteness theorem? Basically, all formal systems must contain contradictions and paradoxes. If they do not, they are limited in scope. Logical systems are either inconsistent or incomplete."}, {"id": "cm1lmtg", "body": "&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by a logical/mathematical approach to reality.\n\nI meant a logical/mathematical approach to *existence*, not reality. Let me try to illustrate what I mean.\n\nAs a mathematician, I'm used to statements like \"there exist infinitely many prime numbers\". Within the proper logical context, this is statement with a precise meaning, and it happens to be true. Numbers exist in a logical/mathematical sense. I can say \"the number two exists\"; and it does (within the proper context), and I am justified in using the definite article \"the\", because there is only one number two.\n\nHowever, numbers do *not* exist physically. There is no object in the physical universe which you can point to and reasonably claim \"this is the number two\". There are plenty of *representations* of the number two, and there are plenty of sets of objects with cardinality two, and so on, but *the number two itself* is not a physical object. Numbers are not physically real objects.\n\nSo when I say I'm taking a logical/mathematical approach to *existence*, I'm saying things like \"our universe exists in a mathematical sense\", by which I mean that our universe is an (incredibly complicated) object that exists in some logical system.\n\nThings within our universe exist both in the reality sense *and* in the mathematical sense.\n\nI believe that this kind of thinking helps to clarify the questions of \"why does our universe exist\" and \"why does our universe exist in the form that it has\" (by the way: I strongly feel that the second questions is ultimately the more useful one for any philosophical inquiry)\n\n&gt; Even logic, while having strict rules at the lowest levels of granularity, does not inherently \"know\" how to build those rules into recognizable, useful forms. We the participants engage in building logical systems to understand the world.\n\nThere is a lot of truth in that.\n\n&gt; And tend to make loads of assumptions we aren't aware we're making. There's a \"quantum weirdness\" here, where observer and observed are bizarrely entangled, and re-writing each other's rules on the fly.\n\nI guess this is where we diverge. Our built-in assumptions and out nature as observers affect the kind of logical systems we care about and we choose to investigate. However, we do not *change* the logical systems.\n\nIf we decide to abandon e.g. set theory in favor of type theory as a foundation of mathematics, this changes neither set theory nor type theory.\n\n\n&gt; Note on your [0]: Familiar with Godel's incompleteness theorem? Basically, all formal systems must contain contradictions and paradoxes. If they do not, they are limited in scope. Logical systems are either inconsistent or incomplete.\n\nA better phrasing of Godel's incompleteness theorem is: Every logically consistent and sufficiently expressive logical system allows the formulation of statements such that neither the statement nor its logical negation can be proven (within that system) - i.e., the statement is undecidable within/independent from the system.\n\nWe expect the logical systems in common use to be logically consistent (though obviously this cannot *really* be proven and requires some amount of faith), and we have examples where naturally occurring statements have been shown to be undecidable. This is neat, but I don't see how it affects the rest of the line of thought that I was expressing. Care to explain?\n\n\n&gt; &gt; I'm sure that believing in a god has certain emotional benefits to many people.\n\n&gt; You're thinking about it backwards. It would be a Herculean feat of logic and iron-will to decide rationally that \"my emotional processes, and statistical longevity, will be bolstered if I decide to believe in a god or god-set.\"\n\nThis isn't what I meant. What I meant is simply that believing in a god has certain emotional benefits to many people.\n\nI did not mean to imply anything about *why* those people ended up with their belief."}, {"id": "2m5qjh", "body": "Imagine you, Alex, and another man, Bob, sitting in a dark room. Bob suddenly exclaims, \"There's someone else in this room!\" Alarmed, you turn on your flashlight to look for this other man. You run about the room, trying to find him, but you cannot. You can't find the other man. You exclaim, \"What the hell are you talking about? I don't see anybody else!\" Bob just says, \"I know he's there. Just believe me!\"\n\nAfter going through the scenario above, why the hell would anybody be \"agnostic\" about the existence of a third man? As you search more and more vigorously and find no results, agnosticism quickly turns gnostic. The 3rd man doesn't exist. There's no reason to be \"unsure\" about this fact. \n\n\n\nThe same argument, IMO, can be applied to the nebulous concept known as \"God\". Sure, it's impossible to disprove the existence of God-like entities - concepts that share interesting features of God but are in no way, shape, or form any way related to the personal Gods (such as Allah or Yahweh) as believed by human society. Outside of philosophy, I don't see why anybody would be particularly interested in this form of God that has absolutely no practical consequence on humanity. What I'm interested in is the Gods that people actually believe in - the personal God that affects your daily life, that personally intervenes in your life to make it better, the one that's here to save your soul. \n\n\nI spent a good chunk of my life trying to find Yahweh or any other God. I couldn't find any sign of him whatsoever in this universe that we inhabit. And not only me, no scientist has found much of a trace of Him. Most Churches can't even find him either - instead, they must rely on Faith that He is there.\n\nIs it possible that \"personal Gods\" exist? Maybe. But as the search for that personal God continues, the probability that He exists diminishes to zero. How many times must I re-scan that dark room of Alex and Bob to ensure that the 3rd man does not exist? Every single lack of observation reaffirms the positive belief that \"No, the third man does not exist\", just like \"The Personal God does not exist\".\n\n\n\n\nWith new and updated observations of reality that continue to yield absolutely no evidence of God, the probability of the existence of God continues to diminish to zero. The discovery of classical mechanics proved that God wasn't needed to *actively* move heaven and Earth. The discovery of Evolution proved that God was not needed to actively create Life. Each new discovery reaffirms the fact that God does not intervene in the natural world using \"unnatural\" means. Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"mechanism that which drives the laws of nature\". Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"Universe\". But that sure is hell far, far away from the God of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and everyone else that believe in Gods. \n\nAtheism permits the possible existence of super-powerful, God-like creatures that may share many or even all of the features that are attributed to God. It's not unimaginable that an alien race has achieved such incredible powers to be even more powerful than the God as described in the Old Testament. These \"Gods\" may be so incredibly intelligent or powerful that they are unimaginable by human intelligence. But they're not supernatural. They're not the personal God believed by humanity that reincarnates you or whisks you off to heaven. I'm also sure you've heard of the simulation argument, that there is a \"super-universe\" on top of ours that controls us, much like how we play videogames that create \"sub-universes\" that we have near total control over. However, this version of God is in great contrast to the God imagined by most people. Most people don't believe that God is a supernatural Nerd playing his world's version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\". I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of gnostic atheists all can permit these kind of \"nearly supernatural\" beings to exist. Hell, why not describe Jesus Christ as a space alien that decided to land on Earth to fuck with the natives? But even if Alien Jesus shares all the same attributes as the actual Jesus, for some reason, it's different. Alien Jesus loses that sort of \"supernatural mystery\" that is the crux of atheist antipathy towards religion. \n\n\n\nGnostic atheism is defensible. We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man. Alex is fucking sure the 3rd man simply is not there! \n\n\nHumanity always strives to learn more and more about the world they live in and the universe in general. Agnostics throw their hands in the air and say, \"We don't know!\" Gnostic atheists continue the search for God - and when each search yields no results, their belief is reaffirmed that God does not exist. You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm only arguing about semantics here. But I'm tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \n\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God. They just decided either to believe or not to care. But IMO, any person that actively searches for God's existence will eventually become an atheist, because every time he looks, nothing is found. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\". I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of gnostic atheists all can permit these kind of \"nearly supernatural\" beings to exist. Hell, why not describe Jesus Christ as a space alien that decided to land on Earth to fuck with the natives?

Alien Jesus loses that sort of \"supernatural mystery\" that is the crux of atheist antipathy towards religion. \n\n\n\nGnostic atheism is defensible. We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man.

Rather, the agnostic position is to avoid making unnecessary assumptions while doing the searching.

As you search more and more vigorously and find no results, agnosticism quickly turns gnostic. The 3rd man doesn't exist. There's no reason to be \"unsure\" about this fact. \n\n\n\nThe same argument, IMO, can be applied to the nebulous concept known as \"God\". Sure, it's impossible to disprove the existence of God-like entities - concepts that share interesting features of God but are in no way, shape, or form any way related to the personal Gods (such as Allah or Yahweh) as believed by human society. Outside of philosophy, I don't see why anybody would be particularly interested in this form of God that has absolutely no practical consequence on humanity. What I'm interested in is the Gods that people actually believe in - the personal God that affects your daily life, that personally intervenes in your life to make it better, the one that's here to save your soul. \n\n\nI spent a good chunk of my life trying to find Yahweh or any other God. I couldn't find any sign of him whatsoever in this universe that we inhabit. And not only me, no scientist has found much of a trace of Him. Most Churches can't even find him either - instead, they must rely on Faith that He is there.\n\nIs it possible that \"personal Gods\" exist? Maybe. But as the search for that personal God continues, the probability that He exists diminishes to zero. How many times must I re-scan that dark room of Alex and Bob to ensure that the 3rd man does not exist? Every single lack of observation reaffirms the positive belief that \"No, the third man does not exist\", just like \"The Personal God does not exist\".\n\n\n\n\nWith new and updated observations of reality that continue to yield absolutely no evidence of God, the probability of the existence of God continues to diminish to zero. The discovery of classical mechanics proved that God wasn't needed to *actively* move heaven and Earth. The discovery of Evolution proved that God was not needed to actively create Life. Each new discovery reaffirms the fact that God does not intervene in the natural world using \"unnatural\" means. Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"mechanism that which drives the laws of nature\". Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"Universe\". But that sure is hell far, far away from the God of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and everyone else that believe in Gods. \n\nAtheism permits the possible existence of super-powerful, God-like creatures that may share many or even all of the features that are attributed to God. It's not unimaginable that an alien race has achieved such incredible powers to be even more powerful than the God as described in the Old Testament. These \"Gods\" may be so incredibly intelligent or powerful that they are unimaginable by human intelligence. But they're not supernatural. They're not the personal God believed by humanity that reincarnates you or whisks you off to heaven. I'm also sure you've heard of the simulation argument, that there is a \"super-universe\" on top of ours that controls us, much like how we play videogames that create \"sub-universes\" that we have near total control over. However, this version of God is in great contrast to the God imagined by most people. Most people don't believe that God is a supernatural Nerd playing his world's version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\". I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of gnostic atheists all can permit these kind of \"nearly supernatural\" beings to exist. Hell, why not describe Jesus Christ as a space alien that decided to land on Earth to fuck with the natives? But even if Alien Jesus shares all the same attributes as the actual Jesus, for some reason, it's different. Alien Jesus loses that sort of \"supernatural mystery\" that is the crux of atheist antipathy towards religion. \n\n\n\nGnostic atheism is defensible. We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man. Alex is fucking sure the 3rd man simply is not there! \n\n\nHumanity always strives to learn more and more about the world they live in and the universe in general. Agnostics throw their hands in the air and say, \"We don't know!\" Gnostic atheists continue the search for God - and when each search yields no results, their belief is reaffirmed that God does not exist. You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm only arguing about semantics here. But I'm tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \n\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God.

We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\".

You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would.

This is because knowledge, true and objective knowledge, I  feel, is impossible to actually achieve. It might be out there, it might exist, but even if it did, there would be no way we as human beings would be able to access it. \n\nThis is because to truly know something, fully and completely without any room for any doubt whatsoever, requires us to possess pretty much total omniscience. This is because true knowledge must account for not only the things we already know we don't know, but also for the things we don't know we don't know--the unknown unknowns. By definition, an unknown unknown is, well, unknown. If it were possible to account for an unknown unknown, then it would become a known unknown, and would no longer be in the realm of things we don't know we don't know. And since these are, once again, unknowable, this also means we don't know how many unknown unknowns there are. There will never be a point where we can be certain we've accounted for every unknown unknown out there, because these are unknown to us. The only way this is possible is with total omniscience. \n\nEven if we assumed that there could theoretically be one person with perfect knowledge, that knowledge must necessarily be expressed through language, which will inevitably introduce errors and misunderstandings due to its inherently subjective nature. Every premise is its own conclusion--even the ancient Greeks knew that this was a problem if we expect language to convey not just meaning but knowledge--and so every argument, because they are made of language, can spiral out into infinity. \n\nBecause knowledge, true knowledge, is impossible, this must also include knowledge of God's existence or non-existence. Therefore, it is impossible to know 100 percent whether or not there is a god. \n\nOf course, one might think that, no, there are some things we can know with 100 percent certainty. All bachelors are unmarried, for example. These and other analytic truths, though, are rarely useful for everyday living and instead are generally just cute little exercises that have little to no applicability to real life. Further, many times they are simply tautologies: all bachelors are unmarried because all bachelors are unmarried. Finally, even analytic truths may contain their own set of unknown unknowns. Descartes famously argued that, while he may believe that all triangles have three sides, there could theoretically be some sort of bizarre circumstance where, perhaps, he and everyone else was brain damaged to believe it, or there was some cosmic being that tricks everyone into believing it. He said that he knows, but said there was the possibility that something could only be deceiving him into thinking he knows. \n\nNow, with this in mind, how does anyone get anything done? By understanding and accepting that our standard for knowledge need not be 100 percent. I cannot actually be sure that you're a real person, and I'm not just replying to, say, a computer program or even a hallucination on my part. I can't know, 100 percent, that I'm not really in bed dreaming all this. I can't know, 100 percent, that you're not a particularly agile houseplant. We can't have true. But we *can* have \"true enough for our purposes.\" Sure, I can't know any of these things, but for the sake of argument, and for the sake of actually being able to live life, let's just assume you're a real person. This idea of instrumental truth is a wonderful bridge between the extreme skepticism that must accompany an intellectually honest view of our own knowledge, and the massive assumptions that empiricism makes about the nature of knowledge (such as the reliability of our senses, and that our senses give us an objective view of the world). Instrumental truth is enough to get us by in 99.9 percent of cases. \n\nGod, however, is not one of these cases. If we're going to really examine God in a true triple-omni setup, nothing less than 100 percent philosophical certainty will do because even the tiniest wiggle room can break the entire argument considering we're discussing a being that, by definition, can do anything. An all-powerful God, if we're going to approach this seriously, could reasonably shield its presence from anything and anyone, whether empirically or analytically. An all-powerful God could indeed be above logic and rules, capable of both making a stone so heavy it cannot lift it, and then lifting it. \n\nAnd so, it is impossible to know with 100 percent certainty that God does or does not exist, just as even if we assumed God did exist, it would be impossible to know anything about the nature of this entity. So, even if God did exist, it's very unlikely this being would have a personal relationship with anyone. \n\nPersonally, I'm a fan of the Bakunin quote \"If there were a God, it would be necessary to overthrow Him.\" I think if I ever found out there truly was a God, I'd probably devote my life to figuring out how to find him and kill him. "}, {"id": "2m5qjh", "body": "Imagine you, Alex, and another man, Bob, sitting in a dark room. Bob suddenly exclaims, \"There's someone else in this room!\" Alarmed, you turn on your flashlight to look for this other man. You run about the room, trying to find him, but you cannot. You can't find the other man. You exclaim, \"What the hell are you talking about? I don't see anybody else!\" Bob just says, \"I know he's there. Just believe me!\"\n\nAfter going through the scenario above, why the hell would anybody be \"agnostic\" about the existence of a third man? As you search more and more vigorously and find no results, agnosticism quickly turns gnostic. The 3rd man doesn't exist. There's no reason to be \"unsure\" about this fact. \n\n\n\nThe same argument, IMO, can be applied to the nebulous concept known as \"God\". Sure, it's impossible to disprove the existence of God-like entities - concepts that share interesting features of God but are in no way, shape, or form any way related to the personal Gods (such as Allah or Yahweh) as believed by human society. Outside of philosophy, I don't see why anybody would be particularly interested in this form of God that has absolutely no practical consequence on humanity. What I'm interested in is the Gods that people actually believe in - the personal God that affects your daily life, that personally intervenes in your life to make it better, the one that's here to save your soul. \n\n\nI spent a good chunk of my life trying to find Yahweh or any other God. I couldn't find any sign of him whatsoever in this universe that we inhabit. And not only me, no scientist has found much of a trace of Him. Most Churches can't even find him either - instead, they must rely on Faith that He is there.\n\nIs it possible that \"personal Gods\" exist? Maybe. But as the search for that personal God continues, the probability that He exists diminishes to zero. How many times must I re-scan that dark room of Alex and Bob to ensure that the 3rd man does not exist? Every single lack of observation reaffirms the positive belief that \"No, the third man does not exist\", just like \"The Personal God does not exist\".\n\n\n\n\nWith new and updated observations of reality that continue to yield absolutely no evidence of God, the probability of the existence of God continues to diminish to zero. The discovery of classical mechanics proved that God wasn't needed to *actively* move heaven and Earth. The discovery of Evolution proved that God was not needed to actively create Life. Each new discovery reaffirms the fact that God does not intervene in the natural world using \"unnatural\" means. Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"mechanism that which drives the laws of nature\". Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"Universe\". But that sure is hell far, far away from the God of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and everyone else that believe in Gods. \n\nAtheism permits the possible existence of super-powerful, God-like creatures that may share many or even all of the features that are attributed to God. It's not unimaginable that an alien race has achieved such incredible powers to be even more powerful than the God as described in the Old Testament. These \"Gods\" may be so incredibly intelligent or powerful that they are unimaginable by human intelligence. But they're not supernatural. They're not the personal God believed by humanity that reincarnates you or whisks you off to heaven. I'm also sure you've heard of the simulation argument, that there is a \"super-universe\" on top of ours that controls us, much like how we play videogames that create \"sub-universes\" that we have near total control over. However, this version of God is in great contrast to the God imagined by most people. Most people don't believe that God is a supernatural Nerd playing his world's version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\". I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of gnostic atheists all can permit these kind of \"nearly supernatural\" beings to exist. Hell, why not describe Jesus Christ as a space alien that decided to land on Earth to fuck with the natives? But even if Alien Jesus shares all the same attributes as the actual Jesus, for some reason, it's different. Alien Jesus loses that sort of \"supernatural mystery\" that is the crux of atheist antipathy towards religion. \n\n\n\nGnostic atheism is defensible. We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We've tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man. Alex is fucking sure the 3rd man simply is not there! \n\n\nHumanity always strives to learn more and more about the world they live in and the universe in general. Agnostics throw their hands in the air and say, \"We don't know!\" Gnostic atheists continue the search for God - and when each search yields no results, their belief is reaffirmed that God does not exist. You don't have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it's utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What's there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it's the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm only arguing about semantics here. But I'm tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \n\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God. They just decided either to believe or not to care. But IMO, any person that actively searches for God's existence will eventually become an atheist, because every time he looks, nothing is found. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
