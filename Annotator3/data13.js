I don't believe this is possible without dire consequences that outweigh whatever benefits may exist. There have been quite a few CMVs arguing AGAINST this particular view of mine, including one that was mistitled to make it look like he agreed with me.\n\nTo clarify, I'm not endorsing the status quo in terms of drug policy. I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance, I personally don't use marijuana but I believe it's ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco, much more harmful and addictive drugs, are legal. This CMV applies to crack, heroin, powder cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, etc. I'm opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think it\u2019s a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery.\n\nThe main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. I've heard a lot of vague arguments that we should \"tax and regulate\" these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want, but you\u2019ll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case.\n\nCurrently, there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users, and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get. This is DESPITE the fact that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful and addictive than marijuana. Sure, you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on it if you really want to, but the law does deter millions. Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college, knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the 7-11?\n\nI understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available, but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law, and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. \n\nAs for the libertarian argument that it's a state infringement upon rights, I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that, and the most simply-worded right isn't always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others\u2019 rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d but I don\u2019t see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This changes the power balance between the user and the dealer, meaning that an unsatisfied user can report the dealer but never feels animosity to the police officers who may help them in taking down a dodgy dealer. \n\nThis would mean that drugs would become a valid market, allowing normal market forces to change the makeup of the market from people who splice bug spray into weed to make it seem more potent to those who produce good quality, safe produce. \n\nI also think that some drugs should remain illegal like ice, crack, heroin, etc for the near future. I think legalising the less addictive drugs, regulating their production, and taxing their sale would reduce the number of users in total. This would allow the market to prepare for harder things by reducing the relation to crime. Maybe in ten or fifteen years the market would be ready to handle the sale or more potent and addictive drugs but for now it would cause too much collateral damage in the form of people seeking more money to pump into the addiction and turning to illegal means to get it.

Take someone who currently takes crack and find out why their life is so screwed that it is a good option for them, work on resolving those issues, make crack a bad option compared with other things, person stops taking crack. It is a pretty simple and proven system, again look at Portugal, they have made it a public health issue rather than a criminal issue, and it is working well for them. \n\nAlso, production, regulation, and sale by the government or a legitimate business takes out all the related crime. There is a lot of peripheral crime to drug activity, specifically in both the illegal production, transport, distribution, and sale and also in the actions of the addicts. Make the addicts able to get their shit at a reasonable price from a good, clean source, you can take care of that issue. Make the product available without the involvement of criminal organisations, and you drastically reduce the viability of those criminal organisations, reducing their ability to make a profit from selling drugs. The worst case is they would undercut the government, making the same product or similar for a lower price. The buyers could still report them as it would not be a crime to buy or use, and the sellers would be running against a very large risk for very little profit. The criminal enterprises would collapse and society would be better for it. "}, {"id": "2nhvh5", "body": "\"All drugs should be legal\" is a very popular view on reddit, or at least its proponents are very vocal here. I don't believe this is possible without dire consequences that outweigh whatever benefits may exist. There have been quite a few CMVs arguing AGAINST this particular view of mine, including one that was mistitled to make it look like he agreed with me.\n\nTo clarify, I'm not endorsing the status quo in terms of drug policy. I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance, I personally don't use marijuana but I believe it's ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco, much more harmful and addictive drugs, are legal. This CMV applies to crack, heroin, powder cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, etc. I'm opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think it\u2019s a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery.\n\nThe main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. I've heard a lot of vague arguments that we should \"tax and regulate\" these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want, but you\u2019ll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case.\n\nCurrently, there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users, and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get. This is DESPITE the fact that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful and addictive than marijuana. Sure, you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on it if you really want to, but the law does deter millions. Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college, knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the 7-11?\n\nI understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available, but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law, and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. \n\nAs for the libertarian argument that it's a state infringement upon rights, I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that, and the most simply-worded right isn't always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others\u2019 rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d but I don\u2019t see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Have you ever heard of the concept of \"punching up\"?\n\n&gt; Comedy is about taking down the bullies. Traditionally in a carnivalesque way, the lowly, marginalized people would get to have their say and ridicule those with power: The fool is King for a day. \u2026 The whole thing falls apart when comedians kick down, and attack the most vulnerable members of society. It\u2019s lazy and hack to use derogatory slurs instead of punch-lines, and not in the original spirit of comedy.\n\nThat was the best quote from a [post that collected a bunch of thoughts on the matter.](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2014/07/21/never-punch-down/) But it was a better summation of the idea than I could pull together right now.\n\nBut it's not about me being offended. Sure, I might be offended by some bullshit that an idiot says. But I can handle that at this point in my life. I've fought through the years of not being sure who I was, and I figured myself out.  But the general social condemnation of gay people made that a hell of a lot harder for me, and it contributed towards a pretty deep depression I went through for a few years. My boyfriend has a similar experience. In fact, there are [a number of studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_among_LGBT_youth) that find that gay and trans kids experience depression and commit suicide at much higher rates than the general population.\n\nA lot of that is caused by the [overt shit like this.](http://www.joemygod.blogspot.com/2014/11/guest-post-carl-siciliano.html) But that overtly evil behavior doesn't exist in a vacuum. Social mores can work to promote or inhibit that behavior. It would, in my opinion, be a much better world if parents who kick their gay kids out of the house are the subject of general social ridicule. They should be social pariahs, who nobody in the community wants anything to do with, because they did something so foul that it's almost downright evil. But when gay people are the butt of constant jokes and the object of common ridicule (and much worse), it just serves to promote and justify that kind of behavior.\n\nBut the [general social attitude still has a big impact on kids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_stress) who don't have to deal directly with abusive behavior. Kids who are like the one I was.

Feel free to continue commenting but, please make sure your post is unique enough to warrant its own comment."}]}
