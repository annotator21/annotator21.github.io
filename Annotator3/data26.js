It\u2019s the law. According to law, a man must register with Selective Service within 30 days of his 18th birthday. Selective Service will accept late registrations but not after a man has reached age 26. You may be denied benefits or a job if you have not registered.\n\n[On Their FAQ](https://www.sss.gov/QA.HTM#quest1)\n&gt;What is Selective Service registration?\nRegistration is a way our government keeps a list of names of men from which to draw in case of a national emergency requiring rapid expansion of our Armed Forces. By registering all young men, the Selective Service ensures that a future draft will be fair and equitable.\n\n*AND*\n&gt;What is the penalty for not registering?\nFailure to register is a violation of the Military Selective Service Act. Conviction for such a violation may result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000.\n_____\n\nTroops regularly visit America high schools, often with presentations and trinkets, all in the hopes of getting people to register and sign up for the Army. \n\nI think the whole thing is fundamentally wrong:\n\n* You're being sexist and singling out young men to take away to war, girls get off entirely\n* ~~You've got Troops coming into schools to try and recruit children, which preys on youthful naivety and that feeling of invincibility inherent to children~~\n* ~~You're promising these kids who are in high school worrying about their future that if you sign up for the Army they'll cover all your educational needs. Putting your body on the line is a *\"career investment\"*, so they advertise.~~\n* You're severely punishing anyone who defies this idea of being drafted into the military. It's a fundamental breach of our freedoms and rights, and is wrong.\n\n***EDIT: The struck out sections I've reconsidered as more of a personal moral dilemma than a direct knock against the draft and Selective Service. Those go back to a more fundamental belief that the military is wrong because of being a pacifist, so the focus of the CMV should really be on the merits of Selective Service in and of itself, and not the morals of using youth in this way.***\n\nThis system almost requires every man and boy in the country to commit themselves to military service, to joining a massively over funded part of our government which is effectively an organization of disciplined murderers. \n\nI feel that expressing my opinions with my vote, protest, and activism does more good than joining the military to lay down my life for a corrupt government. I will more than willingly die for my family, or die in the name of this country, but not for this nation, not for the aristocracy that runs it. If you want to lay down your life in this nation's unjustified wars, which the rest of the world condemns us constantly for, be my guest. You can die for your nation, I'd rather live for my country.\n_____\n\nI'd like to see someone present some kind of valid argument which proves that forcing a draft would be required and do good for the United States and the world in the context of modern military conflicts; that it is more valuable than freedom and individual choice; that the punishment is in any way equal to the \"crime\" of not wanting to join armed forces and become an accessory to legalized murder; that this country needs such large armed forces for defense in a draft, since foreign troops haven't been on our soils since we defeated the British in the Revolution and War of 1812; and that these things are objectively required for a free society outside of some slippery slope or otherwise overtly patriotic nonsense. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "cm9po85", "body": "&gt;nor were any of our close allies. \n\nActually, France, a NATO ally, was under not only threat, but involved in open hostilities.  Much of the reason we got drawn into Vietnam was due to our treaties with France.  Additionally, the spread of communism was viewed as a direct threat to the US and Vietnam was one of the most visible expansions of communism in the world in the 50s and 60s.  (You may not agree that it was a threat, but that was what was believed at the time.)\n\nI'm not familiar with the Militia Act of 1903, so I can't comment on it directly.  However, the idea of relying on an unorganized militia as the sole means of defending the nation from attack is not reasonable, because an untrained, heavily armed force can almost always be beaten by a well trained, smaller force.  One of the chief problems that Washington faced in the opening years of the revolution was the incompetence of continental soldiers when faced with trained British regulars.  It wasn't until he was able to institute a regular course of drill and discipline that he was able to effectively employ the Continental Army to defeat the British in direct battles.  Add to that, the fact that there would be no defined hierarchy, organization, or distribution of duties, and you have a recipe for military failure.  I will say that I personally believe if the US were invaded, there are plenty of people who would significantly harass the enemy using partisan tactics.  But partisan attacks and sabotage are delaying actions.  They can't achieve victory on their own.\n\nThere are two separate philosophical question that are being discussed and I think it's important to separate them.  (1) Does a citizen or subject of a nation have a responsibility to fight in the armed services in defense of the country in a just war?  (2) Who decides whether or not a war is just or that military action is justified?\n\nIn answer to the first, I would argue that a citizen has the responsibility, when called upon, to defend the nation which has granted to one the rights and liberties which one has enjoyed and which one would like to continue to enjoy.  The USA is unique in that its government is one of the first founded on the principal that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.  If that is the case, then the government must also rely upon the governed to defend it when necessary.\n\nIn answer to the second, it would be nice if every military action were clearly right or wrong and we could all agree.  The problem is that we don't and, unfortunately, military action requires agreement in acts, if not agreement in sentiment.  The US has provided a solution by empowering a few elected officials to make the decision.  You may not agree with the decision that has been made, but those persons have that authority to make that decision on your behalf.  If you allow one to be excepted from military service because of a political opinion, then you have no ability to draft and are totally reliant upon a volunteer force.  We have been fortunate in the last 35-40 years to be able to establish such a force; but it is not realistic to expect an all volunteer force can serve in all cases."}, {"id": "2mzpa0", "body": "For those who don't know about the Selective Service Act in the United States; [here's a quote from SSS.gov](https://www.sss.gov/default.htm)\n&gt;If you are a man ages 18 through 25 and living in the U.S., then you must register with Selective Service.

It's a fundamental breach of our freedoms and rights, and is wrong.\n\n***EDIT: The struck out sections I've reconsidered as more of a personal moral dilemma than a direct knock against the draft and Selective Service. Those go back to a more fundamental belief that the military is wrong because of being a pacifist, so the focus of the CMV should really be on the merits of Selective Service in and of itself, and not the morals of using youth in this way.***\n\nThis system almost requires every man and boy in the country to commit themselves to military service, to joining a massively over funded part of our government which is effectively an organization of disciplined murderers. \n\nI feel that expressing my opinions with my vote, protest, and activism does more good than joining the military to lay down my life for a corrupt government. I will more than willingly die for my family, or die in the name of this country, but not for this nation, not for the aristocracy that runs it. If you want to lay down your life in this nation's unjustified wars, which the rest of the world condemns us constantly for, be my guest. You can die for your nation, I'd rather live for my country.\n_____\n\nI'd like to see someone present some kind of valid argument which proves that forcing a draft would be required and do good for the United States and the world in the context of modern military conflicts; that it is more valuable than freedom and individual choice; that the punishment is in any way equal to the \"crime\" of not wanting to join armed forces and become an accessory to legalized murder; that this country needs such large armed forces for defense in a draft, since foreign troops haven't been on our soils since we defeated the British in the Revolution and War of 1812; and that these things are objectively required for a free society outside of some slippery slope or otherwise overtly patriotic nonsense. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Unless you can demonstrate that conscription was immoral for those instances, then you've only shown the potential for it to be misused and not that it's immoral.\n\nWhen examining the morality of Selective Service, we first have to place it in context; the fact that something was moral or justified in the past does not necessarily mean it's justified now.  In order to do that, we have to set aside how it's been used in the past and look at how it will most likely be used in the future.  Because the war in Vietnam is the most *proximate* to the present case, both in time (by a good three decades) and format, it dominates that analysis over cases from one, two, or three generations prior.\n\nRegardless, I was mostly just trying to point out that since the Vietnam-era draft was unnecessary and (in both of our views) illegitimate, it cannot be counted when looking at how long it's been since the draft has been *needed*.

I agree that it's a stretch to call 69 years a century, but 39 is the wrong figure for this discussion.\n\n&gt;And that's my entire point.

In the U.S. Constitutional context, this would be analogous to \"strict scrutiny,\" which requires that the relevant law or policy be \"narrowly tailored\" to the government interest and the \"least restrictive means\" for achieving that interest.  Given that the legitimate government interest is the protection of national sovereignty and the safety of the populace, a Selective Service system that allows people to be drafted during conflicts that do not plausibly threaten the sovereignty or populace of the U.S. clearly cannot pass such a review.

It\u2019s the law. According to law, a man must register with Selective Service within 30 days of his 18th birthday. Selective Service will accept late registrations but not after a man has reached age 26. You may be denied benefits or a job if you have not registered.\n\n[On Their FAQ](https://www.sss.gov/QA.HTM#quest1)\n&gt;What is Selective Service registration?\nRegistration is a way our government keeps a list of names of men from which to draw in case of a national emergency requiring rapid expansion of our Armed Forces. By registering all young men, the Selective Service ensures that a future draft will be fair and equitable.\n\n*AND*\n&gt;What is the penalty for not registering?\nFailure to register is a violation of the Military Selective Service Act. Conviction for such a violation may result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000.\n_____\n\nTroops regularly visit America high schools, often with presentations and trinkets, all in the hopes of getting people to register and sign up for the Army. \n\nI think the whole thing is fundamentally wrong:\n\n* You're being sexist and singling out young men to take away to war, girls get off entirely\n* ~~You've got Troops coming into schools to try and recruit children, which preys on youthful naivety and that feeling of invincibility inherent to children~~\n* ~~You're promising these kids who are in high school worrying about their future that if you sign up for the Army they'll cover all your educational needs. Putting your body on the line is a *\"career investment\"*, so they advertise.~~\n* You're severely punishing anyone who defies this idea of being drafted into the military. It's a fundamental breach of our freedoms and rights, and is wrong.\n\n***EDIT: The struck out sections I've reconsidered as more of a personal moral dilemma than a direct knock against the draft and Selective Service. Those go back to a more fundamental belief that the military is wrong because of being a pacifist, so the focus of the CMV should really be on the merits of Selective Service in and of itself, and not the morals of using youth in this way.***\n\nThis system almost requires every man and boy in the country to commit themselves to military service, to joining a massively over funded part of our government which is effectively an organization of disciplined murderers. \n\nI feel that expressing my opinions with my vote, protest, and activism does more good than joining the military to lay down my life for a corrupt government. I will more than willingly die for my family, or die in the name of this country, but not for this nation, not for the aristocracy that runs it. If you want to lay down your life in this nation's unjustified wars, which the rest of the world condemns us constantly for, be my guest. You can die for your nation, I'd rather live for my country.\n_____\n\nI'd like to see someone present some kind of valid argument which proves that forcing a draft would be required and do good for the United States and the world in the context of modern military conflicts; that it is more valuable than freedom and individual choice; that the punishment is in any way equal to the \"crime\" of not wanting to join armed forces and become an accessory to legalized murder; that this country needs such large armed forces for defense in a draft, since foreign troops haven't been on our soils since we defeated the British in the Revolution and War of 1812; and that these things are objectively required for a free society outside of some slippery slope or otherwise overtly patriotic nonsense. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It\u2019s the law. According to law, a man must register with Selective Service within 30 days of his 18th birthday.

You may be denied benefits or a job if you have not registered.\n\n[On Their FAQ](https://www.sss.gov/QA.HTM#quest1)\n&gt;What is Selective Service registration?\nRegistration is a way our government keeps a list of names of men from which to draw in case of a national emergency requiring rapid expansion of our Armed Forces. By registering all young men, the Selective Service ensures that a future draft will be fair and equitable.\n\n*AND*\n&gt;What is the penalty for not registering?\nFailure to register is a violation of the Military Selective Service Act.

Spanish colonialism was through viceroyalty, an extension of the kingdom, and with a kind of aristocracy flavor.  There was no Homestead Act where the government gifted land to anyone willing to work for it.  Instead, massive tracts of lands were endowed by the kingdom or viceroyalty to relatively few people, and those people developed it.  Even now, its something like 95% of the land is controlled by 10% of the people.  In the agricultural intensive central american countries, this means that a relatively small upper class controls the vast majority of the wealth, while the majority are poor farmers and plantation hands that just survive.  This makes democracy virtually impossible, as the demands of the many poor is basically incompatible with the interests of the powerful few.  The poltical systems have been skewed based on the needs of the oligarchs.  Since the wealth disparity is so great, it can't be achieved through popular opinion, it is achieved through corruption: bribing officials and greasing wheels to make conditions favorable to you.

Just like there will always be a place in our hearts for a plot hole-ridden classic film like \"Wizard of Oz\", so too will Peanuts always hold a place as an iconic staple in the comic lover's heart. \n\nBut the comic itself is not worthy of such high praise when viewed on its merits:\n\n1. The actual art style of the comic is usually very repetitive and plain. Most of the art consists of the characters talking to each other in front of sparse backgrounds such as walking, the pitching mound, Lucy's psychiatric stand, or the pumpkin patch. Rarely do the animations depict any interesting action, and they are usually interchangeable between days. \n\n2. The comic's comedy or sentimental value is also objectively low. Rarely is a strip something that elicits even a smile, let alone some sort of profound emotion. Instead we read to see beloved characters acting out some one-note plot over four frames. \n\n3. Most of the most beloved parts of \"Peanuts\" are actually from the animated TV specials such as the \"wa-wa\" sound of the teacher, the distinctive Peanuts theme song, and the dancing scenes with the characters. These elements don't exist in the realm of the comic, making the TV specials arguably more important to American pop culture than the comic itself. \n\nThose are my primary arguments but I'm open to change so CMV!

One of the things we look for most in any art is something to identify with, something that strikes a chord for us, personally.\n\nCharlie Brown is the perfect everyman.  He laughs, he jokes, he has fun, he has his mild successes, but most of all, he has his failures, his inadequacies.  He's not cartoonishly depressed like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh.  He's exactly as is a common part of the human experience.  But most of us continue to pick ourselves up and go again, just hoping to do a little better this time.  Most of the time we fail.  But we try to keep our hopes up.  Give ourselves a little pep talk and go on.\n\nHe's not a caricature of humanity.  He's a candid photograph of it.\n\nThen we have Snoopy, the happy-go-lucky, cool, smart, joyful one that all of us wish we were.\n\nLinus worries.\n\nLucy is angry.\n\nSchrodinger's a geek.\n\nThen we have many more supporting characters who fill in the gaps and provide people to tell stories with.\n\nBut ultimately, it's about how it plays with our humanity.  Every damn one of us is Charlie Brown with the football about something in our lives, and by following the strip, you relate more and more.  It's not something that can win any contests in one strip alone.  It's like Professor Higgins said: \"I've grown accustomed to her face\".\n\nIt's a friend who understands, REALLY understands.\n\nEach of the characters is used to play a little joke on some little quirk about some aspect of humanity.  But there's a reason that Charlie Brown is the main character, with Snoopy close behind.

If I started hearing them from early May to mid June, the positive effect would wear thin. The songs would be less satisfying just because I've been desensitized.\n\nHere's my take on the OPs view: It's all about the invasiveness of the christmas celebration, the relative infiltration those celebrations (which are not my own) have in my everyday life.\n\nWith christmas, you have a whole slew of decorations, events, TV content, and songs being so prevalent. Generally speaking, people strongly connect to those things as being a positive part of the whole christmas experience. They see the dilution of that experience (by extending the duration) as having a negative effect on that experience.\n\nI think it's worth clarifying that people generally don't care whether someone is personally celebrating christmas earlier than them. It's the relative obnoxiousness of most christmas celebrations that makes it so invasive (obnoxiousness is part of the charm imo). It can't be avoided in most cases and on a larger scale you can't helped but get bombarded with christmas \"stuff\" whether you are ready for it or not.\n\nFor example, I doubt anyone cares if someone plays christmas music in their car all year long. They do care, however, that every store they enter plays it constantly during a time when they prefer not to hear it (diluting their personal experience)."}, {"id": "cm95m0z", "body": "&gt; There are only like 8 Christmas songs\n\n\nSanta Claus is Coming to Town\n\nWhite Christmas\n\nGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen (don't judge until you've heard The Bare Naked Ladies cover)\n\nIt's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\n\nThe Christmas Song (\"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire\" etc)\n\nI'll Be Home for Christmas\n\nLast Christmas\n\nAll I Want for Christmas Is You\n\nI Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\n\nSanta Baby\n\nHappy Holidays\n\nO Holy Night\n\nCarol of the Bells\n\nHere Comes Santa Claus\n\nLittle Drummer Boy\n\nHome for the Holidays\n\nHappy Christmas (War Is Over)\n\nFrosty the Snowman\n\nLittle Saint Nick\n\nIt's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\n\nDo You Hear What I Hear\n\nBlue Christmas\n\nSilent Night\n\nWhat Christmas Means to Me\n\nSilver Bells\n\nHere Comes Santa Claus\n\nSleigh Ride\n\nWinter Wonderland\n\nRudolph the Rednosed Reindeer\n\nJingle Bell Rock\n\nRockin' Around the Christmas Tree\n\nLet It Snow (Technically not specific to Christmas, but adopted as \"Christmas music\")\n\nBaby It's Cold Outside\n\nWhere Are You Christmas (Faith Hill, yo)\n\nGrandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBroaden your horizons."}, {"id": "cm9bamm", "body": "Oh shit guys, he knows some christmas music.

What is the first day where it is acceptable? Is it the day after Halloween?

Having Christmas start the day after Halloween would give you 2 months of Christmas, which for most would be just to much and at the start of that time would even be the wrong season (still fall and not winter weather wise). Picking an arbitrary date in the middle of November is just weird. \n\nAnd honestly shouldn't Thanksgiving get some of its own time to shine? The spirit of Thanksgiving centered around the harvest and being thankful for what we have is different from Christmas and its spirit of giving (ignoring religious aspects here, but those come into play to).

This, for the Christian Church is a season of preparation and anticipation.  \n\nThe season of Christmas is then an additional 12 days beginning on Christmas day and continuing to January 6 which is another special day known as 'Epiphany'.\n\nWhether or not you celebrate Christmas for those same reasons, I think that if we can agree that Christmas has as its modern day foundation, a particular event in the Church calendar (the birth of Christ) - it makes sense to begin the \"Christmas season\" at a time that is consistent with that same calendar.  That time would be the beginning of the Advent season.

After your first impression of a song, you tend to like it more as you hear it more\u2014it's a kind of mere-exposure effect.

If you continue to hear it repeatedly after that point, it can start to provoke a negative reaction. First it starts to get annoying; taken to extremes, it is a highly dysphoric and, as I mentioned, is used as a psychological torture technique.\n\nThis is why pop music tends to have a short shelf life. It's heavily played on the radio for a a matter of months, gets increasingly popular as people are repeatedly exposed to it, then is removed quite quickly as it starts to annoy people. Christmas music accelerates this lifecycle because people hear more of it. In January through November, even if you're walking through a mall, you'll hear a variety of background music\u2014different shops will choose different genres or stations of music so you won't hear the same songs *as often*. Then, during the Christmas season, places that don't normally play music at all start playing the same music as well. So suddenly, people are hearing a small selections of songs much more often, and reaching those psychological thresholds (first, of pleasure, then boredom, annoyance, and dysphoria) much faster.\n\nSo when I say 1/4 people find Christmas music annoying, it's not quite that simple. It's not like out of every four people, one of them will always be annoyed by Christmas music no matter and what and the other three are stoked to listen to *Little Drummer Boy* on repeat for a week solid. If more Christmas music is played, more people will get sick of it. If places start playing Christmas music earlier, people will get sick of it earlier, and then they'll get even *more* annoyed and frustrated by it later on.\n\nThere are people who are happy to hear Christmas music from December 1 to 26th because that's not long enough to become annoying to them, but who\u2014if everyone starts playing it a couple weeks earlier\u2014will be sick of it by Christmas Day. And if two months is comfortably within your personal threshold, I'm guessing you're not working in retail where you have to listen to it for 8+ hours a day, non-stop.

Perhaps \"black\" to the kind of people that run these snooty shops is an indication of \"poor\". Perhaps if a poor-looking white person came in they would get exactly the same treatment. That seems to be confirmed by the fact that when they later learned who she was they offered to give her free stuff.\n\nSo once again, the \"race\" issue resolves itself into a class issue, a money issue.
