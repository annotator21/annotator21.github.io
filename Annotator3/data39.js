Roundup ready crops often lead to overuse of glyphosate, indiscriminate use of GMO plants can lead to resistant bugs/weeds, the herbicides/pesticides associated with GMO crops can kill beneficial organisms, and transfer of GMO genes from domestic crops to wild plants may have unforeseen ecological consequences.\n\nNow obviously GMO crops have huge benefits, and any negative side effects are still relatively unknown, so I don't think this is enough to call Monsanto evil, but it may be true that they've acted a bit irresponsibly?\n\nFinally, Monsanto gets a bad rap due to their lawsuits. As determined by the courts, Monsanto has a legal right to protect their patent (which is controversial in and of itself), and most of their cases are sound, but as always their mistakes always get the most attention.

Roundup ready crops often lead to overuse of glyphosate, indiscriminate use of GMO plants can lead to resistant bugs/weeds, the herbicides/pesticides associated with GMO crops can kill beneficial organisms, and transfer of GMO genes from domestic crops to wild plants may have unforeseen ecological consequences.\n\nNow obviously GMO crops have huge benefits, and any negative side effects are still relatively unknown, so I don't think this is enough to call Monsanto evil, but it may be true that they've acted a bit irresponsibly?\n\nFinally, Monsanto gets a bad rap due to their lawsuits. As determined by the courts, Monsanto has a legal right to protect their patent (which is controversial in and of itself), and most of their cases are sound, but as always their mistakes always get the most attention.

As determined by the courts, Monsanto has a legal right to protect their patent (which is controversial in and of itself), and most of their cases are sound, but as always their mistakes always get the most attention. If one were to only hear about all the mistaken legal action performed by Monsanto, then it wouldn't be much of a stretch to portray them as waging a war against innocent farmers.\n\nA complicating factor for the previous paragraph is that there are few to no unbiased sources. Obviously Monsanto denies any wrongdoing, while I'm guessing that the persecuted farmers' reports claims of innocence and victimization by the company are somewhat exaggerated.\n\nEdit: Because for some reason this is a huge issue.

Shouldn't the company that spent millions researching and developing the seeds have the distribution rights?\n\nYour analogy is flawed. You cannot infinitely and flawlessly copy a seed. Each seed becomes one thing: a plant. That plant may bear fruit, but to do so it requires soil, sunlight, rain, and food. \n\nFurthermore, if I buy a seed, do I not have a right to the crop itself? Are not the seeds part of the crop? If Monsanto has a right to the seed, it has a right to the whole crop and the whole concept falls down, because why would I bother buying a seed from them in the first place? \n\nFurther furthermore, it doesn't matter how much Monsanto spends on research, they don't deserve anything just for spending money on research. It is not society's job to make sure Monsanto has a way to make money, it's Monsanto's job to make sure it can make money. If they can spend money on research and can make more money with that research than they could have had they done the research, good on them.

The seeds can be reproduced in mass at a much lower cost but the prices are elevated so that the company who made the seeds can make a profit.\n\nUpfront costs may justify high prices, but if a company cannot turn a profit after those upfront costs, why should it remain in business? \n\n&gt; My point is there is no reason to make large investments in R and D if those investments yield no returns. ... By removing patents from this industry you would be removing innovation. \n\nYou keep making these statements contrary to all observable evidence. Just because there is no patent doesn't mean that there will be no yield on return for research. \n\n&gt;Instead of developing new seeds companies will simply sell the same seeds. Instead of the business being about R and D it will be about production.\n\n... so? That's a risk of research. Are you saying that all business should be viable without any risk whatsoever? Risk is a part of business. Hell, patents themselves only last for a couple decades, but the vast majority (across the entire concepts of patents) are only market viable for a couple years as people do the same thing in a different way. Which was the point of patents. But the truth is that first to market is the *only* thing that matters when it comes to innovation, and the market moves way faster than it used to when the idea of patents came up. \n\nThe idea behind patents was that by declaring exactly how something was made, you were granted the exclusive right to make that thing for 20 years, after which anyone could make that thing exactly the same way if they wanted. \n\nThe idea was that in order to do the same thing as a competitor, you had to do something *different* from the existing patent. You had to innovate, you had to seek an alternative solution to the problem. It's somewhat counter-intuitive: monopolies inevitably lead to stagnation, yet patents grant a monopoly, albeit temporarily. On the face of it, patents should lead to stagnation because once you have a patent you don't have to innovate anymore. Patents worked, however because that monopoly was temporary, and because patents were, historically interpreted narrowly. \n\nHowever, that has changed over time, and patents these days are interpreted so broadly that it's possible to patent the concept of a thing rather than the thing itself. Or, to put it another way, it's possible to patent all solutions to a problem rather than a single solution to that problem. Historically, patents were intended for a single solution rather than all solutions, but these days we get patents for [the idea of giving a gift on Facebook](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=facebook.ASNM.&amp;OS=AN/facebook&amp;RS=AN/facebook).\n\nBut Monsanto and big pharma go even further. They're not patenting a solution to a problem. They're even not patenting all solutions to a problem. They're patenting existence. It's like giving somebody a patent on iron. Not on a new forge that heats up iron to higher temperatures using less fuel, it's like patenting the chemical formula for iron itself. Everyone who uses iron must pay a licensing fee. \n\nThat's what Monsanto and the drug companies are doing. They're patenting the DNA for the plant, rather than patenting a machine that will let you grow better seed plants. \n\nAnd I reject that entirely. It violates the historical ideals of patents, and is generally bad for society. It shouldn't be allowed, but of course they paid off the right people and here we are. \n\n*edit* fixed poor wording and the like. "}, {"id": "cm5fymf", "body": "&gt; Here is the issue with your logic. You aren't selling seeds you bought from Monsanto. Instead you are producing your own seeds from the seeds you bought (growing the crop and harvesting seeds from it).\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I totally misread what you wrote. I thought you meant buying and re-selling seeds. Totally my bad.\n\n&gt; It is actually much more akin to software or digital media. It reproduces and its offspring are the same as the initial product. You could start a company where you simply buy a small batch of Monsanto seeds and the reproduce them and sell them in mass. Shouldn't the company that spent millions researching and developing the seeds have the distribution rights?\n\nYour analogy is flawed. You cannot infinitely and flawlessly copy a seed. Each seed becomes one thing: a plant. That plant may bear fruit, but to do so it requires soil, sunlight, rain, and food. \n\nFurthermore, if I buy a seed, do I not have a right to the crop itself? Are not the seeds part of the crop? If Monsanto has a right to the seed, it has a right to the whole crop and the whole concept falls down, because why would I bother buying a seed from them in the first place? \n\nFurther furthermore, it doesn't matter how much Monsanto spends on research, they don't deserve anything just for spending money on research. It is not society's job to make sure Monsanto has a way to make money, it's Monsanto's job to make sure it can make money. If they can spend money on research and can make more money with that research than they could have had they done the research, good on them. But they shouldn't get guaranteed money just for doing research. They need to *earn* their money, just like all the rest of us. \n\n&gt;Why not? The cost on these seeds are not in the production phase. The costs are upfront development costs (very similar to software). The seeds can be reproduced in mass at a much lower cost but the prices are elevated so that the company who made the seeds can make a profit.\n\nUpfront costs may justify high prices, but if a company cannot turn a profit after those upfront costs, why should it remain in business? \n\n&gt; My point is there is no reason to make large investments in R and D if those investments yield no returns. ... By removing patents from this industry you would be removing innovation. \n\nYou keep making these statements contrary to all observable evidence. Just because there is no patent doesn't mean that there will be no yield on return for research. \n\n&gt;Instead of developing new seeds companies will simply sell the same seeds. Instead of the business being about R and D it will be about production.\n\n... so? That's a risk of research. Are you saying that all business should be viable without any risk whatsoever? Risk is a part of business. Hell, patents themselves only last for a couple decades, but the vast majority (across the entire concepts of patents) are only market viable for a couple years as people do the same thing in a different way. Which was the point of patents. But the truth is that first to market is the *only* thing that matters when it comes to innovation, and the market moves way faster than it used to when the idea of patents came up. \n\nThe idea behind patents was that by declaring exactly how something was made, you were granted the exclusive right to make that thing for 20 years, after which anyone could make that thing exactly the same way if they wanted. \n\nThe idea was that in order to do the same thing as a competitor, you had to do something *different* from the existing patent. You had to innovate, you had to seek an alternative solution to the problem. It's somewhat counter-intuitive: monopolies inevitably lead to stagnation, yet patents grant a monopoly, albeit temporarily. On the face of it, patents should lead to stagnation because once you have a patent you don't have to innovate anymore. Patents worked, however because that monopoly was temporary, and because patents were, historically interpreted narrowly. \n\nHowever, that has changed over time, and patents these days are interpreted so broadly that it's possible to patent the concept of a thing rather than the thing itself.

You cannot infinitely and flawlessly copy a seed. Each seed becomes one thing: a plant. That plant may bear fruit, but to do so it requires soil, sunlight, rain, and food.\n\nFirst off: You can endlessly produce seeds at an extremely low cost. Second: Compare the costs to endlessly producing seeds to the costs of r and d to produce the first seed. There is no reason to produce a new seed unless you can sell it for a higher price. If there is an endless and cheap supply of the seed it will not be worth much regardless of how good it is. You aren't paying Monsanto for the physical seed. You are paying them for the intellectual property that is the seed's genome. This is what costs the most money.\n\n&gt;Upfront costs may justify high prices, but if a company cannot turn a profit after those upfront costs, why should it remain in business?\n\nThe free market does not work for everything. It doesn't work for digital media and it doesn't work for software. This is because what you are selling is intelectual property. In this world distribution rights are paramount for any return on investment to be seen. I work in software. Imagine if my company released the software for a price but were fine with people copying it and re-distributing it. We would have a single sale. How could they pay my salary and the salaries of the other developers?\n\n&gt;You keep making these statements contrary to all observable evidence. Just because there is no patent doesn't mean that there will be no yield on return for research.\n\nI keep making these statements after I have backed them up with solid arguments. I have pointed out that seeds can be reproduced very cheaply and unless you artificially inflate the price it is impossible to see a return on your investment.\n\n&gt;The idea was that in order to do the same thing as a competitor, you had to do something different from the existing patent. You had to innovate, you have to seek an alternative solution to the problem.\n\nWhich is exactly what it does in the seed industry. We continually see new GMOs that are better than the last. With less regulation and more public trust we could see some really amazing products which have the potential to revolutionize food production.\n\n&gt;However, that has changed over time, and patents these days are interpreted so broadly that it's possible to patent the concept of a thing rather than the thing itself. Or, to put it another way, it's possible to patent all solutions to a problem rather than a single solution to that problem. Historically, patents were intended for a single solution rather than all solutions, but these days we get patents for the idea of giving a gift on Facebook.\n\nI am not trying to validate all patents here. There is no need to beat a strawman. All I am saying is that distribution rights are incredibly important for seed companies just as they are for software companies.\n\n&gt;They're patenting the DNA for the plant, rather than patenting a machine that will let you grow better seed plants.\n\nAs they should. Software isn't physical yet it is still valuable and important. Intellectual property is harder to conceptualize than physical machinery but it is still very important.\n\nAll in all I think you are just stuck in the physical world. You can't decide to remove patents for seed companies just because of a philosophical belief that patents should stay in the physical world. You have to think practically and think about what would happen if you removed all distribution rights from companies which sell intellectual property.

Monsanto, among other things, aided in the creation of Agent Orange (which contributed to the deaths of thousands, and still contributes to birth defects in southeast asia), sues small-scale farmers for trivial instances of seed saving, and were a major player in the rash of Indian farmer suicides in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nPart of Monsanto's business strategy is that, in countries that allow companies to own genetic patents, Monsanto will sell GMO seeds to farmers, the farmers will grow the crop, and at the end of the cycle, must return the seed to Monsanto, as the patent defines the crop as property of Monsanto. This doesn't seem so bad on the surface, after all, farmers are all opting into this program, aren't they?\n\nWell, it turns out they aren't. In many places, Monsanto has monopoly power over seed distribution of varying crops, which not only pressures farmers to buy their seeds, but effectively gives them no other option. This means that farmers are essentially required to play by Monsanto's rules, and feed into their profits, instead of guarantee their own well-being.\n\nThe result over time has been increasing economic hardship for farmers in Monsanto monopoly areas. In a normal model, farmers would simply save their seeds from the previous crop and plant them again the next year, effectively reducing the costs of seeds to near-zero (as they are self-replenishing). Under Monsanto, however, they have to return the seeds to Monsanto, and then buy them back again for the next harvest cycle, meaning that they incur costs for seeds year after year. One bad crop can spell disaster for a farmer under this system: not only do they not have a crop to sell, but they're now on the hook for a bunch of Monsanto property, and have to pay money again to do it all over again the next year.\n\nThe result in different areas has varied, the most extreme being the [Farmer Suicides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto#Farmer_suicides) in India.

Monsanto, among other things, aided in the creation of Agent Orange (which contributed to the deaths of thousands, and still contributes to birth defects in southeast asia), sues small-scale farmers for trivial instances of seed saving, and were a major player in the rash of Indian farmer suicides in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nPart of Monsanto's business strategy is that, in countries that allow companies to own genetic patents, Monsanto will sell GMO seeds to farmers, the farmers will grow the crop, and at the end of the cycle, must return the seed to Monsanto, as the patent defines the crop as property of Monsanto. This doesn't seem so bad on the surface, after all, farmers are all opting into this program, aren't they?\n\nWell, it turns out they aren't. In many places, Monsanto has monopoly power over seed distribution of varying crops, which not only pressures farmers to buy their seeds, but effectively gives them no other option. This means that farmers are essentially required to play by Monsanto's rules, and feed into their profits, instead of guarantee their own well-being.\n\nThe result over time has been increasing economic hardship for farmers in Monsanto monopoly areas. In a normal model, farmers would simply save their seeds from the previous crop and plant them again the next year, effectively reducing the costs of seeds to near-zero (as they are self-replenishing). Under Monsanto, however, they have to return the seeds to Monsanto, and then buy them back again for the next harvest cycle, meaning that they incur costs for seeds year after year. One bad crop can spell disaster for a farmer under this system: not only do they not have a crop to sell, but they're now on the hook for a bunch of Monsanto property, and have to pay money again to do it all over again the next year.\n\nThe result in different areas has varied, the most extreme being the [Farmer Suicides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto#Farmer_suicides) in India. Monsanto, which owned as much as 95% of the supply of cotton seeds in Maharashtra, would hold farmers responsible for their debts at a time where interest rates were rising rapidly and crops were turning out poor. The result was thousands of farmers committing suicides to escape their desperate economic situations. While Monsanto wasn't the only culprit, they were the focus of several investigations into the increase in suicides in the 1990s and early 2000s (emphasis is mine):\n\n&gt; Critics, including Vandana Shiva, said that the crop failures could \"often be traced to\" Monsanto's Bt cotton, and that the seeds increased farmers' indebtedness, and argued that Monsanto misrepresented the profitability of their genetically modified cotton, Bt Cotton, causing farmers to suffer losses leading to debt. In 2009, Dr. Shiva wrote that **Indian farmers who had previously spent as little as \u20b97 (rupees) per kilogram were now paying up to \u20b917,000 per kilo per year after switching to Bt cotton**. More recently, in 2012 the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Central Cotton Research Institute (CCRI) stated that **for the first time farmer suicides could be linked to a decline in the performance of Bt cotton**, and they issued an advisory stating that \u201ccotton farmers are in a deep crisis since shifting to Bt cotton. The spate of farmer suicides in 2011-12 has been particularly severe among Bt cotton farmers.\u201d\n\n**TL:DR**: It's not just a matter of what it is they're producing or how charitable and friendly they seem on the surface, but how they conduct business, and how they utilize patent law and their regional monopoly powers to undermine the economic well-being of farmers for the sake of profits."}, {"id": "cm4k8gs", "body": "&gt;and at the end of the cycle, must return the seed to Monsanto, \n\nYou don't understand farming, do you?

It explains in detail exactly how they altered the crop DNA to make it better, so that's no secret. The patent allows them to prosecute anyone who purposefully plants the seed without paying the royalty, or anyone who tries to produce their own before the patent expires.\n\n* The contract with the farmer. This is what you're referring to. In the contract the farmer agrees not to replant, propagate the crop or otherwise violate the IP. As I explained above, it would be impractical to give the seed back to Monsanto. The contract not only outlines the agreement of how seed can be used, but it also helps the company track who should and shouldn't be growing their cultivars. If you have a good reason to think a farmer is growing your cultivars without paying for them, you can get a warrant to do DNA testing on their plants. \n\nSurely there are hundreds of farms that do it anyways, but it's very difficult and expensive to catch them.

They took one of the few insecticides that is safe and non-persistent enough to be available for use on organic farms and essentially bathed pests in the stuff, ensuring its rapid obsolescence. Bt sprays have been used for pest control since the 1920s, but I'm aware of only one pest species (the diamondback moth) that developed resistance to Bt prior to the introduction of Bt crops in 1996. Now there are [at least 5 resistant species](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n6/full/nbt.2597.html). Yes, they achieved a short-term decrease in insecticide use, but it is now [climbing again](http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323463704578496923254944066).\n\nGlyphosate resistant crops are a slight improvement, because they have encouraged the widespread adoption of no-till farming techniques, which reduce carbon emissions. However, glyphosate resistance is also a huge and growing problem, which is forcing many farmers to return to mechanical tilling and/or increase their use of other herbicides, so again, the benefits are likely temporary at best.\n\nIn short, I fail to see how either of these products have produced more than short-term benefits, and in the process, they've greatly accelerated the development of resistance to a pair of comparatively mild and eco-friendly pesticides, which ultimately damages our future food security. With climate change coming down the pipeline (encouraging the spread of pests and weeds to regions that were previously inhospitable to them), we can't afford to be so cavalier about trashing useful tools in pursuit of short-term profit. Monsanto is far from the only offender in this regard, but it has, to date, been by far the most successful in terms of market share.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the fact that the overwhelming majority of the Bt and glyphosate-resistant crops in question are corn and soy. Soy has some redeeming value thanks to being a nitrogen fixer, but corn's primary products are low quality meats, low quality fuels, and low quality sugars. Hellooooo obesity and climate crises.

There are many rumors and misinformation, but nothing that supports their status as an \"evil\" or \"bad\" company.\n\nEvil is a moral judgment. You're not going to find research that proves they're \"evil\".\n\nAre you aware in previous decades they were known for [DDT and Agent Orange]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto).

I'm sure the Taliban spent money improving their bombs.\n\nThere are some serious questions about the safety of their current products.  One of their best known current products is probably Roundup (glyphosate) and the accompanying Round Up Ready GMOS crops.   They claim glyphosate can't hurt people because it relies on an enzyme pathway only found in plants.  They didn't do safety testing in mammals.  Now scientists are finding glyphosate [isn't breaking down quickly in the environment the way they said it would  and it's affecting lower life forms]( http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/programs/health-environment/pesticides/glyphosate-fact-sheet.shtml).  Roundup turns out to be toxic to people after all ([toxicity on Wikipedia page]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate).  Farmers have died from it.\n\nWhat do I consider evil?    It's using their power to influence legislation to allow for the release of open pollinated GMO crops. Open pollinated means the genetics from one field cab blow and end up in a conventional crop field.   Not only do they take no responsibility for when their genes contaminate farmers who don't want GMO crops, MONSANTO is [suing the farmers]( http://www.salon.com/2014/01/13/the_supreme_court_wont_stop_monsanto_from_suing_farmers/) for patent infringement!   Their gmo seed is ruining non gmo fields and the victim is sued.\n \nIn 3rd world countries Monsanto is undermining local food supplies and making farmers homeless.  They go into places such as India with slick sales pitches for their seeds.  Farmers plow under their local varieties and buy Round Up seed.   But Round Up seed varieties aren't guaranteed to grow as well everywhere in India as they grow in the soil and climate of Monsanto test areas.  Or a stretch of unusually bad weather comes through.   The crop is poor or ruined.  The old way allowed the farmers to try again next year with some seed they saved, but the Monsanto crop can't be replanted.  Farmers are finding themselves ruined.  Many are losing their family farms.   It's created an epidemic of [suicides dubbed the GM Genocide]( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1082559/The-GM-genocide-Thousands-Indian-farmers-committing-suicide-using-genetically-modified-crops.html).  One source says [250,000 Indian farmers have already committed suicide relating to this]( http://www.seattleorganicrestaurants.com/vegan-whole-foods/indian-farmers-committing-suicide-monsanto-gm-crops/).\n\n&gt;They are also rated one of the top companies to work for if you are LGBTQ, so in that sense they are fairly progressive compared to other companies.\n\nWhat if there are military chemical weapons corporations that are welcoming to homosexuals.  Doesn't make the company as a whole good.\n\n&gt;So why should I consider Monsanto to be a bad company, or a company not worthy of defending?\n\nI don't have a problem with Gm crops in general.   But I think people have a right to choose if they want to buy gm food or not.  Producers have a right to say if their produce is gm free.  But Monsanto doesn't want us to make up up own minds.  They devote a lot of resources to [oppose gm]( http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/food-labeling.aspx).   \n\nSo let's see:\n\n- they knowingly contaminate non-gm farmers fields,  possibly ruining that crop AND then they sue the victims for \"patent infringement\"\n\n- they go into 3rd world countries selling their product to any peasant farmer who buys the sales pitch.   When seed fails, family loses farm.  Some farmers commit suicide.\n\n- seeds can't be replanted.  This means a massive loss of heirloom / traditional varieties and loss of farmers power to develop their own hybrids.   Farmers develop an unhealthy dependence on buying new seeds every year from the same corporation.\n\n- round up isn't harmless to environment, wild life, or humans as Monsanto swore \n\n- they try their best to keep their product hidden from consumers.  They want to take away knowledge and choice from us.\n\nAll this to sell a herbicide that isn't working so well any more.

They claim glyphosate can't hurt people because it relies on an enzyme pathway only found in plants.  They didn't do safety testing in mammals.  Now scientists are finding glyphosate [isn't breaking down quickly in the environment the way they said it would  and it's affecting lower life forms]( http://www.sierraclub.ca/national/programs/health-environment/pesticides/glyphosate-fact-sheet.shtml).  Roundup turns out to be toxic to people after all ([toxicity on Wikipedia page]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate).  Farmers have died from it.\n\nWhat do I consider evil?    It's using their power to influence legislation to allow for the release of open pollinated GMO crops. Open pollinated means the genetics from one field cab blow and end up in a conventional crop field.   Not only do they take no responsibility for when their genes contaminate farmers who don't want GMO crops, MONSANTO is [suing the farmers]( http://www.salon.com/2014/01/13/the_supreme_court_wont_stop_monsanto_from_suing_farmers/) for patent infringement!   Their gmo seed is ruining non gmo fields and the victim is sued.\n \nIn 3rd world countries Monsanto is undermining local food supplies and making farmers homeless.  They go into places such as India with slick sales pitches for their seeds.  Farmers plow under their local varieties and buy Round Up seed.   But Round Up seed varieties aren't guaranteed to grow as well everywhere in India as they grow in the soil and climate of Monsanto test areas.  Or a stretch of unusually bad weather comes through.   The crop is poor or ruined.  The old way allowed the farmers to try again next year with some seed they saved, but the Monsanto crop can't be replanted.  Farmers are finding themselves ruined.  Many are losing their family farms.   It's created an epidemic of [suicides dubbed the GM Genocide]( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1082559/The-GM-genocide-Thousands-Indian-farmers-committing-suicide-using-genetically-modified-crops.html).

Doesn't make the company as a whole good.\n\n&gt;So why should I consider Monsanto to be a bad company, or a company not worthy of defending?\n\nI don't have a problem with Gm crops in general.   But I think people have a right to choose if they want to buy gm food or not.  Producers have a right to say if their produce is gm free.  But Monsanto doesn't want us to make up up own minds.  They devote a lot of resources to [oppose gm]( http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/food-labeling.aspx).   \n\nSo let's see:\n\n- they knowingly contaminate non-gm farmers fields,  possibly ruining that crop AND then they sue the victims for \"patent infringement\"\n\n- they go into 3rd world countries selling their product to any peasant farmer who buys the sales pitch.   When seed fails, family loses farm.  Some farmers commit suicide.\n\n- seeds can't be replanted.  This means a massive loss of heirloom / traditional varieties and loss of farmers power to develop their own hybrids.   Farmers develop an unhealthy dependence on buying new seeds every year from the same corporation.\n\n- round up isn't harmless to environment, wild life, or humans as Monsanto swore \n\n- they try their best to keep their product hidden from consumers.  They want to take away knowledge and choice from us.\n\nAll this to sell a herbicide that isn't working so well any more.

The wheat varieties that you refer to are \u201cgenetically modified\u201d through traditional plant breeding, and this question brings some important issues to the surface: the manner in which new wheat varieties are created and traits that serve as realistic targets. Singled out here is plant height, and whether or not changes in plant height may impact other characteristics of wheat.\n \nFirst, let\u2019s step back and briefly examine the fundamental process by which new wheat varieties are created by scientists employed either by land-grant universities or private companies. No matter where it occurs, today\u2019s wheat varieties are the product of the painstaking process of crossing parents and selecting offspring, often called conventional breeding. To suggest anything else would be misrepresentative of the current science, and art, of wheat breeding, which truly began in the United States. in the 1920s. More specifically, parents with complementary traits are hybridized via natural fertilization to produce offspring with new genetic combinations (not new genes). New combinations are chosen that may lead to slightly higher yield potential, better resistance to diseases or insects, or perhaps better characteristics that enable such a wide variety of foods to be consumed from one plant species.\n \nQuite often, parents are chosen from wheat\u2019s ancient lineage to reintroduce genes indigenous to ancestral or related species of modern-day wheat. This method still employs crossing, not genetic engineering. However, if we think of the ancient relatives of modern-day wheat as genetic reservoirs, then at some point we will have exhausted those reservoirs as a means to combat ever-emerging diseases and insects, or to address other challenges our farmers may face. With that perspective, university and private-company scientists are committed to adopting the technologies we so desperately need to unleash or capture new genetic reservoirs critical to wheat\u2019s stable production and healthy consumption. That is in our future.\n \nBut let\u2019s stay focused on the past, as one characteristic or trait that has received worldwide attention in wheat breeding-research has been plant height. Wheat evolved and was domesticated in many sizes, and that diversity is readily reflected in ancient and modern wheat accessions maintained at the USDA National Small Grains Collection, varying from less than 12 inches to more than 60 inches. As a reference point, a healthy wheat plant growing in the U.S. Great Plains will average about 30 to 35 inches. In my own nurseries, I will look for progeny that are waist height or slightly shorter. Quite frankly, Oklahoma wheat farmers tell me, \u201cYour varieties are too tall!\u201d With greater height comes a higher center of gravity, which does not bode well when the wind comes sweeping down the plains. Farmers wish to have a wheat crop that is tall enough to swiftly harvest, but not so tall that the crop cannot remain standing through harvest. Wheat naturally has the ability to produce extremely short or \u201cdwarf\u201d types, but those would not be advantageous either to a mechanical harvest or to a bountiful yield.\n \nFortunately for wheat breeders, the wide genetic diversity for plant height, often associated inversely with straw strength, allows the development of varieties best fit for a certain environment. For example, in more arid environments, farmers prefer varieties with greater potential for height, whereas in those environments with greater rainfall, reduced height is preferred.  This is true even within a given state, depending on rainfall distribution patterns.\n \nIn wheat, multiple genes confer varying degrees of height expression. In the scientific literature you will find certain height genes named, or numbered, with the prefix \u201cRht\u201d for \"Reduced height.\" The presence of certain Rht genes, or combinations thereof, sets the genetic range of height expression for a given variety.  \u201cSemidwarf\u201d wheat varieties represent the predominant wheat type cultivated around the world.  The height level mentioned above (30 to 35 inches) is common for semidwarf varieties grown in the Great Plains, though not all varieties grown in the Great Plains possess a known Rht gene.\n \nThe Rht genes which reside in many U.S. varieties today come with a lifesaving story, courtesy of the old 19th-century Japanese wheat variety, daruma, from which height reduction was transferred by conventional breeding in the 1950s by wheat breeders Orville Vogel and Norman Borlaug. Their research spawned a new era of wheat varieties that would eventually ignite the Green Revolution and save this planet from malnutrition, or worse yet, starvation (for more, see The Viking in the Wheat Field, by Susan Dworkin, Walker and Co., New York). Semidwarf varieties of both wheat and rice helped turn entire countries once starving for food into leading exporters of food. Semidwarf varieties can also contribute toward a sustainable agriculture. A wheat variety that expresses some degree of height reduction directs precious resources, such as water and fertilizer, primarily to that part of the plant consumed by humans, and not to the vegetative parts. I emphasized here the notion that height reduction in wheat is not \u201call-out.\u201d Published research has shown that average plant height in the Great Plains has decreased from about 39 inches in 1960 (before semidwarf varieties emerged) to about 31 inches now.\n \nLet\u2019s now consider the relationship between plant height and nutritional content of the grain, specifically gluten, which as a storage protein provides a young wheat seedling with energy and as a grain protein provides us with essential amino acids for our own growth and development. Very simply, most of the wheat storage protein genes can be found on different chromosomes than the Rht genes. Thus the two traits are not inherited together, and, further, as already mentioned, many modern varieties of wheat grown today in the United States do not possess a Rht gene. \n \nOn a final note, starch and protein contents in wheat occur in inverse proportions, and thus, as one fraction increases on a percentage basis, the other decreases. Depending on the end use of wheat flour, some wheat varieties are higher in protein (and thus gluten), while others are lower in protein. The prevailing types of gluten molecules may vary depending on the end use. For flour used in confectionary products, a more mellow gluten and lower gluten content (more starch) are preferred, whereas for certain types of bread and pasta, a stronger gluten and higher gluten content are preferred. The desired amount and type of gluten in a wheat crop is determined not only by the variety but also by the environmental conditions (weather, soil, etc.) under which it is grown. With such inherent variability and fluctuation in the amount, or kind, of gluten that enters our daily diet, and with no scientific evidence that gluten content has systematically shifted with wheat breeding (Kasarda, D., J. Agric. Food Chem., 2013, 61:1155-1159), it is no surprise that any apparent increase in the incidence of celiac disease, or obesity rate, is unattributable to wheat breeding or to varieties with a certain level of height reduction. For a more complete and scientific examination of nutritional myths connected to wheat, see the article by nutrition specialist Dr. Julie Miller Jones in Cereal Foods World  (57:177-189; 2012).*\n\n[source](http://gmoanswers.com/ask/probably-first-well-known-gmo-food-has-circulated-our-food-supply-decades-genetically-modified)\n\nPlease allow me to save face.
