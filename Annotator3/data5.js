I think the evidence is stacked against us:\n\n* We have a finite physical brain, which can only hold a finite amount of information. The brain is vastly smaller than the universe.\n* Even on Earth, which is an unfathomably small part of the universe, processes occur that we don\u2019t understand; both macroscopic (economics) and microscopic (biochemistry).\n* It is already the case that a vanishingly small proportion of people in the world fully understand the latest physics/cosmology (quantum mechanics and general relativity), and they are unable to unify them into a single non-contradictory theory.\n* There are already things that man-made machines understand better than any single human does (e.g. chess).\n\nI think the analogy with the ant is sound.

Specifically, I would caution you against using the term \"fight\" in context with Camus, as he certainly does not believe we can do anything to counteract the absurdity of the universe. We can either choose to deny it (and thus delude ourselves) or to accept it and find a way to continue living *within* and *as if*. The second section of *Sisyphus*, about Absurd Men, explores various ways we may go about this: living the life of fleeting, repeated pleasures like Don Juan or taking on the continual life/death cycle of the Actor, etc. It's all about living a life that embraces the absurdity and still finds a way to continue; that's the ultimate ability of human consciousness.

It does not care if you were good or bad, poor or rich, smart or dumb. It doesn't reward you based on your morals, but by sheer coincidence.\n\nI think that you are actually looking at this back to front. People have created their concepts of good and bad *from* somewhere. After all, in your world of indifference, there *is* no good and bad. A rock can't be 'bad'. An ant can't be 'bad'. So how come a dog can be 'bad' and a human can be 'bad'? Where did the idea of 'bad' even come from?\n\nWe tend to say that things are 'bad' if they endanger our chance of passing on genetic material that is closest to us. We are a group animal, and we rely on one another to survive. So murder is bad, because you are removing human genes from the pool. But murdering someone who is threatening to kill your child is forgiveable, because you are removing genes more different from your own in order to save genes that are more similar to your own.\n\nThings that benefit other people are good, because we rely on one another so much. It helps to enforce the bonds between us and makes us stronger as a group.\n\nWe also have 'good' things that simply act as social cement, like wearing clothes is 'good' in some societies, but in others it is fine to walk around with bare boobs.\n\nSo yes - none of it matters, but it isn't particularly random and meaningless. You are a human, so if you live your life fully as a human should, then you will feel much better as it will fit with all your animal instincts. So fitting in well with a group, having others who love you, being hugged etc all make you *feel* different."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2ntnrm", "body": "Totals: 7 days, 131 posts, 9,776 comments.   \nIncluded in this report: The top 131 posts, and 9,158 of the top comments, by 2,344 distinct authors.   \nThere was 1 gilded post, and 3 comments were gilded.   \n\n\n---   \nSee the comments for detailed reports and charts.   \n\n\n---   \n**Most Popular Posts**   \n\n---\n|Score|Author|Post Title|\n|:-|-|-|\n|1769|/u/ILookLikePopeFrancis|[CMV: For half a century, smoking was advertised as empowering to women.

There's a reason such specific skill-training classes are still available, and it is to strengthen that specific skill, rather than just gambling that the accountants will be good memos which will maybe-sort-of transfer into other writing skills.\n\nSimilarly, while history might not be immediately obvious in the skills it teaches outside of reinforcing some that you get in other classes it provides you with knowledge you would not otherwise get.

For some perspective, I rent, which means:\n\n* My landlord has the right to enter my apartment pretty much whenever they want, with appropriate notice.\n* I'm required to keep the apartment in reasonably good condition, because they might come inspect. For example:\n* I'd like to mount a TV on the wall, but I'll have to check my lease first, and I might need to ask my landlord.\n* I thought about adopting a kitten, but pets are not allowed on this property *at all.*\n\nNow, these are generally pretty reasonable, but the difference is, in my case, it's all up to the landlord, even while I'm making payments. In your case, the bank doesn't get involved unless you *stop* making payments.\n\nThere are advantages to renting, though. For one, it's a lot less of a commitment -- if you want to move out of your house, you'll need to find someone to buy it, and you'll need to do... whatever it is you do with any outstanding mortgage when you sell it. If I want to move out, I only have to find a new place to live and move there, it's my landlord's job to figure out what to do with the old apartment."}, {"id": "cmgn20m", "body": "I have a mortgage, but I own my home.

The key word here is \"equity\".     \n     \nWhen you rent, that money goes to the landlord and you'll never see it again. It's his money now and when you leave it stays his money no matter how much you have given him over the years.     \n     \nWhen you buy, the bank actually pays off the seller. It's a loan sure, but as you pay down that loan, you gain equity in the property. Now if the property gains value (as it often does) while you own it, that additional value is yours. This means that when you go to sell the property, the buyer's bank pays your bank the value of the property not just what's remaining on the loan. The bank get's theirs, you get the remaining equity (what you paid into the property) and any additional money you made from the improved value of the property.     \n     \nYes, there is a chance that you could take a loss. The recent housing bubble showed that. A lot of people bought houses only to watch the value drop below what they bought it for (negative equity) but now many people have bought houses when the market hit bottom and interest rates are low. The value on my house has nearly doubled since I bought it. If I sold my house tomorrow, I would make back all the money that I put into it, and almost as much as I bought it for.     \n     \nThis gives me a RIDICULOUS amount of credit that I never had when I was leasing. I can borrow against my equity if I need to or simply use that positive credit at other places (like buying a car, or using it to improve my house and thus further improving it's value).     \n     \nAn added plus; the interest I pay on my mortgage is tax exempt. This means that even though I am paying close to what I was paying when I was renting each month, every year I get a huge tax return for all the interest I pay.

This vastly increases your horizontal viewing angle which will negatively impact your ability to see the entire movie or play a console game effectively.\n\nSo ok, lets say you really like your nose up to the screen, that presents another problem, most living rooms are not setup to accommodate a TV that big or to sit that closely. There's a reason why 4K TVs are moving into the 85\" range, because the average viewing distance of most people barely takes full advantage of most of the 1080p tvs in people's houses right now.\n\nFurthermore, to go to 4K you have to dump your plasma in favor of arguably inferior LCD/LED technology that fails to produce effective black levels for the most part in comparison. The only technology on the horizon that can beat plasma in black levels is OLED.\n\nSo we need a 85\" OLED 4K TV to sit a comfortable 11 feet away, and that's going to be pricey and isn't even available yet. And that's saying nothing of the problem of upscaling older content that's likely to stay in 1080p for a considerable period of time. Upscaling that 1080p blu-ray, PS4 (which is already being upscaled to 1080P), or satellite image is going to make the picture blurry and inferior to a true 1:1 1080P image under the exact same conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, 4K isn't ready for prime time, and likely won't be for at least another 5-10 years. The proper seating distance for a modern 1080P TV is about 1.6 times the diagonal length of the screen based on my research. I don't know what the comparable distance is exactly for 4K (guessing 1.0-1.1x since it's double the horizontal resolution), but the technical limitations are not going to accommodate most people.\n\nIf you're looking to improve your AV experience most people would be vastly better served by getting a decent audio system for under $1K."}, {"id": "cmgm7tj", "body": "I've gotten to the point where, every time I see this, I get reminded of my aunt.

One of their flagship products currently is a 55\" TV that has 4K and 3D capabilities - for a hefty price of $2,000(though this price range is nothing new for TV owners, there were even CRTs that were more expensive *and* smaller than that).  They also have more reasonably priced 4K TVs around $600.  Some games are already pushing into the 4K spectrum.  \n\nAlso, it's definitely possible for BD to carry 4K, and while Netflix's jump from 1080p to 4k is huge, it's nothing that fiber can't handle.  The main problem there is motivating the big telecoms to actually roll out fiber.  There's nothing inherently wrong or incapable in our current technology as far as delivery goes.  Heck, a typical 1080p Netflix stream takes up 3 Mbps.  4k is more accurately defined as 3840x2160(as opposed to 1920x1080), so each side is 2x larger than before, resulting in an overall 4x increase in size.  So, assuming a factor of 4x, you just need 12 Mbps to handle a Netflix stream, and 20 Mbps isn't hard to come by these days(there are always areas that aren't up-to-date, but that's a rabbit hole on its own).\n\nIt's currently being projected that 4k streaming and BD will start hitting mainstream at the end of 2015 or early 2016.

This vastly increases your horizontal viewing angle which will negatively impact your ability to see the entire movie or play a console game effectively.\n\nSo ok, lets say you really like your nose up to the screen, that presents another problem, most living rooms are not setup to accommodate a TV that big or to sit that closely. There's a reason why 4K TVs are moving into the 85\" range, because the average viewing distance of most people barely takes full advantage of most of the 1080p tvs in people's houses right now.\n\nFurthermore, to go to 4K you have to dump your plasma in favor of arguably inferior LCD/LED technology that fails to produce effective black levels for the most part in comparison. The only technology on the horizon that can beat plasma in black levels is OLED.\n\nSo we need a 85\" OLED 4K TV to sit a comfortable 11 feet away, and that's going to be pricey and isn't even available yet. And that's saying nothing of the problem of upscaling older content that's likely to stay in 1080p for a considerable period of time. Upscaling that 1080p blu-ray, PS4 (which is already being upscaled to 1080P), or satellite image is going to make the picture blurry and inferior to a true 1:1 1080P image under the exact same conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, 4K isn't ready for prime time, and likely won't be for at least another 5-10 years. The proper seating distance for a modern 1080P TV is about 1.6 times the diagonal length of the screen based on my research. I don't know what the comparable distance is exactly for 4K (guessing 1.0-1.1x since it's double the horizontal resolution), but the technical limitations are not going to accommodate most people.\n\nIf you're looking to improve your AV experience most people would be vastly better served by getting a decent audio system for under $1K."}, {"id": "cmgnv44", "body": "Either you want a home theater or you don't.

A linguist would tell you that language is variable and that there is no correct way to pronounce anything. What the dictionary defines as standard pronunciation is simply one pronunciation within the confines of the dialect used in the dictionary.\n\nYour view seems really to ride on the belief that Standard American English is somehow more correct of a dialect. That's not really the case at all, it just happens that General American is the accent of power in the United States and so is the dialect taught in schools.\n\nTo put it another way: were the dialect spoken in Maryville, TN the most populous and prominent dialect in the United States, it would make sense than the \"Mar-uh-vul\" pronunciation, as you describe it, would be the \"correct\" pronunciation, no? That must mean that neither pronunciation is any more correct than the other. In fact, there's certainly a valid argument to be made that any pronunciation which is understandable is \"correct,\" as it achieves the end goal of communication.\n\nNone of this is to say, of course, that there isn't an official pronunciation of the name on record somewhere.

But it is true that there may very well be an official way to pronounce the name, I suppose, though such a standard is effectively useless if nobody uses it.\n\nEdit: As an addendum, it's also worth noting that spelling does not in any sense dictate or often even reflect pronunciation.

With differences like the pronunciation of Mexico in English and Spanish, I go with the pronunciation of whatever language you're speaking. It's incorrect to say \"M\u00e9xico (meh-hee-co)\", when speaking English. It's incorrect to say \"Mexico (mek-sik-oh)\" when speaking Spanish.\n\nWhat about different pronunciations within English? Unlike the French language, there is no Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise for the English language. Some organizations, like the Merriam Webster Dictionary come close, but they have competition, like the Oxford Dictionary, and neither of those organizations are recognized by every Anglophone country as the premier and officially recognized Authority on the English language.\n\nSo since there is no official organization policing the English language, who decided how things are pronounced? The answer is, whoever is speaking decides how it is pronounced. **There is no \"correct pronunciation\"**. With differing pronunciations, within the same language, the most important thing is consistency, and communicability. In other words, the \"best pronunciation\" (although not the official or correct one) is whatever is the most mutually intelligible. The best pronunciation is whatever makes talking to people easier.\n\nThere are also time when communication is not the primary goal. Language is often political. Myanmar/Burma is an interesting case. The current ruling government wants the Anglo-sphere to use the name \"Myanmar\". Many English speaking countries continue to use the name \"Burma\". This is, in part, because the party deemed to have won the 1990 elections prefers \"Burma\". The military Junta that currently rules the country prefers \"Myanmar\". \n\nThe local ethnic majority speak Burmese, and call their country \"Myanma\" (no -r). Local ethnic minorities, who don't speak Burmese, are more familiar with the name \"Burma\". No matter what name you choose, you're going to piss off someone.

It's unfortunate - b/c CMV is typically better than that.\n\nFinally, I think it's really unfortunate that the media is incessantly trying to pull the race card on this issue, when I still haven't seen any direct evidence of it.  Yet, I *do* see direct evidence of this being another very sad example of a cop abusing their power, in a line of recent epidemic abuse-by-cop examples that are plaguing the US, right now. Unfortunately the media just wants to divide and conquer the population by crying racism, instead of tying this into the literal hundreds of recent examples of cops gunning down unarmed or relatively nonthreatening people (and kids.)  \n"}, {"id": "cmhr7al", "body": "&gt;Was there any evidence beyond the races of the two parties, involved?

You may not have a very clear notion of exactly which circumstances legitimately impose duties on you and which do not. My view, though, is that if a circumstance is unjust, and it is within your power to potentially affect that situation, and the exercise of that power only calls upon you to make reasonable sacrifices (or sacrifices that are proportionate to the size of both the injustice and probability of having an effect), then you have a duty to exercise that power. You are the beneficiary of a set of circumstances that have been created for you by others - now mostly long dead - who behaved in a similar way. They made reasonable sacrifices - in some cases, unreasonable sacrifices - to \"make the world a better place\", in the interests of \"humankind\". They didn't know you personally, but you ended up being one of the people who benefited from what they did. As a beneficiary of the generosity of previous generations, you have some obligation to pay that generosity on to subsequent generations.  \n\nHowever, what precisely are the limits of \"reasonable chance to affect injustice\" and \"reasonable sacrifice\" or \"proportional sacrifice\" are up to your own judgement. I'd say \"having to listen to people arguing for boycotts and protests\" easily falls within the ambit of \"reasonable sacrifice\". Actually participating in a boycott or a protest, on the other hand... maybe it's too much. Or maybe the reason that listening to people asking you to do it makes you uncomfortable is that there's a part of you that's thinking, \"hey, maybe I actually have some obligations here...\" which makes another part of you want to shout that part down with a declaration that no such obligations exist. Or maybe not.  \nI think reflecting on the extent of your duties, though, is best done in the context of remembering how seriously those who fought for the rights you now enjoy took their duty. If you're not contemplating your own duty with a commensurate sense of seriousness, you may be a free-rider."}, {"id": "2ns94k", "body": "I'm sure many of you are aware of the controversies around the Ferguson shooting, protests, and riots.

By removing the limbs and cooking them separately, you can get all parts of the turkey cooked to equal doneness. \n\nFrom the description you're giving, it really just sounds like you're drastically overcooking your turkey.

No one wants to spend hours cooking a turkey when they can make chicken, steak, ham, etc. in a shorter period of time. As for your point about there not being chains based around turkey, this goes back to the point that turkey takes a lot more time to cook than other meats. You're also forgetting that turkey is a popular sandwich topping that is commonly used at sub chains like Subway.
