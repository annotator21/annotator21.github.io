The single of dice is die.  \"Dices\" is a verb that means to play with dice or to cut food into small cubes.\n\nNow on to your debate.  It seems to me that the claim you are making is that order is nothing more than an artificial preference for a smaller subset of results from larger set of equally probable results.  That any arrangement of matter is equally probable, so there is nothing special about things being arranged neatly vs things arranged chaotically.  To me, that's not disproving the existance of order, it's only claiming that order isn't \"special\".  I think that's an easy thing to throw out when referring to results from dice, but does it still apply when speaking to the arrangement of atoms in the human body?

It's in such an unfinished state, in fact, that we haven't even standardised parameters for success; they are mostly defined intuitively, or not explicitly spelled out, or both.\n\nProponents of each moral system tend to try to formalize their own standards for success (\"what does it mean for a choice to be right?\") at the *same time* as they try to develop a way to reach those standards (\"how can we best select the right choices?\"). Although this leaves philosophical discussion in a complete mess, I do believe it's valid, and it shouldn't lead you to believe that statements like \"utilitarianism is best\" involve circular reasoning.\n\nEssentially, the statement \"utilitarianism is the best way to make moral decisions\" actually implies two statements at once: \"[my variety of] utilitarianism has identified the correct parameters for success when making moral decisions\", and \"utilitarianism is the best way to consistently achieve those parameters\". The same would be true for \"virtue ethics is the best way to make moral decisions\", \"obeying the Bible is the best way to make moral decisions\", and any similar statement.\n\n(Incidentally, your question was kind of splitting hairs in the first place, which is what made me so confused. Most moral systems (and amongst utilitarians, most utility functions) share a very similar set of success criteria, similar to the point that they're essentially interchangeable in casual conversation. This is why Christianity has gradually transmuted from \"we must obey God because he is our wise leader\" into \"we must obey God because he has a Great Plan which will maximize utility for everybody, forever\", despite the fact that the second sentiment is mostly absent from the Bible. I suspect this is because, when pressed, most people will intuitively come up with a pretty conventional set of fundamental moral goals, rather than wacky stuff like \"maximizing the incidence of Nirvana\" or \"maximizing the deference of each human to their rightful leader\".)"}, {"id": "cmfh6e9", "body": "Minor derail ahead, but:\n\n&gt; Further, one of the greatest criticisms of utilitarianism is that it's impossible to calculate expected utility in the moment of action, and that unintended consequences often outweigh expected utility.\n\nThat sounds less like \"utilitarianism is wrong\" and more like \"although utilitarianism is the right way to judge which decisions are correct, choosing a correct decision is hard\".\n\nUsing simple moral rules as fast and effective heuristics isn't contrary to utilitarianism, unless you go on to say \"simple moral rules are the *only* way to determine what's right and what's wrong\".\n\nAlthough maybe you were using the word \"utilitarianism\" to mean \"a naive application of utilitarianism to decision-making\", rather than \"the principle that it's possible to judge actions' relative worth based solely on their consequences\"?

In other situations, from the perspective of utility pacifism might actually be morally obligatory.\n\nFurther, one of the greatest criticisms of utilitarianism is that it's impossible to calculate expected utility in the moment of action, and that unintended consequences often outweigh expected utility. Pacifism seems to vibe with this pretty well--it's entirely possible to imagine a version of rule utilitarianism that incorporates this criticism to say that it's better to hedge and avoid violence rather than risk far more devastating unintended consequences.\n\n\n&gt;That an absolute pacifist relies on others to commit violence for their own continued safety, for example the subduing of a dangerous criminal by police forces may be violent, and that any personal code which requires other persons to break said code in order to be followed cannot be moral.\n\nThis argument doesn't make any sense. The pacifists doesn't require anyone else to do anything. It's entirely possible to imagine a pacifist who doesn't call the police, has no expectation of a national security force to protect them, and would be willing to martyr themselves in the face of violence. If anything, the fact that people take these actions without interrogating the pacifist's beliefs is just demonstration that people are disrespecting the pacifist, not that the pacifist is relying on violence. \n\n\n&gt;Furthermore that there can be a just war.\n\nThis is highly contentious and simply begs the question of pacifism in the first place. There's also a significant distinction between war as a necessary evil and a just war.

A retail store hires retail employees on the basis of day to day demand--i.e. how many employees need to be at the register on any given Thursday, not only on the basis of Black Thursday. Perhaps they wouldn't be able to hire as many seasonal workers if their profits were slightly diminished by not being open on Thursday, but even if some seasonal employees wouldn't be hired and a few regular employees would be laid off, I don't see any reason to believe that not being open on Thursday would have anything but a very marginal effect on employment."}, {"id": "cmfelos", "body": "They could do that, but in this economy, I am fairly certain that they could find people to replace them fairly quickly.

If they had their way, they would like their employees to work all day every days.\n\nThe people working for them are not risk takers, they are employees. If their means of working under their bosses were not regulated in detail, they would be at the mercy of their bosses to earn a living. Since risk takers (bosses) thrive in competition, the employees would be the ones to be boned in such a competitive landscape.\n\nThe employees want a say over their working conditions and terms. Bosses want return on their risks and investments. This is a self organising system. The asking price of the employees is decided not by a central agency, but the market. For instance, the rarer you are, the more money you make. There are a lot of people that qualify for a position literally everyone can handle, and they make little money. There are few people that can make informed decisions about software literally running a multibillion dollar company and the guys that do it make huge money. In this self organising system, there is a balance between supply and demand like in any self organising economic system.\n\nNow, there are people that don't want to work during those days. And there are ones that want to work, but since they are rare to come by, they are justified in expecting more money proportional to their rarity. When this proportion passes a critical point, the unrest signifying this *perceptual* (it doesn't have to be rational, we are not machines and humans are irrational)  imbalance becomes visible. Suddenly people find the means to self organise and they figure if they get to make enough noise,they can get what they want. Collective consciousness is a powerful thing; and if they are somehow able to get what they want, they will get it. That way the self organising system will balance itself.\n\nThink of it like how we treat most of the countries in the world like they are the rightful owner of that particular piece of land. But to make that piece of land *theirs*, they had to kill off, oppress or assimilate a significant portion of that land's previous rightful owners in a way that felt unjust *at that time*. And that land's previous owners did exactly the same thing to their previous owners. You can trace this process back to the times where every human on earth were hunter gatherers and started living as tribes. \n\nThis is how a self organising system works. Sometime, somewhere, a critical threshold comprising multitude of factors goes by; unrest and polarisation happens, people fight, one side wins, and it becomes the new norm. the system stabilises itself that way.\n\nSo there is no objective *right or wrong* in those situations. No country on this earth is the rightful owner of a particular piece of land if you think about it objectively or in a *timeless* manner. Each and every country fought their way into securing their lands. That land's previous owners did the same, and this goes back to the beginning of the universe basically. Similarly, each and every right we possess is formed by a similar manner of self organising process. When a huge shift occurs in some aspect of the system, it is always controversial, polarising and it eventually ends in favor of one side, until it occurs again. When a side wins, it becomes the new norm. Cue enough time, and people cannot imagine it being any other way. This applies to every little interaction you observe on planet earth.\n\nRetail workers work with their problems, but without causing significant problem or potential for combined unrest all year long. There are always problems, but they are always under the threshold. In this case, it is above the threshold. The reasons are vast and complicated, but it happens and they managed to get their voices heard. I'm not saying one side is objectively right or wrong. These things just happen, and one side will win. If things change, and stay unchallenged, give enough time and it will be the new norm that no one ever questions. The *current* norm is the result of such a process. The landscape of constraints the businesses are allowed to operate in, is subject to change all the time (just like world's borders) after all."}, {"id": "2nnurn", "body": "Every year we hear complaining about unfair business practices about making working these two days mandatory.

If striking meant that they wouldn't have to work those days next year or in future years.\n* Is there a requirement that  dissatisfaction in the workplace rises to the level off an \"injustice\" before workers before they strike? Whose requirement is this? It's not a legal one. Is it a moral one?\n* The requirement to work those days could be a surprise to some retail workers.

Going shopping on Thanksgiving certainly isn't critical to anyone.\n\nBlack Friday has a longer history of being associated with big sales associated with Christmas shopping.

I think faking sick or striking is perfectly reasonable if the employer demands too much of its employees.\n\nPeople take crap jobs because they're still in college, the job market is bad, they're not super-bright, whatever.

However, the nature of black Friday is that the Friday workday doesn't start when doors open at 9 or a few hours before like a normal day. Instead, the stores are opening earlier and earlier, now to the point that stores being open on Thursday is becoming normal. This means that one of about two retail holidays (Christmas is the other) has been taken away from workers who have no leverage to push back. What we're seeing is a segment of the workforce being pushed more and more to start earlier and earlier, outside of their normal agreed upon work schedules and with typically no compensation bonus (e.g. time and a half holiday pay or third shift pay). People who could spend thanksgiving with family instead need to sleep during the daytime on thanksgiving to allow them to work at 8pm Thursday to prepare for a midnight open.

As long as no one is getting hurt, I don't see a problem. And if you take a retail job, working Thanksgiving isn't going to be a surprise to you. It would be like taking a job at McDonalds and then complaining when you have to work the fryer. \n\nYes, it's busy. I imagine it's a lot of work.

Do we require perfection from our laws? No.\n\nThere is a good reason for this: Because we don't want to delay the useful solutions that hold 90% of the time and deny at least incremental progress from taking place. This appears in US jurisprudence as a standard of review called rational basis. Congress needs to have a rational basis for laws, but not every single facet of the factual premises that congress used in making a policy are reviewed by the court. Because Gay Marriage CAN'T produce children, so the argument goes, we should be satisfied that congress may have a rational basis in not extending to them marriage benefits.\n\nIt also must be remembered that a ban on gay marriage is not quite what is going on in the federal system. \"Marriage\" is a set of tax benefits designed to incentivize mated pairs. We AFFIRMATIVELY want people who can have children to do so, it is not that we NEGATIVELY do not want gay people to get married. Marriage is not a state of nature. We do not perform a rigorous review on heterosexual marriage for a few reasons: 1) to undergo such a review would weaken the incentive to have children, 2) as a marketing scheme we want people to think of marriage NOT as a governmental scheme but rather as a necessary step, even though that is a bit of a falsehood, 3) we think that the percentage of individuals that would fail such a review is small enough that the review itself would cost more than it saved.\n\nThe argument should avoid the more rigorous \"strict scrutiny\" standard because marriage laws are not directed at gay people but they are directed at all people. There is nothing in the law that stops a gay man from marrying a woman (gay or straight), however the law does stop two straight men or two straight women from getting married.\n\nThis has been a review of the basic legal arguments made in front of courts before Windsor.
