Minnesota's DFL (the MN arm of the democratic party) tends to be a lot more progressive than the national party, but that difference starts to disappear with the politicians that work more with the national party.  And the DFL is even large enough to have a wide array of political beliefs.  And you are much more likely to see these differences in your local elections, since these politicians aren't trying to appeal to the whole party.\n\nAlso, the elections for my local government (mayor, city council, etc.) Are non-partisan on the ballot, and from what I can tell from the people I have talked to, it works pretty much like the OP thinks it would: people either learn about the candidates or they don't vote at all.  Of course, I have no data to back this up, so take it for what it is worth.  Likewise, candidates for judge are also nonpartisan, although the parties often endorse one candidate or another.  Again, most people i talked to researched or abstained, and those that cared about the party endorsement could find it right away, so it didn't really matter that these weren't on the ballot.\n\nI see the value of trying to make voting take less effort and understanding of politics, because not everyone can have time to learn what they need to make an educated decision, and them not voting could skew the voter pool's representation of the constituency's political views.  However, I contend that that doesn't matter.  As long as there are no actual barriers to the information about the candidates or the act of voting, this would not skew the results in any meaningful way, except that it would skew to the political views of a more informed populace.

When the United States government passes a piece of legislation, who is responsible for it? Who ought to be punished if it's bad and rewarded if it's good? Without a consensus ahead-of-time as to who is responsible for the government's actions there can be no objective exercise of accountability for those actions. Is the president ultimately responsible? He, despite having no formal legislative powers, certainly has a bigger say on the process than any other individual. Is it congress? Which house? Which individuals? Anyone can justify blaming anyone they'd like. So nobody can truly be held accountable. How do you get good government if those in power can act with little fear of being blamed for bad policy? How can one expect the members of a legislative body to represent the interests and wishes of the people if they cannot be held accountable for failing to do so? Let's say you believe that the House of Representatives is responsible for the bad bit of policy. Okay. Which individuals? Is it the set of members who voted for the act? Is it the members who voted down amendments to the act that would have improved it substantially? Is it the opposition members who will vote down everything who kept the House from getting something good? Everyone will come up with a different way of assigning blame. Nine times out of ten hey will blame either those they disagree with or those they happen to dislike on a personal level. Political parties bridge individuals. If the members of a party fail to act, they are blamed collectively. If they do something stupid, they are blamed collectively. In the US this not very fair as party discipline is extremely poor. In most well-established democracies party discipline is rock solid and there's no potential for divided government as only a single house of Parliament has real political power in principle. Both of which make for crystal-clear lines of accountability. \n\n2) Rational ignorance. Making the process of voting more difficult does not necessarily mean people will spend appreciably more time doing research. Doing research does not necessarily help over just choosing a party label. If you have single-winner elections, you will still end up with a least-common-denominator. The two most viable candidates will be least-common-denominator candidates. Just leaning to different ends of the spectrum. A single winner election favors a right-of-center candidate and a left of Center candidate. If either moves closer to the average voter's position, they lose support from the fringe and they average *voter's* position moves away from them due to fewer fringe voters turning out to vote. A quick and easy way of seeing which side a candidate leans to is not a bad thing. \n\n3) Not listing part endorsements does not mean parties do not make endorsements. Research done (to the extent that voters bother to do more research) will consist of looking up party affiliation. Nebraska has a \"nonpartisan\" legislature with no candidate or politician having a formal party affiliation. It's exactly the same. The politicians are cleanly delineated into Democrats and Republicans in practice. The \"nonpartisanship\" is a legal fiction.

Of course, no stat is perfect, but even yards and touchdowns pretty accurately indicate playing superiority. Also, if two quarterbacks have relatively close stats, most analysts won't put one on a pedestal.

The main team that I think could stand a chance against the worst NBA team is the [95-96 Kentucky basketball team.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995%E2%80%9396_Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball_team) This is a team that featured 9 future NBA players, 4 of which were drafted after that season with 3 of those 4 being drafted in the first round. They also went 34-2 and won the National Championship. I'll compare this team to the worst NBA team during the 95-96 season, which was the Vancouver Grizzlies. The Grizzlies were an expansion team that first joined the league during the 95-96 season and were absolutely awful. They ended the season with a 15-67 record which included losing streaks that lasted 19 and 23 games, as well as a stretch where they won 1 of 29 games (this was part of the 23 game losing streak). To put it bluntly, this team was awful.\n\nI'll use these players rookie stats as a baseline for how they would fare against NBA talent since it's probably the most fair method we have. Lets start with Antoine Walker, who would easily be Kentucky's best player against the Grizzlies. Walker averaged 17.5 ppg, 9 rpg, 3.2 apg, 1.3 spg, and 9 rpg in his rookie year in the NBA. He was a power forward and would be the team's go to option against the Grizzlies. He would be matched up against either Anthony Avent or Ashraf Amaya. Both of these players averaged 5-6 ppg, 5-6 rpg, and 1 or less apg, spg, and bpg. Walker wins this matchup by a landslide.\n\nThe next best player that Kentucky would have against NBA talent would be Ron Mercer, who would play small forward in this hypothetical game. Mercer averaged 15.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.2 apg, and 1.6 spg. These are solid stats for a rookie in the NBA, and it shows that Mercer would be a solid second option against the Grizzlies. The starting small forward for the Grizzlies that year was Chris King. King averaged 7.9 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 1.3 apg, and 0.9 spg. I'll give the edge to Mercer in this matchup.\n\nThe next best player from Kentucky based on rookie NBA stats was Derek Anderson. Anderson would play shooting guard in this hypothetical matchup, going up against Blue Edwards. In his rookie year, Anderson averaged 11.7 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 3.4 apg, and 1.3 spg. During the 95-96 season, Edwards averaged 13.5 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 2.6 apg, and 1.6 spg. This would be a very close matchup, but based on the stats alone Edwards would have a slight advantage, albeit a very small one.\n\nThe next best player from Kentucky this year was Tony Delk. Delk was a solid role player in his career in the NBA but was never a consistent starter. Anyways, as a rookie he averaged 5.4 ppg, 1.6 rpg, 1.6 apg, and 0.6 spg. Delk would be matched up with Greg Anthony. During the 95-96 season, Anthony averaged 14 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 6.9 apg, and 1.7 spg. I think it's obvious that Anthony wins this matchup relatively easily.\n\nThe worst player from this Kentucky team based on rookie NBA stats Nazr Mohammed. Mohammed didn't play very much during his rookie year in the NBA, and his stats reflect that as he averaged 1.6 ppg, 1.4 rpg, and 0.2 or less apg, spg, and bpg. Mohammed would be matched up with Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves. Reeves was a rookie during this season and although he is widely considered a bust, he put up decent numbers, averaging 13.3 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 1.4 apg, 0.6 spg, and 0.7 bpg. Reeves wins this matchup, but with Reeves being a rookie going up against Mohammed who was a college player in this hypothetical game, this matchup might not have been as lopsided as the stats suggest, especially when you consider the fact that Mohammed didn't get a lot of playing time as a rookie.\n\nThen there is the benches. This Kentucky team would have 4 future NBA players coming off the bench, while the Grizzlies would have the absolute bottom of the barrel players coming off their bench as they were an expansion team and essentially got to choose from other teams' worst players to make up their team.\n\nSo the matchups go like this:\n\nPG: Tony Delk vs. Greg Anthony; Advantage Anthony.\n\nSG: Derek Anderson vs. Blue Edwards; Advantage Edwards, but only a very slight advantage\n\nSF: Ron Mercer vs. Chris King; Advantage Mercer\n\nPF: Antoine Walker vs. Anthony Avent/Ashraf Amaya; Advantage Walker\n\nC: Nazr Mohammed vs. Bryant Reeves; Advantage Reeves, but keep in mind this is largely due to the fact that Mohammed didn't play nearly as much as Reeves in his rookie year.\n\nBench: Tie. Both benches would have NBA talent.\n\nBased on this analysis the NBA team would have a slight advantage, but the game would be very close, and 95-96 Kentucky would absolutely have a chance against the 95-96 Grizzlies. Also, keep in mind that these stats are season averages, but if you look at averages per 36 minutes for these players in their rookie years or from that season for the Grizzlies, some of these matchups are a little more even.\n\n**TLDR: The 95-96 Kentucky basketball team could have had a chance against the 95-96 Vancouver Grizzlies.

In terms of Walter McCarty and Ben Pope, yes both players were career role players, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they were still talented enough to play in the NBA and in McCarty's case for an extended period of time. Also, I don't think that McCarty's limited minutes in his rookie year is a completely valid argument to take away from his talent coming out of college. McCarty played on the Knicks during his rookie year who went 57-25 and finished 2nd in the East. On a team like that there really isn't going to be a lot of time to give to a rookie like McCarty. His next year he played for a worse Celtics team that went 36-46. He averaged 28.5 minutes per game that season. Now I'm not saying that McCarty didn't work to improve his game between his first and second seasons, but a jump in minutes like that from one year to another could also be attributed to the fact that he didn't have as much talent to compete with for playing time in Boston as he did in New York. If you were to have put a guy like Walter McCarty on the Grizzlies I think it's safe to assume that he would have payed more than 5 minutes a game.\n\nYou also have to remember that the bench players on the 95-96 Grizzlies were essentially players who weren't good enough to play on other teams. Many of the bench players on the 95-96 Grizzlies didn't last more than a few years after playing for that team.\n\nLike I've said, I don't believe that the best college basketball team any given year could beat the worst NBA team, but there are extraordinary circumstances like this where the best college basketball team could very well stand a chance against the worst NBA team."}, {"id": "clzywji", "body": "From year to year I generally agree with you that the best college basketball team wouldn't stand a chance against the worst NBA team, but I believe that there are a few specific exceptions to this. The main team that I think could stand a chance against the worst NBA team is the [95-96 Kentucky basketball team.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995%E2%80%9396_Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball_team) This is a team that featured 9 future NBA players, 4 of which were drafted after that season with 3 of those 4 being drafted in the first round. They also went 34-2 and won the National Championship. I'll compare this team to the worst NBA team during the 95-96 season, which was the Vancouver Grizzlies. The Grizzlies were an expansion team that first joined the league during the 95-96 season and were absolutely awful. They ended the season with a 15-67 record which included losing streaks that lasted 19 and 23 games, as well as a stretch where they won 1 of 29 games (this was part of the 23 game losing streak). To put it bluntly, this team was awful.\n\nI'll use these players rookie stats as a baseline for how they would fare against NBA talent since it's probably the most fair method we have. Lets start with Antoine Walker, who would easily be Kentucky's best player against the Grizzlies. Walker averaged 17.5 ppg, 9 rpg, 3.2 apg, 1.3 spg, and 9 rpg in his rookie year in the NBA. He was a power forward and would be the team's go to option against the Grizzlies. He would be matched up against either Anthony Avent or Ashraf Amaya. Both of these players averaged 5-6 ppg, 5-6 rpg, and 1 or less apg, spg, and bpg. Walker wins this matchup by a landslide.\n\nThe next best player that Kentucky would have against NBA talent would be Ron Mercer, who would play small forward in this hypothetical game. Mercer averaged 15.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.2 apg, and 1.6 spg. These are solid stats for a rookie in the NBA, and it shows that Mercer would be a solid second option against the Grizzlies. The starting small forward for the Grizzlies that year was Chris King. King averaged 7.9 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 1.3 apg, and 0.9 spg. I'll give the edge to Mercer in this matchup.\n\nThe next best player from Kentucky based on rookie NBA stats was Derek Anderson. Anderson would play shooting guard in this hypothetical matchup, going up against Blue Edwards. In his rookie year, Anderson averaged 11.7 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 3.4 apg, and 1.3 spg. During the 95-96 season, Edwards averaged 13.5 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 2.6 apg, and 1.6 spg. This would be a very close matchup, but based on the stats alone Edwards would have a slight advantage, albeit a very small one.\n\nThe next best player from Kentucky this year was Tony Delk. Delk was a solid role player in his career in the NBA but was never a consistent starter. Anyways, as a rookie he averaged 5.4 ppg, 1.6 rpg, 1.6 apg, and 0.6 spg. Delk would be matched up with Greg Anthony. During the 95-96 season, Anthony averaged 14 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 6.9 apg, and 1.7 spg. I think it's obvious that Anthony wins this matchup relatively easily.\n\nThe worst player from this Kentucky team based on rookie NBA stats Nazr Mohammed. Mohammed didn't play very much during his rookie year in the NBA, and his stats reflect that as he averaged 1.6 ppg, 1.4 rpg, and 0.2 or less apg, spg, and bpg. Mohammed would be matched up with Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves. Reeves was a rookie during this season and although he is widely considered a bust, he put up decent numbers, averaging 13.3 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 1.4 apg, 0.6 spg, and 0.7 bpg. Reeves wins this matchup, but with Reeves being a rookie going up against Mohammed who was a college player in this hypothetical game, this matchup might not have been as lopsided as the stats suggest, especially when you consider the fact that Mohammed didn't get a lot of playing time as a rookie.\n\nThen there is the benches. This Kentucky team would have 4 future NBA players coming off the bench, while the Grizzlies would have the absolute bottom of the barrel players coming off their bench as they were an expansion team and essentially got to choose from other teams' worst players to make up their team.\n\nSo the matchups go like this:\n\nPG: Tony Delk vs. Greg Anthony; Advantage Anthony.\n\nSG: Derek Anderson vs. Blue Edwards; Advantage Edwards, but only a very slight advantage\n\nSF: Ron Mercer vs. Chris King; Advantage Mercer\n\nPF: Antoine Walker vs. Anthony Avent/Ashraf Amaya; Advantage Walker\n\nC: Nazr Mohammed vs. Bryant Reeves; Advantage Reeves, but keep in mind this is largely due to the fact that Mohammed didn't play nearly as much as Reeves in his rookie year.\n\nBench: Tie. Both benches would have NBA talent.\n\nBased on this analysis the NBA team would have a slight advantage, but the game would be very close, and 95-96 Kentucky would absolutely have a chance against the 95-96 Grizzlies. Also, keep in mind that these stats are season averages, but if you look at averages per 36 minutes for these players in their rookie years or from that season for the Grizzlies, some of these matchups are a little more even.\n\n**TLDR: The 95-96 Kentucky basketball team could have had a chance against the 95-96 Vancouver Grizzlies. I generally agree with your view, but there are extraordinary examples (like this one) that invalidate it.**\n\nNinja Edit: Here are sources from the stats I referenced if you're curious.

Yes.  Over the course of an entire 82 game season last year, against NBA caliber defenses, 2 players shot over 60%.\n\nNot sure why that's relevant though.\n\nWe are talking about a single game.  I can pretty much assume every player in the NBA has shot over 60% in a game at least once in their career.  And again, that's against NBA level defenses.\n\nJust in the last week, the Kings scored 130 points on 55% shooting and the Warriors scored 121 on 58% shooting.   That's just in one random week of NBA action.\n\nAnd the difference between the Kings shooting 55% in that game and being able to shoot 65% would have only been 7 more made shots out of the 76 they took.  And assuming the same frequency of 2 &amp; 3 pointers they had for the game, those 7 extra made shots would equal 17 more points bringing them to 147 points for the game.\n\nIt's not that unreasonable to say that they could have done that just last Wednesday against an NBA team.  So is it really that much of a stretch to say that an NBA team could just do slightly better than that against a team whose oldest player is 22 years old?\n\nThat's also just looking at field goals.

Try to participate in (or observe) any rule or law making exercise and you would see the context behind their passing or enactment (not to mention the difficulty of crafting them).\n\nGenerally, laws or rules are passed or enacted with the common good objective, in mind. So long as a law or rule remain in force, there is a recognition by our society that it is good for us or that it is morally right.\n\nEach violation of the law or rule negatively affects society so it is not possible for a law or rule not to negatively affect anyone. Giving people discretion to break or follow a rule under the \"no damage doctrine\" will degrade the value of that law. Such degradation will result to a consequential degradation of other laws as people will also think that to follow them is discretionary (if no other person will be negatively affected). Without a system of laws, there will be chaos.\n\nAs an example, suppose three other people (not handicapped, with the same view) decide to park in the remaining slots, leaving one free, on the argument that they are not \"depriving someone else that would need it.\" What happens then if five handicapped individuals suddenly appear and parked somewhere else? Obviously, they are negatively affected. As we cannot foresee the future (or whether or not someone will need the slots within minutes or seconds), the law expressly reserves the slots, regardless of the number of free spaces and without any proviso that \"so long as no handicapped individual is being deprived of its use.\" It's merely a product of experience by the law drafters.\n\nGoing beyond that, even if the four that parked were correct, what is the effect to people who observed the violation? What about the guard? If they see that doing so would reward the violators (and if the guard thinks that there may be a need to be a little loose on the implementation of the prohibition), what will happen to the rule? It will become optional. This is what I mean when the law will be degraded. From there, it's just a matter of time before everyone else will just treat the law as optional. If you think this is not possible, just go to any country where bribery is prevalent and you would understand.\n\nThus, you should change your view that there is a possibility that violating a law or rule will not negatively affect anyone as it affects society, regardless of the extent of the violation.\n\nWe now go to your example of stupid laws or rules or those that are no longer in tune with what society considers as morally wrong. \n\nSociety is ever changing and what may be considered as morally right before may no longer be the same now. Before the law or rule is changed, however, it had to go through a process (whether through legislation, referendum, etc.) recognized by society in changing a law or rule. This means that the people (whether through a system or directly through a referendum) is the one who decides what the law is and not any individual. The public still decides what the common good is and not any individual. \n\nThus, prior to that systemic change, and even if there is public opinion against a law or rule, the law or rule still has to be followed because of the systemic effect a discretionary application will entail to the entire set of laws and rules."}, {"id": "2m0lve", "body": "If I am not negatively affecting someone else, why should I be stopped from doing something?

Your reply was almost completely devoid of the scientific evidence for evolution, which suggests to me that your problems with evolutionary theory don't have much to do with the evidence itself.\n\nThere are, in fact, many different sources that converge to confirm what we know about evolutionary theory.  We don't rely only upon the fossil record and simply guess.  There's biogeography, population genetics, homologous structures, vestigial organs and limbs, human chromosome number two, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the fact that our eyeballs are built inside out but octopus' aren't.  A vast body of knowledge from many, many different fields interacts to build our understanding of how evolution works.\n\nYou can read more about some of them [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-research.html) and [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/) (The former is colloquial synopsis, the latter is more technical).\n\n&gt; I understand that humans will search for answers, and truth, but presently, science, imhumbleo, is being agenda-ized\n\nScientific investigation has always had impacts upon contemporary ideology, whether intentional or not.  Most people don't realize this because most of what we're taught in science class is today accepted as common knowledge by the general public. But it was not always so.  Science has revolutionized the worldview of the public time after time, and mostly we look back after the dust has settled and aren't perturbed by it (there was a time when the suggestion that the Earth wasn't the center of the solar system caused a *shitstorm* because of the theological implications).  The reason that evolution in particular continues to be so controversial has nothing whatsoever to do with the evidence for it (we have more evidence for evolutionary theory than almost any other scientific theory).  It's because the natural implications of it run so contrary to the beloved ideas that so many people in the public *still* have.  The *resistance* to accepting that evolution is a fact is what is being driven by ideology.  Nobody is still threatened by the idea that the Earth goes around the Sun because their theological outlook has adapted to accommodate this information.\n\nActually, I think a clarification is in order.  Are you saying that:\n\n* Evolutionary theory and research are being **driven by** a particular ideology to find evidence to support presupposed conclusions.  (e.g. \"Phillip-Morris' scientists can't find any evidence that smoking causes cancer.\"  Big surprise.)\n\nor\n\n* Evolutionary theory and research, while solid science, are being co-opted by some people and **used for** ideologically-driven purposes that you don't think are supported by the evidence.

Evolutionary Science is *just information and theories*. If anything, it would be the people like Bill Nye and NDGT that you should consider as alienating presences but event that *shouldn't* make you consider science itself to be alienating.\n\nFor example, I can agree with ideas that Richard Dawkins wrote in his books (like The Selfish Gene) and still feel put off by his demeanor. But that doesn't mean that all of his ideas are automatically bad.\n\nIf you are looking for a source of information you find more palatable, you may be interested in looking at people like [Kenneth Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_R._Miller), who is a Cell Biologist and Microbiologist, and professor at Brown University. He was one of the key witnesses in the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District court case that ruled that Creationism was not suitable for *Science* Class in Schools (just about everyone agrees that the Bible can be taught in school for literary purposes). Probably most important for you (since you put such emphasis on your religion) is the fact that he is a strong-believing Roman Catholic. He is an excellent scientist that believes in Evolution, and he personally has a strong faith in his Christianity.\n\n&gt;...claiming that a belief in creationism is \"dangerous\" and holding humanity back. Those are two large influences in the scientific community directly attacking Christianity.\n\nThere is a difference in \"attacking Christianity\" and \"attacking Creationism\" that I think is important for this discussion.\n\nChristianity is a religion based on the belief that Jesus Christ of Nazareth existed and was the son of a God, who Christians believe to be the only God.\n\nCreationism is a story that **some** Christians believe to be an accurate explanation for the creation of the Universe.\n\nWhen they say that Creationism is \"dangerous\" and holding humanity back, they aren't attacking Christianity. They are only talking about a particular idea, one that the majority of Christians do not hold. Creationism is popular amongst the most religious countries, but most countries with large religious populations do not view Creationism in a positive light. There is a *very* important distinction there.\n\nAnd do you know what? Creationism itself probably *IS* an idea that is rightfully considered \"dangerous\" and holding humanity back, because when it WAS the law of the land, it was dangerous and it DID hold humanity back. Here's why...\n\nA belief in Special Creation requires belief in things that do not make logical sense with our understanding of the universe. It *requires* people to ignore evidence to the contrary and take it on faith alone. The problem with that is there is no definitive answer to how to view that or explain things. It is dangerous because people will obviously believe *their* interpretation is correct, and not allow for alternate views. In science, this is *dangerous*. Not in the *chance of death* way, but instead in a way that makes Scientists (and people in general) unable to talk to one another or discuss ideas.\n\nThe story of Special Creation can also very easily be considered as \"holding humanity back\". We have explanations that are better than Special Creation and explain much more. If we slowed every bit of progress we have had because someone said \"Yes, that's nice, but I have this completely unsubstantiated claim that says 'Cthulu did it'\" and got people to believe it, we would be much farther back than we are today.\n\nPerhaps a great (although romanticized) example of this is the Scopes Trial. The story of Creation was legally mandated to be the ONLY explanation talked about in Science Class, and when a Science Teacher taught a very general view of Evolutionary Theory, he was found guilty and charged a fine. For this man and for teachers and scientists around America, Creationism *was* dangerous and truly *did* stymie progress in the field.\n\n&gt;No one alive today has any more than ~100 years max of direct evidence verifiable by their own experiences. To claim to know otherwise is dangerous.\n\nActually, I would agree with you in a way you might not imagine. I (nor anyone) have no proof that even *my own* experiences are real. I could just be a brain in a jar and this could all be my imagination. Even if that were true, science allows me to explore *this* reality and come to explanations on how it works. More importantly, it allows other people to test my explanations and verify or refute them. This is far more trustworthy than simply taking people's experiences at face value all the time.\n\n&gt; I've exhaustively looked into the theory of evolution and it stands on the same foundation as Biblical, or simply religious beliefs: faith.\n\nThen quite frankly, you haven't really looked into either the Theory of Evolution *or* your Bible. People run experiments with Evolution and base it on experiments that have been tested and repeated over and over. The Bible is a collection of stories, some of which probably did happen and some of which that have not been proven. Even if the Bible is correct, we have no way of verifying it. *That*... is faith, and that can be good! But we haven't made progress relying on faith as an explanation. We have only made progress throughout human history by coming up with an explanation that helps us understand. People can have both faith and science in their lives."}, {"id": "clzv5yw", "body": "It's evolutionary science that alienates me, with luminaries like Bill Nye and NDGT claiming that a belief in creationism is \"dangerous\" and holding humanity back.

From Carl Sagan:\n\n&gt;Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light\u2010years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.\n\nThey're arguing against substituting science with mysticism.  Sagan:\n\n&gt;Science is a way to call the bluff of those who only pretend to knowledge. It is a bulwark against mysticism, against superstition, against religion misapplied to where it has no business being. \n\n&gt;I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us - then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls."}, {"id": "clzv5yw", "body": "It's evolutionary science that alienates me, with luminaries like Bill Nye and NDGT claiming that a belief in creationism is \"dangerous\" and holding humanity back.

The only evidence that the creation story of the bible is true is that the bible says it is true (there is even some disagreement over that). There is plenty of empirical evidence for evolution such as genetic similarities, transitional fossils, and directly observed evolution of plants and simpler organisms.\n\nConsider what humans have done with wolves in recent history. We have turned wolves into dogs ranging from a few pounds to over 250 pounds. They have pointy ears, floppy ears, fur, no fur, pointy noses, flat faces, etc. This was done in a short period of time by simply choosing which dogs reproduce. If a wolf can turn into a chihuahua in several thousand years, I'm certain that creatures will become unrecognizable from where they started after *millions* or *billions* of years.\n\n&gt;  it can and is interpreted differently by many reputable, intelligent people\n\nVirtually everybody who studies *the relevant fields* accepts evolution as fact.

In any situation where (1) information is copied and then the copies are copied, and so on, and (2) the rate of copying varies with the content of what is being copied, for any difference in copying rate, you can calculate the rate at which more-quickly-copied information will come to be more abundant than more-slowly-copied information.\n\nThere's a difference between faith and indirect evidence.  Organisms are similar and different in ways that are well explained by evolution.  Fossils exist.  Rocks contain isotopes, in amounts that are well explained by the premise that radioactive decay happened in the past as it does now, and that the rocks are the ages calculated.  And so on.

In most countries it is called Armistice Day or Remembrance Day (from hereon I will only use Armistice to avoid confusion with the US holiday of Memorial Day in May), while in the US it is called Veterans Day. I believe this distinction is important, and borderline insulting.\n\nNovember 11 1918 was the official end of World War I. The annual holiday was immediately proclaimed by most if not all participating nations, and has been marked as Armistice Day ever since. This was the case in the US until 1954, when it was changed to Veterans Day.\n\nNote that 1954 was the same year the words \"under god\" were added to the Pledge of Allegiance, and was the final year of Senator McCarthy's communist witchhunting (he was officially censured by the Senate in December 1954). Just like those events, I believe Veterans Day is a relic of the Cold War.\n\nSo what's the difference? Armistice Day is a solemn time to commemorate the end of war. It is in effect an anti-war holiday that reminds us of the most horrific and preventable waste of life committed by humans, specifically WWI. That war serves as a case study in why war is simply not worth fighting, and is therefore important to keep at the forefront of our collective memory.\n\nBy contrast, Veterans Day is effectively a celebration of war. It's celebrated in the most bombastic American way possible, with concerts, fireworks, and the like. Americans are expected to thank soldiers for their service year round, especially on November 11. In Armistice Day countries veterans are commemorated, but the attitude is one of sorrow (essentially saying we wish you hadn't had to suffer war) rather than appreciation.\n\nEven leaving aside how the day is marked, public consciousness of WWI in America is woeful. As a European American I am consistently astounded by how little Americans know about the war. After all, it was the third deadliest American conflict yet most people only know the name (and that's only because it's implied by WWII).\n\nTherefore Americans should go back to calling it Armistice Day, both to raise awareness of WWI and to have a day where we acknowledge that war is bad.\n\nIf we can't have Armistice Day, then Veterans Day should either be moved away from November 11 or canceled altogether. It's insulting to the WWI war dead to replace their holiday with a celebration of patriotism and nationalism, when that's exactly what WWI proved was bad.\n\nBy the way, please try and avoid turning this into a debate over whether veterans should be lauded or reviled. That CMV has been done to death and it's not what this is about. As I said above, I'm fine with Veterans Day taking place on some other date.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Tonight there will be [a concert](http://www.theconcertforvalor.com/) featuring among others Carrie Underwood, Bruce Springsteen, and Eminem.\n\n&gt; But i don't see Veteran's Day being a celebration of war, i see it more as a celebration of those who went to war and are still with us.\n\nThere's a huge difference in how those people are celebrated in the US compared to European countries. Americans are told to thank veterans for their service, whereas on Armistice Day Europeans mourn. The former presents war as a positive experience that makes people honorable, whereas the latter is all about how terrible it is.\n\nJuly 4th is more about the change of government than the war, especially since far fewer Americans died in that war than in WWI.\n\n&gt; I will be honest every day there will be less and less World War I veterans and one day there will be nobody left who was enlisted during that time period\n\nArmistice Day is it's about the war, not the veterans. It commemorates veterans and casualties alike. The idea that WWI should be forgotten simply because no one alive experienced it is terrifying to me - that's exactly why it needs a holiday.\n\n&gt; is a motion about looking back on our history. This, in my opinion, the first major international that affected the entire world that America took part in and obviously not be our last given our rise as a superpower.\n\nAgain, I think you're only proving my point. WWI wasn't a war about America's rise to power, and it shouldn't be treated as simply part of history. It was a horrific and avoidable waste of life. It should be remembered specifically for the purpose of avoiding any further wars."}, {"id": "clzx2t3", "body": "Veterans Day does not celebrate war.  The Concert for Valor is aiming to honor our veterans, not glorify or shine a positive light on the wars they fought in.  You mentioned some of the lineup; well there's Bruce Springsteen who has a decades-long history of protesting war, and Carrie Underwood who has sung about the loss of family members to war.  Eminem too has been highly critical of sending youth to war in his music.  \n\nThe concert itself is free, but on the event's website there is a long list of organizations to support which focus on veterans.  \n\nSure some people get carried away and turn what should be a day to honor veterans into more of a 4th of July-style celebration, but I've been a part of several Veterans Day ceremonies.  I've lain wreaths on the memorial.  I think for most people, any celebration on this day is done with the veterans in mind.  People go to restaurants and bars with their relatives who have made it back from war, or they honor their grandparents who fought overseas.  \n\nA fraction of people may bastardize the intent of the holiday, but that's true about nearly every holiday.  The birth of Christ has been turned into a two-month long festival of consumerism, and Martin Luthor King Jr.'s day has been turned into a day to sell cars and mattresses.  "}]}
