A rational conversation is a separate animal, and in most rational conversations I've ever seen atheists and the religious reach a point where they have no mutually accepted argument to use on one another; they each find the existence of God to be either probable or improbable and can't really go past that.  Once you realize you have no argument against what they're saying, you should just let it be.  Otherwise you're just yelling at things for no good reason.\n\n2) If you think it's worth jeopardizing your relationship with your father just to get him to stop believing something you disagree with, feel free to take that risk.

It is not my job to decide on a set of ideas that I think are right and abrade everyone I \"respect\" with them until we all accept the same ideas.

It's profoundly arrogant and inconsiderate to not only presume that you *must* be correct, but to continue pushing the argument against their will just because they can't convince you that you're wrong.  Imagine if I did that: if you and I were talking and I just kept badgering you about how you ought to be a Christian.  Would that be an effective or worthwhile use of my time or yours?

That's remarkably crass.\n\nIs it really \"tiptoeing\" to just *not insult something*?  This isn't an issue of people being unable to handle things you say; it's that the things you say are intentionally insulting.  I can handle insults pretty easily, that doesn't mean you should continue insulting me.  I don't see what purpose you're working towards other than trolling.\n\nIn any case, the original CMV was about how some atheists hurt science by being rude and off-putting.  Apply that to this conversation and you're essentially illustrating OP's point: you're baiting and being intentionally rude out of disrespect for me and my beliefs.  It's fine if you want to do that, but if you actually wanted to accomplish something positive with a religious person, I don't think this approach would work very well.

I'm calmly explaining to you why things are offensive in an effort to make you conscious of the way you affect others.  You apparently already know and just power right through common courtesy because...it's apparently interesting to you to observe the effects of being rude.\n\n&gt;I can respect a person without respecting a particular belief that they hold. And it's not like I default to respect for random people on the internet.\n\nYou can say you respect people all you want; if you intentionally do things that offer offense and insult to those people, then your version of respect is meaningless.  It's like saying \"I really like you\" while repeatedly spitting in their face.  And I generally thought that most people defaulted to respecting others until they'd been given a valid reason not to.  Color me crazy.\n\n&gt;In general, I think censoring oneself because someone might be offended is an insult to free speech.\n\nI think that really depends on the circumstances.  I think it would be wrong to tell some people what I actually thought of the guy in the coffin at a funeral.  I think it might be a good idea not to tell someone they look fat when it does them no good to hear it.  I think it would be wrong for me to tell my Muslim friends that I think their holy book is wrong because I know very well I can't prove that and saying what I think will serve no purpose other than causing conflict.\n\nI think all those things because free speech can't be insulted.  It's an idea that actually means we can say or not say what we want when we want to say it.  Moderation and silence are themselves contained within free speech, and it takes nothing away from free speech when I don't say whatever I feel like saying without respect for the effect I have on others.

We're talking about real, live people here, whose entire lives and passions do not revolve around formal logic, so here's a utility argument:\n\nTo take a well-worn example, Einstein was wrong about the state of the universe, not to mention, he himself was absolutely convinced that he was right. That doesn't mean we discard everything else Einstein contributed to physics (i.e. the entire foundation of modern physics) because he was wrong about that one thing. Similarly, even if you find some of religion's truth claims to be incorrect, or if you find some of religion's social history or current expression in society to be incorrect, doesn't mean you have to discard religion or be living a lie. You can be a Muslim feminist. You can be a Jew who mixes milk and meat. To suggest otherwise would be to employ an extremist view of religion, one that makes no space for what is arguably the centerpiece of the social and personal roles of religion: community creation and personal guidance. If a scientist enjoys being part of a religious community (as you find, once you go to college, that many scientists do), or needs the faith in a higher power to stay sane in her personal life (and that higher power doesn't have to be a bearded man in the sky - religions find god in many things, even monotheistic ones), that's okay and not unfaithful to their job. Or maybe you're a scientist who focuses on doing their research in enzyme behavior in bacterial evolution (so, you know, actual science, not what NDeT pretends is science on television), and you don't think about the bigger things too much. Science is a method, a paradigm, and a community, but it doesn't have to control your life. Especially since religion nowadays is such a personal thing that each of us not only has our own religion, but can practice it as he sees fit.\n\nThis may be a little postmodern, but I find that the scientific community is coming to the realization that the \"truth\" is not always absolute, and almost never useful to actual human life."}, {"id": "2msoba", "body": "I met a lot of atheists.

Their schools and teachers have completely failed to impart even the most rudimentary understanding of science, or equally likely they were prejudiced against science and reason by spiritual leaders in their community before teachers ever had a chance.\n\nAtheism is a poor scapegoat for the real cause of the public's lack of science literacy- the culture caused by organized religion which discourages free thought and questioning of our current understanding."}, {"id": "2msoba", "body": "I met a lot of atheists. I also met some angry atheists. My problem is with them. \n\nA lot of angry atheists attack religions and religious people by using science. A lot of them seem to think that they are helping scientific progress.\n\nI think they are doing the opposite. Scientific advancement is a group effort from the society. If more people take part in science, more progress is made.  The more the merrier.  \n\nBy using science to attack people who are religious, they alienate a huge population from science. So the number of people in science is lower. So less progress. More time until we get space ships.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I'm not sure anyone has actually convinced me to change my view thus far, though you've done well at arguing that what I'm talking about can't happen/is not a good idea for me to try/it's been shown that such an idea can't work. I think it's fair to say that a number of you convinced me that I'm being unrealistic and that I should just suck it up because any alternative in the vein of what I'm describing is going to be much worse. In other words, you've gotten me to agree at the practical level, but no one has yet convinced me at the theoretical level, though some of you have tried to argue that my question is flawed, and that the law of being a part of a social system is literally inviolable, like laws of physics, which I'm afraid I don't buy.**\n\nTo start, let me state that I'm not a libertarian, and I identify fairly strongly as a liberal. I also do not identify with any militia or secessionist movements, and I'm not anti-government per se. However, I am increasingly dissatisfied with society and the rules of society that I am bound to. I'm unhappy with our collective cultural values, the demands of the global economy, and of capitalism in general. All of this has led to to this series of thoughts.\n\nThere is much discussion on the topic of privacy relating to \"the right to be left alone.\" To me, that's just the right to not be annoyed. But let's talk about the right to be completely left alone-- the right to not deal with society at all, ever. In other words, do we, as humans, have the right from birth to not participate or be beholden to any social/national/economic/legal structure, AND the right to realistically act on that? I believe the answer is YES, and any answer other than YES, at least in the current state of the world, is basically an endorsement of human rights violations. Here is why.\n\nI was never asked to join this planet, nor was I asked which of many options of nationality to choose from (in fact, as a fully grown adult, I still can't freely choose this). I wasn't even asked whether I wanted to be a part of-- and thus tacitly approve of -- the whole nation-state structure that has been established. As it stands, I have no option but to agree to participate in the idea of nations, laws, global economies, currency, etc., which I am essentially coerced into doing by legal penalty, no matter where in the world I am. This is true because every habitable place on this planet has been claimed as \"property\" within the jurisdiction of some social structure, leaving me no place to physically inhabit without being subjected to another's rules/society/economy-- none of which I have any desire to participate in. I can on some practical level, opt out and live \"illegally\" on some land somewhere out of sight, but this cannot come with full peace of mind, as there will always be some looming threat of legal consequence to failure to comply with the laws of the territory I am living in (e.g. trespassing). \n\nBut wait, you might say, there's a workaround. You can buy a small piece of land and live there in isolation without ever dealing with society. But I don't think so. First of all, I have to participate in some economy I don't believe in before I can even buy that land. This means that I have to get a job, get a car, do all the things that make us all miserable, and participate in an economy I never asked to be a part of just so I can opt out! Then after that, I would have to pay property taxes on that land every year. Thus, I am continually forced back into participating in an economy that I want no part in just to pay for the land that I need to escape it. The way I read this is that even the \"workaround\" to the essential problem posed in the previous paragraph forces me to participate in all these systems before I can even exercise the right to leave, and then once I do exercise my right to leave, the structures still force me to be bound to it. In other words, I have no viable means of escape.  \n\n...which means that I am a slave, and my human rights are being continually violated. Change my view."}, {"id": "cm76shq", "body": "As your argument stands, the only way to exercise your own idea of property rights is to violate everyone else's.

And thus they want to stress that conflict, how there's no way for them to exercise their own rights.\n\nEven if you take a very conservative hard-line approach on not wanting to infringe on anyone else, you just want to leave everyone alone and go \"live in the jungle\" by yourself in peace, how do you do this?  If you can find somewhere that isn't explicitly owned by someone already, it may just get bought out from under you in the future.\n\nYou could say that this too is a part of brute survival, having to deal with finding an appropriate territory.  So it's certainly advantageous to enter into the social contract.\n\nBut the problem many people are finding is, entering into the system of living in a country, being on their books and being subject to their laws is no guarantee of getting any of the *benefits* of society.  Co-operative structures like governments and societies were presumably created so humans could have greater security, health, longevity, comfort, and stability compared to being out in the wild on their own.  But even in our modern world with more technology and wealth than ever before, people are left to fall through the cracks.\n\nTo actually enjoy the benefits and security of society, you need to endure constant cost-of-living expenses, and exert constant effort to meet those expenses.  But if too many things go wrong at once, and you become homeless, you may be constantly moved on, or have your very existence on the edges of the system criminalized.\n\nI agree with the benefits and stability of property rights in general, but somewhere we need to acknowledge that once virtually all the space and resources are claimed, we need to create or reserve a space or system for everyone else to have their minimum right to exist.\n\nI think rather than going out to live in the jungle, we should instead give people a basic income, so everyone is allotted a baseline minimum to secure at least those basic needs."}, {"id": "cm76shq", "body": "As your argument stands, the only way to exercise your own idea of property rights is to violate everyone else's.

To preface, my overall take is that it doesn't really make much sense to talk about your \"human rights\" outside the context of some kind of human society.\n\nImagine a post apocalyptic future where the surface is full of deadly radiation and the only way to survive is living in cramped dark caves eating mushrooms. Sucks, but would you say that the radiation is \"violating your human rights\"? Does it make sense to think about the right to \"opt out\" of the radiation?\n\nImagine living on an island full of man eating tigers. There's no spec of land that isn't some tiger's hunting ground. You live your life in constant fear of tigers. Are the tigers enslaving you? Should you be able to opt out of tigers? Its basically a request to opt-out of the food chain.\n\nImagine a similar island, but instead of tigers, there are human barbarians totally unaffiliated with any sort of nation. They take your food/supplies, hog the best fresh water sources, etc... In practice, are these barbarians really much different than the tigers? Why should they care about your rights or desire to opt out of the island's non-society?\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that all of the oppressive forces in these examples are basically just nature. Ultimately, when you look out at the real world, some kind of state just seems like human nature. You don't have to like it any more than you like radiation, tigers or barbarians. But that's what the world is, and a request to \"opt out\" seems as silly to me as opting out of any of the above scenarios. The only \"rights\" you really have are the ones that our civilization has invented. Everything else is just survival.

Change my view."}, {"id": "cm82psq", "body": "Ok so basically, I feel you. I've thought about this a lot. There are a lot of things that, just as organisms, we are thrust into with no options purely based on the circumstances and location of our birth. This is weird, but it's really always been this way. Only recently (from an evolutionary frame of reference) has it manifested in a societal way, with governments and laws and economies, etc. \n\nThink of it this way. Before civilization, you have the same basic problem. Everyone wants to survive, do their own thing and more or less be left alone. But how do we survive? As a cooperative species, we sometimes depend on one another to survive, even by accident. You're dying in the cold due to inadequate preparation. Another monkey man let's you stay in his private cave. Monkey man now expects something from you, so you give him some berries. This is a very basic exchange and it paves the way for an economy since there is some idea of what certain commodities are worth. \n\nFast forward to civilization with bartering but no currency. Trade some eggs for a cow. One cow is worth x amount of eggs. People do their own thing and seek help in areas they are lacking. Simple economy. I'm describing the idea of social order only from an economic standpoint. I'm also on mobile and tired so this might be sort of rambly and disorganized so bear with me. \n\nAnyway, you establish social order out of the desire to sustain yourself and survive. No one is born thinking \"I sure am excited to participate in a system of taxation, democratic representation and free market economy\" or whatever. It happens because in an ideal world, everyone would keep to themselves and not depend on anyone else for survival. But it's not ideal. Some people are stronger or weaker than others. Some of the strong want to harm the weak, so there are institutions in place to protect them. Some of the strong want to help the weak rather than ignore them, so institutions exist to promote cooperation. \n\nSociety arises from chaos, to master the wilds of complex life. Society is the attempt to restrain those like you who would, and did, go out into the world and claim a part of it as their own and make their own rules. To restrain them from taking too much for everyone to have a little bit. So there are patches of land everyone can live in and exist under usually fair rules in order to simulate the idea of what everyone would have in an ideal world. \n\nTL;DR society is a construct that does it's best to give us survival and freedom, and all the good that comes with it while protecting us from the lawlessness and negativity of having everything already claimed or getting what we have taken from us. \n\nIdk if any of that made sense but I'm sure I took the most roundabout way of explaining it possible. \n\nEdit: a question that might work better than all that mess at exposing the flaws in your idea. \n\nWhat if everyone did what you were saying? Who prevents them from taking too much and leaving nothing for everyone else? Who decides how much they can do, or prevents them from harming and taking from other people? If everyone does it, it's survival of the fittest and life gets REAL BAD REAL FAST"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2ms1rh", "body": "America has participated in almost every Middle Eastern conflict in the past 20 or so years.

The more recent conflicts since WWII have been primarily to position it's self as the world super power. This would be the cold war period where it was constantly countering the soviets. \n\nOnce the end of the Cold War came in the early 90's you saw 2 things, 1. The United States shifting it's attention from competing to be a world super power to defending it's super power position and 2. expanding it. This expansion was seen primarily in the 2nd Iraq war where they not only were interested in securing vital resources like oil but replacing soviet style governments and hoping to spread it's own political/economic systems to the Middle East. \n\nSo you have the realist theory of hegemony which I just argued. There is also a Marxist analysis of US foreign affairs I think is also worth mentioning. Basically the theory goes is that for a capitalist system to thrive it must open new markets to secure cheap labor and affordable resources. Considering that the US is the center of capitalism and globalization it's absolutely necessary to have a large military in order to protect it's global economic investments.\n\nPersonally I think both theories together do a good job of analyzing US foreign policy and an ability to predict with generalities what the US will do next. For example, we know it will maintain it's military dominance no matter what because this protects it's global economy and drives it's industry. If a threat antagonizes it or threatens it's position as super power it will go to war, if a state threatens it's economic resources like oil it will move to secure that. \n\nI think this also explains very well why the United States doesn't simply abandon most if it's military spending and use it to rebuild infrastructure, research and development etc. Etc. All capable of creating jobs and even more productivity, which if your theory was correct would be it's course of action.\n"}, {"id": "2ms1rh", "body": "America has participated in almost every Middle Eastern conflict in the past 20 or so years.

Obviously this isn't a problem that will be solved solely by throwing money at it, but should be coupled with real educational reform (another discussion altogether). \n\nSure many of these points are contentious issues, depending on your political leanings, but the point is that there are better things to spend money on that would actually bootstrap a struggling economy.\n\nSome in this thread have said that military spending doesn't necessarily lead to war. Even if that's true, a stockpile of the latest in weapons technology is not an investment. It's pouring money down the drain."}, {"id": "cm7juwh", "body": "The reason is because the military both produces technology, maintains a force unprecedented historically, and enables the security of our interconnected global economies.

Granted, foreign policy is not my field, but if this were the case it seems that if anything arose that were truly a threat to the vast network of western economies, then it's in the interests of every part of the network to fend off the threat, not just the United States.

Remember we are producing enough extra food now to feed a couple billion additional people. We aren't even using anywhere close to available arable farmland or utilizing new urban farming techniques on a wide scale.

There is significant hunger in poor areas now, but that has nothing to do with the global availability of food and way more to do with the fact that governments are too busy keeping food away from supporters of their rivals than securing food supply. I imagine that if food security became an issue we would find that we have way more ability to feed people than we expect.\n\nOPEC is losing market share. They didn't vote to cut back production to raise the price because they don't have the capacity to cut back that much. Iran, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia are all losing money on every barrel of oil sold on these prices. How can OPEC starve out the shale oil industry when the shale oil is less expensive than OPEC oil?

Therefore I will address the China article for a conciser and more relevant comment. My thesis is that such articles are fearmongering, shitty journalism, and you shouldn't read and especially disseminate them.\n\nFirst of all, it's extremely biased to assume global non-renewables reserves are proportionally anywhere near as exhausted as China's. China has a &gt;1.5 billion population (that's 20% of the entire world!), has experienced 12% growth for a decade, and starting with a moderately industrialized economy, and is the biggest manufacturing hub of the world. *Of course its natural resources are depleted*. It's a huge problem for China's economy, which is why the Chinese are capping extraction, importing more from abroad, and colonializing Africa. China is also releasing I believe 40% of the world's manufactured carbon, so it's not a good situation by any means. But it's not a Biblical disaster. \n\nThe second thing is that 25 years is a huge timeframe. 25 years ago we just got internet, the Soviet Union was still around, and China was still mostly surviving on paddy fields. In the next 25 China is likely to switch away from resource-intenstive production to more specialized, hence environmentally friendly manufacturing, because wages have risen so much that it's no longer profitable to dump the dirties, cheapest shit in China. Plus, considering how much money is invested into new technology research (incl. by China), we might very well have substitutes for most precious minerals by 2040.\n\nFinally, the economy doesn't stand still either. This statistic is based on projecting *current production rate* TWENTY FIVE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. I can 100% guarantee you, the current production rate will not be the same next year, much less 25 years from today. It's absolutely ludicrous to project things this far on, because a change in technology, exchange rates, interest rates, global markets, political instability, whatever (all of which are very likely to happen in the next 25 years) will alter that production rate, and we don't know where or by how much (it's reasonably possible to build a predictive model, but it will be a range of values and probabilities, and won't sound as good in the title of an article).\n\nSo, don't take what you read at face value."}, {"id": "2mr725", "body": "Our civilization today is almost entirely dependent on petroleum for energy, materials and the sheer scale in which we operate.

As others in this thread have pointed out, many resources can be substituted or supplemented. For instance, petroleum for energy can be replaced with solar and wind. Economic forces would counter-act the worst parts of resource depletion in those instances. Water, however, is absolutely necessary. The earth is covered in the stuff, absolutely replete with it, but only a tiny fraction of that is usable.\n\nConsider the following hypothetical: Middle America produces an enormous amount of the earth's grain. Much of that grain is produced using irrigation from underground water supplies. Many areas in the \"bread basket\" are 50 years from serious exhaustion of their fresh water supplies. When the wells dry up, the crops die, and the people move. The population and crop production continue to get pushed to tighter and tighter confines. Food becomes more expensive, water becomes less available to the population, riots...war...yada yada yada...the collapse of civilization. \n\nWater can be piped, cleaned, irrigated, desalinated, etc. But all of those processes cost resources. Water is, on a survival level, more critical than any of those resources. But since water is critical to survival, increasing the cost to deliver clean usable water comes with all sorts of nasty consequences. The most obvious that I can think of now is that it will drive up the cost of food production. Add an expanding population (more mouths that need food, and fewer food resources) and you have a recipe for the break down of civil society. That's before we start fighting over drinking water.

If the oil runs out, we will have nothing- no feasible backup source of energy, nothing to build today's miracle materials like plastics and composites with.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal#World_coal_reserves\n\nThe oil usage today in roughly 90 MMbd (million of barrels of oil per day), compared to 51 MMbd from natural gas and 58 MMbd from coal - therefore most of our fossil energy does not depend on petroleum. And adjusted for renewable (including hydro, one of our largest sources of electricity)/nuclear, oil provides less than 40% of our energy needs. Our civillization today is therefore not dependent on oil as the driving force of our economy. As for there being no viable replacement: the current world reserves of coal are 4,196 billion barrels of oil equivalent, this could supply the equivalent of 58 YEARS of human energy consumption - after oil and natural gas have completely been used up. Therefore fossil energy has viable reserves that will last over 100 years. Assuming that economics works in the favor of wind/solar pv/solar thermal concentrated/solar thermal pond/tidal/wave/nuclear fission/nuclear fusion/large scale hydro/small scale hydro/pumped storage hydro/biomass/geothermal, then the necessary carbon for manufacturing of plastics may come from remaining petroleum/coal/natural gas (which will then last us hundreds millions of years). We have no shortage of alternatives.\n\nThe most important commodity of humanity is in fact not oil, it is metal ores, and their refined forms. Aluminium production globally is powered by hydropower - the largest source of electricity in the early 20th century (to prove that it's commercially viable), it does not depend on oil except for a few small smelters (some may be fueled by natural gas - but their aluminium costs more than that from hydropower). The largest of all metal ores is obviously iron ore - which is currently refined using coking coal **not oil**. Also, our current civilization does not depend on miracle materials - they are reserved for a civilization of the future.\n\n&gt;Rare earth metals will run out within 20 years. Significant parts of our technology are based on rare earths, and like petroleum, we have no alternatives.\n\nThat is assuming no alternate source of rare earth elements is available - China's might run out in 20 years - but they have an estimated 23% of the worlds reserves. So that gives us 80 years to play around with (which is much longer than the 50 years until collapse that you suggest). The decommissioning of mines is also no quick process - they are brownfield sites usually. This means that in most jurisdictions (including China's) they would have to give 1-3 years of notice - enough time for the market to react (as they know exactly what tonnage will not be placed on the market which they assumed would). This would push the prices up - making it viable for other mines to open.\n\nThese factors make it almost impossible for us to be caught unprepared - a weaning of of dependent resources could take well over 50 years, and civilization would not collapse as people know what is occurring, and what is being done to eliminate need in accordance with economic principles. The market can predict what will happen - so a recession will not occur! Our resources will not run out before we can react! There will be no collapse of civilization as we know it.\n\nSorry for my ramblings.

Significant parts of our technology are based on rare earths, and like petroleum, we have no alternatives.\n\nWith the increasing connections and interconnections that are essential for our survival, the failure of a few links would not be very significant. However, if multiple catastrophes that affect different levels of the supply chain due to different reasons occur together, the results will be disastrous. One of the examples I read about says that if China gets really screwed up and stops rare earth metals supply to the outside world( they account for 95% of the production), we will suddenly have a electronics production shortage. If that happens to combine with a petroleum supply issue, we will have a major economic disaster. Of course, this might be simplifying a lot of issues, but my core issue still stands: if a perfect storm of problems happen, we are screwed.\n\nWe have had massive civil unrest and economic problems like the Great Depression for far smaller issues.
