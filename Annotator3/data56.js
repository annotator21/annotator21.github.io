I don't think it's reasonable at all to suggest that such a judgement could have been made at the time. Were the United States somehow able to see thirty years into the future? To justify military action on ethical or moral grounds retroactively like that, based on the status decades after the fact, is basically saying that any military action at all would be just, because chances are it could lead to a positive outcome eventually."}, {"id": "cm0mwak", "body": "You mentioned it yourself - the nature of the regime from the start was counter to the very ideals of the US from the beginning.

The regime the United States supported was not truly democratic and did not protect personal liberty or human rights, these factors only emerged three decades later and the United States had absolutely no basis to ground the idea that they would.\n\nSimply being anti-Communist shouldn't be sufficient in itself, do you also think it was just for the United States to support the coup in Chile that ousted a democratically elected government in favour of the dictator Pinochet, or the slaughter of somewhere between 500,000 - 1 million civilians in Indonesia in 1965 to protect a non-democratic military junta? These were explicitly anti-Communist actions, so where do you draw the line? \n\nAgain, you can claim it was justified to protect U.S. interests by defending a U.S. ally, but that's a very different claim than stating that the war was *just*. Simply being a U.S. ally doesn't actually mean they support or protect the *ideals* of the U.S., just that they are useful strategically from a geopolitical perspective. Being an American ally doesn't mean that Saudi Arabia share these ideals, they're a backward theocracy with no interest in the protection of human rights or personal liberty. \n\nYes, the United States did stick around and support the reforms that gave rise to the flourishing liberal democracy South Korea is today - but they also stuck around and supported decades of the worst offences to human rights and democracy in the region. In 1950-1952 there were absolutely no indicators that South Korea would be conductive to high development or a liberal democracy, it took three decades for these to become relevant factors. Again, could the United States somehow see 30 years into the future? \n\nThe U.S. was absolutely willing to support South Korea wholeheartedly even when the regime was characterised by the suppression of dissent, censorship of the press, and erosion of democratic process. Democratic reforms only came about due to mass protest movements from the Korean people. If these did not take place, I don't doubt that the United States would continue to support an illiberal regime in South Korea.\n\nAgain, you might justify the war on realpolitik grounds, and you'd have a leg to stand on - but that's a *very* different claim from asserting that it was a just war.\n\n"}, {"id": "2lzl18", "body": "It's Veteran's day and everyone is saying that we need to honor our troops.

First, if the owner is not convicted of a crime, she should not be punished.  Taking her property does hurt her, and should count as punishment.\n\nSecond, the fact that prosecutors and police profit from enforcement is deeply problematic.  This creates a large financial incentive to punish people regardless of justice.  This problem could be fixed by requiring all proceeds to go to the IRS or some other unpopular fund; the other problems would remain.\n\nThird, the seizures are typically directed at poor people and minorities, and are therefore pretty regressive.\n\nFourth, the seizures can be used to subvert state law: if a state has legalized marijuana (or any other substance that is illegal on the Federal level), that state's police ought not to cooperate in the prosecution of citizens who violate the Federal law.  Yet with \"equitable sharing\", the state police can seize the property of a marijuana user, give a 20+% cut to the DOJ, and keep the rest.\n\nObviously I realize evidence must be seized before a conviction; it should be returned to the owner whenever the case is closed, however."}, {"id": "clzgz6m", "body": "So I actually put up a CMV on [this exact topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2iy7ai/cmv_civil_asset_forfeiture_should_be_abolished/) about a month ago.

So the case made is that when the government just wants to go after property, it should be able to do so in a civil proceeding, like anyone else who wants to go after only property does."}, {"id": "cm097xv", "body": "I know you're only trying to defend a position you may not actually hold, but the statement that the civil asset forfeiture is not alien or abnormal is incorrect. Further, it's a blatant violation of the Due Process clause:\n\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause\n\n\nTo begin, in cases where the property owner has not been charged or not been found guilty, this is absolutely an admission on the part of the state that the evidence does not meet the required burden of proof to convict the property owner.\n\nIn order to circumvent this lack of evidence of guilt, the state seeks to seize assets from the citizen, thereby issuing a punitive damage to the property owner, a punishment for a crime they cannot prove, and often for which the property owner was quite obviously not engaged, complicit, or guilty of.\n\nThey do this via the legal fiction of litigation against the property, and assert this satisfies due process, but how could it? Frequently no litigation or legal proceedings are ever filed against the property owner, so there is clearly no way the government could be meeting the requirement of Due Process when depriving him of said property.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture in America is one of the more powerful illuminators of the decline of Liberty, Justice, and Free Society in America. In a free society, property rights are given great weight, they underpin the theoretical foundations of the formation of the Unites States itself.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture would never have reached the level it is at in the United States if it were a functioning free state. It is blatantly contrary to a majority of the political theory that would become some of the most important and cherished values and ideals of this nation and its people, but lately, we seem to have forgotten."}, {"id": "2lz3a0", "body": "Civil asset forfeiture occurs when police seize some property even when the owner has not been convicted of any crime.

First, if the owner is not convicted of a crime, she should not be punished.  Taking her property does hurt her, and should count as punishment.\n\nSecond, the fact that prosecutors and police profit from enforcement is deeply problematic.  This creates a large financial incentive to punish people regardless of justice.

You can be be found guilty in criminal, but found at no fault in civil(although it is rare), or found not guilty(which is **DIFFERENT** than *innocent*) in criminal court, and be found at fault or liable in civil court. This is due to a differing standard on burden of proof between the two. As you most likely know, criminal proceedings require \"Beyond a reasonable doubt\" which is the second highest standard(behind absolute certainty/beyond the shadow of a doubt). Civil courts generally require the level \"clear and convincing evidence\"(preponderance of evidence is also used in fmaily court and few other places). The difference between the two is that while beyond a reasonable doubt requires the ruling out of other possibilities(e.g. another person committed the crime), Clear and convincing simply requires the evidence to pretty much say \"yea they did this\". You can read more about the differing standards [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof).\n\nSo where does this come into play? Well you have to remember that criminal and civil are for the most part separate, and that while generally civil proceedings begin after the settling of criminal proceeding they can happen simultaneously. But that really isn't the problem. You must remember that a criminal case can be lost for any number of reasons, such as having a poor chain of custody on evidence, hostile witnesses recanting, improper procedures on the part of the DA, the list is endless. Just because the case was lost in criminal court due to some evidentiary/procedural mistake or lack of meeting the burden of proof **DOES NOT MEAN** it doesn't meet the standards of civil forfeiture in civil court at the *lower* standards.\n\nA good example is the following: A street level supplier(SLS) gets arrested,  and the case is predicated originally on the street level dealer(SLD) flipping, and further predicated by controlled buys through the SLD from the SLS under the supervision of LEOs. During the investigation the LEOs working the case get a copy of the finances for the SLS and find that SLS has not held an actual job in 4 years, yet he has a new car, a house with 60\" TVs in every room, every current generation consoles with hundreds of games, and tens of thousands of dollars in jewellery and clothes. Through the course of the investigation you figure out what the SLS's cut is, and as a result can use that to show his income is solely from the selling of illegal narcotics. During trial a procedural error on the part of the DA means the case against the SLS must be dismissed, but the *evidence* of *financial gain through illegal acts* is still there. So they use it in civil court to seize the assets since they can ***PROVE*** they were ill-gotten. \n\nAnother use of the civil forfeiture is to get at the *top* of the criminal organizations. As you can guess those at the top are far removed from the actual distribution of the narcotics, so it is very difficult to actually get them in jail unless they are dumb. But you can show that they are directly profiting from the lower level dealings, and as a result seize their stuff which can lead to [RICO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act). \n\n&gt; Second, the fact that prosecutors and police profit from enforcement is deeply problematic.

This is not true.  80% of the people whose property is seized under civil law are never even charged with a crime according to one study of over 500 federal cases by the Pittsburgh Press.  80% of civil forfeitures are not against known criminals. \n\nEach state has a different standard of proof for the owner of seized property and 10 states only require probable cause!  However in most states the (former) owner must prove they are innocent in order to get their property back.\n\nThe government/police also only has to suspect that the property is being used in connection with some activity that is either illegal or claimed to be illegal. The government sues the property, not the owner, and it is then up to the former owner to prove that the property was not used illegally. The former owner then has to pay a nonrefundable bond of 10 percent of the value of the property and pay attorney fees that can amount to up to $100,000. And if the government thinks the money you use to pay your lawyer is also tainted, it can seize that too, so it can become impossible to hire a lawyer.  \n\nSo we know that property can be seized by simple suspicion, the owner must prove their innocence to get it back, there is a financial incentive to seize property, it is possible for the ones who seized property to force the owner not to have legal representation, 80% of forfeiture's are not against a known criminal, oh and detailed statistics are not required to be collected.

The point about the public not wanting to pay more tax money is valid, but bandaging it with a framework so susceptible to injustice just creates a new problem for the public."}, {"id": "clzqpj0", "body": "LEO here, I have some insight into this. The cases of \"seized some poor mother's car and $2000 cash just because\" are a very statistically small percentage of all civil asset forfeiture cases. The vast majority are good, and I'll attempt to show how things happen, and why a *criminal* conviction isn't necessary.\n\nOkay, so basically our legal system is split into two branches somewhat not completely separate systems, criminal(substantive law, procedural law) and civil (torts, etc). You can be be found guilty in criminal, but found at no fault in civil(although it is rare), or found not guilty(which is **DIFFERENT** than *innocent*) in criminal court, and be found at fault or liable in civil court. This is due to a differing standard on burden of proof between the two. As you most likely know, criminal proceedings require \"Beyond a reasonable doubt\" which is the second highest standard(behind absolute certainty/beyond the shadow of a doubt). Civil courts generally require the level \"clear and convincing evidence\"(preponderance of evidence is also used in fmaily court and few other places). The difference between the two is that while beyond a reasonable doubt requires the ruling out of other possibilities(e.g. another person committed the crime), Clear and convincing simply requires the evidence to pretty much say \"yea they did this\". You can read more about the differing standards [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof).\n\nSo where does this come into play? Well you have to remember that criminal and civil are for the most part separate, and that while generally civil proceedings begin after the settling of criminal proceeding they can happen simultaneously. But that really isn't the problem. You must remember that a criminal case can be lost for any number of reasons, such as having a poor chain of custody on evidence, hostile witnesses recanting, improper procedures on the part of the DA, the list is endless. Just because the case was lost in criminal court due to some evidentiary/procedural mistake or lack of meeting the burden of proof **DOES NOT MEAN** it doesn't meet the standards of civil forfeiture in civil court at the *lower* standards.\n\nA good example is the following: A street level supplier(SLS) gets arrested,  and the case is predicated originally on the street level dealer(SLD) flipping, and further predicated by controlled buys through the SLD from the SLS under the supervision of LEOs. During the investigation the LEOs working the case get a copy of the finances for the SLS and find that SLS has not held an actual job in 4 years, yet he has a new car, a house with 60\" TVs in every room, every current generation consoles with hundreds of games, and tens of thousands of dollars in jewellery and clothes. Through the course of the investigation you figure out what the SLS's cut is, and as a result can use that to show his income is solely from the selling of illegal narcotics. During trial a procedural error on the part of the DA means the case against the SLS must be dismissed, but the *evidence* of *financial gain through illegal acts* is still there. So they use it in civil court to seize the assets since they can ***PROVE*** they were ill-gotten. \n\nAnother use of the civil forfeiture is to get at the *top* of the criminal organizations. As you can guess those at the top are far removed from the actual distribution of the narcotics, so it is very difficult to actually get them in jail unless they are dumb. But you can show that they are directly profiting from the lower level dealings, and as a result seize their stuff which can lead to [RICO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act). \n\n&gt; Second, the fact that prosecutors and police profit from enforcement is deeply problematic. This creates a large financial incentive to punish people regardless of justice. \n\nI'm sure your local police agency publishes their budget, I invite you to go look at it and see how much of their funding is from drug/asset seizure and compare it to what they are provided by taxes. If your local department is of a decent size you'll be surprised just how much of their operating budget is based off seizures. Now I know this sounds like I'm siding with you, I'm not. Many agencies use this money to actually be able to get by without the public all up in their shit about not doing their jobs. The city where I am at funds both of their helicopters, the pilot's salaries, the maintenance, and several other smaller departments off  seizures. Without that money they would not be able to provide those services to the citizens. This also reduces the burden of taxation off the citizens, because lets face it, everyone wants more police presence, faster response times, and better training, but don't want to pay for it, shit they often want to pay less.\n\n &gt; Third, the seizures are typically directed at poor people and minorities, and are therefore pretty regressive.\n\nThey aren't \"directed at poor people\", it is simply that poor people are typically the ones out there slinging drugs. Your old school money people typically aren't gonna risk all their shit to push some dope."}, {"id": "cm0f8kl", "body": "I want to ask more about why you think the civil standard is the appropriate one, as opposed to using the criminal forfeiture standard.  In the case of the street level supplier you give, why can't you seize his stuff, and once a plea or guilty verdict is reached, forfeit it under criminal forfeiture?\n\nI am sure it is a lot easier to bring the case in civil court, but why should I think that's a good thing?  I don't particularly want the government to be able to punish people if it can't prove its case in a criminal court.  I'm not sure what you mean when you say a procedural error by the DA can kill the case?  Normally, to have an indictment dismissed with prejudice the DA would have had to do something that violated the defendant's constitutional rights, like a *Brady* violation.\n\nAs to the RICO example: RICO statutes (at leas the ones I'm somewhat familiar with: federal and NY) are criminal statutes that also let you charge the bosses.  So again, why not charge them and forfeit their stuff after getting a conviction/plea?\n\n&gt;I'm sure your local police agency publishes their budget, I invite you to go look at it and see how much of their funding is from drug/asset seizure and compare it to what they are provided by taxes.

The first person does actually breach a contract with it, and thus doing something wrong. However later clients in the chain are not breaking any contract.\n\nAlice buys a book and offers Bob to photocopy a few pages. Alice is doing something wrong, because the EULA of books is to not do this, so a contract is broken. Bob does not do anything wrong, he merely accepts a voluntary offer by the legal owner of that copy. \n\nSo, the contract Alice signed by purchasing a book is not binding for Bob, this is the aspect you miss."}, {"id": "clzzoxw", "body": "Inventory?\n\nMedia isn't a physical item, so the terminology needs updating. \n\nOwners are taking a loss in sales.

I have seen a few cases where it's a bit worse in industries without clear-cut laws. Near Halloween, there was a redditor who had their design taken, replicated without any adjustments, and sold as their original idea. But the redditor was unable to take action against it. In this situation, who do you think is at fault? It's not really black or white in this situation. The company used their own materials to produce a copy that just looks incredibly similar.\n\nBut when you pirate a movie, or music, or copy pages from the book, you're creating your own edition that has the same movie stars, the same voice, and the same words by the writer. It's as if you bought it, but you didn't really buy it. The risk factor of downloading viruses and malware is much less significant if you go for trusted seeders, scan your files before opening, create system backups, etc. to workaround that, and does not justify your actions in piracy either. You can't justify actions by saying risks were involved and it might've been worse for everyone.\n\n&gt;Yes this is my opinion. I know for a fact that I would spend substantially more on music than I do now. I don't think I am the only one in that boat.\n\nDefinitely, but it's doubtful that everyone's in that boat. You can't say with a 100% certainty that the majority of people share the same opinion as you, that they will stop pirating once the price goes down. Even if they do, each person will have a different value for how long it must be priced at before they buy the movie, or the next Taylor Swift album. Pricing it cheaper may or may not be advantageous to the artist and producer. It's not possible to change your view to think that it can't happen, because it could. However, because it's not the only possible outcome, it weakens your argument for why pirating media due to their prices is fine.\n\nAnd say the prices did fall down, and less people are pirating, and they're all buying the music with a tap. Who are the creators that will still survive? The mainstream ones. They can take the hit and still make a comfortable amount of money in the very worst case scenario. For those who aren't as popular, marketing their product won't keep them around for long. They weren't popular to begin with, and it wasn't necessarily the issue of pricing that's slowing their rise to fame. Maybe it's the lack of marketing, which they can't do because they don't have money. We can't keep them at the regular price, because if we're already pirating mainstream stuff, we might as pirate the non-mainstream stuff as well. Because hey, I could grab a Katy Perry song for $0.10, but this lesser known alternative band is selling their single for $2.00? I'm already adjusted to the low price of mainstream, so I'm not paying for the latter unless it's also \"reasonably\" priced."}, {"id": "clz5465", "body": "Your touching on my point.

This I believe is wrong. \n\nIf I had a need for a physical item I would see what was available on the market. If nothing on the market was available at a reasonable price I might consider making it for myself. Companies who manufacture are able to mass produce goods for cheaper than an individual could because they have equipment available which would be cost prohibitive for an individual to acquire. This means that usually an item can be purchased cheaper than it could be produced at home. If I needed a new computer there is no way I could manufacture one as cheaply as easily as I could buy one so I am happy to purchase one.\n\nI am not from the US but I know you have some very restrictive patent laws which aren\u2019t consistent with much of world. Most places allow patents to be infringed for personal non-commercial use. I can build a Boeing 747 in my shed for personal use but I can\u2019t burn a CD. The music industry sells CDs for a huge profit on what they actually cost to produce. Because of the huge mark-up people adopt a DIY attitude. Then rather than reduce price like another industry might, the music industry protects its sales by getting unfair laws passed forcing people to buy their product. \n\nDistributing music over the internet should be even cheaper than CD\u2019s but it is still prohibitively expensive. I just opened the iTunes store on my phone and clicked the first album, Sonic Highways. $16.99 for the album or $2.19 for a single song.\n\nThe music industry has brought piracy on itself. It could have embraced the internet as a means of supplying music for a reasonable cost but it didn\u2019t. I believe if the music industry lowered the price on music to ~ $1 per album or $0.10 per song very few people would pirate music. They would make less per download but sell much more music. It wouldn\u2019t be worth downloading crappy unorganised bits of music mixed with malware and viruses, or spend weeks trying to find something obscure. Not to mention as people left piracy and started paying for music seeders would start to disappear. I would pay for all my music, in fact I would spend more on music than I do now, most people would.  I would be much more likely to spend money on music I hadn\u2019t heard before or wanted to try. \n"}, {"id": "clz3zcg", "body": "Sure, piracy isn't the same as stealing, but that doesn't mean you should be allowed to do it.\n\nLook, you like music.

But. First of all by externality it suggests you are doing economic analysis. The issue is the really good artists are not really mercenary. They play music or write because it would kill them not to, the creative fire is burning and needs letting out. Money plays the role of enabling them to do it and not have to have a job to pay bills, it does not play the role of motivating.\n\nWhen we put too much money in the system, we tend to motivate the mercenary types. Actually not even the artists, but the managers of big labels who manufacture crappy plastic stars. \n\nThis actually turns the normal motivation logic the other way around.

Because the best have some internal fire they need to express, the worst are just looking for easy living.\n\nI totally agree that pirating Minay does not help the independent artists.

We talk with out friends on Facebook etc. I would find it totally OK if musicians would make a living of mainly performing on stage and people would go to venues, instead of making a living out of people listening to CDs or legal downloads at home. The history of music is old as fuck, record selling started with some phonographs around 1880's but basically it did not even become really that big until the Beatles. \n\nSo why do we have to see record selling as the main source of revenue for musicians, and record buying as the main way of enjoying music?\n\nWhy not see a record as more of a demo, and then go to venues?\n\nAgain it is not hard to do... release 2-4 songs free, 30 mins of others and then tell people to get your ass to the club if you want more, or, more like, lobby your local venue owner to invite the band."}, {"id": "clza6ka", "body": "This is a better argument than most here, at least you understand the difference between stealing and copying. \n\nEssentially what you are saying is that unlike stealing, copying does not violate an ethical principle or natural right, it still violates a utilitarian social agreement.\n\nThis is actually arguable.

So when you pirate an album, the artist, producers, record company, etc. have just lost the income guaranteed to them by their patent even though you have acquire their goods. If everyone could pirate music legally it would be extremely difficult for artists to earn any kind of profit. \n\nIn regards to the incredible markups on music, I don't disagree with your perspective, but your ultimate conclusion is, at the very least, highly exaggerated. If the record companies decided to start selling music for $1 per album instead of, lets just assume an industry average of $10 (it is likely higher), then they would need to sell 10 TIMES the number of albums in order to simply break even. This is impractical seeing as at the end of the day many people would probably still opt to pirate the album for free rather than pay for it. Seeing as overall album sales aren't close to the relevance of profit, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a financial standpoint for the record companies to lower their prices like this. Clearly, as they are still charging such outrageous prices, there is still a demand for albums even at these prices.
