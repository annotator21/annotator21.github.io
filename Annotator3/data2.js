Having a harsh, controlling father keeps children from developing the ability to regulate themselves, from internalizing their own intentions and then learning to act on them. Procrastination can even be a form of rebellion, one of the few forms available under such circumstances. What's more, under those household conditions, procrastinators turn more to friends than to parents for support, and their friends may reinforce procrastination because they tend to be tolerant of their excuses.\n\nand \n&gt;Procrastinators can change their behavior\u2014but doing so consumes a lot of psychic energy. And it doesn't necessarily mean one feels transformed internally. It can be done with highly structured cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nSo while the blame for procrastinating ultimately comes down to the person doing it, distilling it down to \"procrastinators fail because they are lazy, and I succeed because I work hard\" is false because they have to overcome a lifetime of bad conditioning."}, {"id": "2nvoj9", "body": "I don't think that there's such a thing as laziness, on its own -- I think the word can be used to describe behaviors, but those behaviors always have more complex underlying mechanics (examples below) and it's always more useful to approach the behaviors from the perspectives of those mechanics than from the perspective of laziness -- unless your only goal is to be hostile to the person whose behavior you're describing.\n\nLaziness can be:\n\n* Depression -- sometimes people are just psychologically/emotionally incapable of motivating themselves to do a thing that they want to do.\n* Fear of failure.\n* Bad faith -- sometimes people don't want to do a thing because it conflicts with their goals, but aren't being honest with what their goals are.\n* Indecision -- like bad faith, sometimes people have multiple conflicting goals and avoid taking action that would definitively establish a choice.\n* Hostility -- sometimes people don't do things that would benefit them because they would also benefit someone else, from whom they want to withhold that benefit.\n\nThere are more, those were just some examples.\n\nThe word 'laziness' could defensibly be used to describe any of those rationales.

I'm not arguing that when people say it, they are failing to convey any meaning. \n\nI'm arguing that the word \"lazy\" reliably subverts efforts to appreciate the role that motive and circumstance play in decision making. \n\nBtw, and this is totally a nitpick so feel free to ignore it, but the history of life has definitely not been **entirely** shaped by creatures maximizing the amount of food and sex they can get. Lots of creatures undermine their ability to get food to optimize for sex, or undermine their ability to get sex to optimize for food, and that's not even accounting for the like-a-billion years of nothing but things that reproduce asexually, or all of the ways that species pursue goals outside those two, in order to optimize for some third element.

There are also two important reasons for that:\n\n* Any argument *for* affirmative actions should be scientific rather than political and that it should be based on the program's actual results and efficiency. Therefore since it is rather obvious that it doesn't work as a general principle changing the criteria of allocation of resources is illogical and pointless because it doesn't address the causes of the program's failure. It just changes the political constituency which benefits.\n\n* In America in particular there is high enough correlation between poverty and race that changing the criteria from \"black\" to \"poor\" is really no significant change at all other than expanding it to other impoverished communities which will make the program even more unmanageable and problematic.\n\nBelow the edited original post:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I am a European so I am free from certain cultural bias that Americans share - that is to say I am not racist because I don't approve of welfare for blacks. I am also fairly well acquainted with American politics and history so I do know what happened.  I also studied economics - and even taught it for a time -  so I do have the knowledge which helps solving socio-economic issues in a scientific way without resorting to overt politics.\n\nAffirmative action is a program which works along the rules of **zero-sum game** within a given demographics by assigning higher priority in access to resources to some individuals *at the expense of others*. It is not a program which works by increasing the *total* pool of available resources but just re-assigns who gets to use them within the same initial parameters. It also typically works from the bottom up which means that it is the *least* advantageous people who get thrown off the lists to make space for the privileged ones. It is therefore deeply unethical in terms of an egalitarian approach in a society.\n\nTechnically speaking affirmative action should not be implemented at all for any purposes *if you really care about long-lasting effects*. There is a whole lot of economic and psychological reasons why it doesn't work, is a waste of resources and works often to the detriment of society. As a matter of fact in terms of society-wide effects understood in net terms and without racial bias there is *no* evidence that it works other than the obvious fact of special treatment for black and other minority individuals - which is a political criterion not a scientific one.\n\nIt is important to understand that there is a difference between affirmative action understood as a political slogan (as Obamacare or example) and the actual program classified in actual economic terms. In political terms affirmative action includes *all* programs aimed to help the blacks. In economic terms it only includes *selective welfare and preferential treatment* and should be treated distinctly from other general-purpose welfare programs.\n\nAffirmative action works by lowering standards for performance for selected individuals whenever taken into consideration for a job, place in a school, access to resources, welfare or government grants or any other similar situation. It works under the assumption that rather than do something to help improve the results it is better to adjusts the thresholds so as to low-performing individuals will not be rejected.  It does nothing to address the causes of the low performance of said ethnic groups - that is the purpose of selective welfare or welfare in general. As a matter of fact affirmative action results in the direct opposite - by removing incentives for self-improvement, increased discipline, adjusting your plans to realistic options in the future etc.\n\nThe best evidence for the lack of results is the comparison for two culturally  distinct ethnicities in America - Black and Asian. Blacks were the main (or even *only* ) recipient of affirmative action aid while Asians largely made do on their own. The result (cultural factors aside) Blacks as a group are entirely dependent on welfare and government help and suffer disproportionately from any adverse activity (like the \"not racist at all\" war on drugs) while Asians constitute the most educated and highest earning demographic.\n\nWalter Williams and Thomas Sowell - two very prominent and outspoken black economists - usually liked to point out that before the affirmative action era blacks had lowest rates for divorce and pregnancy out of wedlock beating even the religious whites. Right now they are at the absolute bottom replaced by... you guess who.\n \nThe question is now whether there's indeed any difference between affirmative action targeting race and affirmative action targeting low socio-economic status, typically poverty.   Technically - no. Practically - it is no longer affirmative action and becomes a more typical general purpose welfare targeted at the poor and the low-earners. A better example of how such a program works can be seen in Europe where many poor immigrants of various ethnicities use the welfare system in this way.\n\nIn Europe which has a much more broad welfare nets organized around income rather than ethnicity it has precisely the same effect only with a slightly different intensity and characteristics. There was a study done a couple of years ago which pointed out that in terms of pure demographics Europe has greater social mobility than America - which is mostly due to the more general nature of welfare in Europe compared to very selective approach in America. But recently more and more the poor start  to resemble exactly the American black minority (only mostly Arabs here, black Africans are not-so-close second). That's in large part precisely because of the welfare nets which are given to the immigrants in a different, more arbitrary and more selective fashion.\n\nComing from very poor and unstable countries are very often too content with the drastically improved living situation they often refuse to integrate properly they have children who grow up as second-generation immigrants but they do in an environment that is essentially Pakistan transplanted into Sweden. That puts them at a cultural and economic disadvantage because while they come from typically low income families unlike their parents they are not able to compare it to the old conditions in their parent's home country. The lack of proper context  makes them angry, unwilling to blend in and often completely reject the new society. Often this happens even when they make some sort of economic advancement but at a high cost because they have to transgress not only working-class upbringing and culture but also religion, national and ethnic heritage etc and they do - still unfortunately - suffer from cultural prejudice. An immigrant from Poland or Hungary only has to learn the language because the countries are not very different from Britain or Germany. Only the pay is different. An immigrant  from Iran has to learn the language, learn new customs which affect the lifestyle, bridge an economic gap which is much larger than for former soviet countries and often deal with family which is much farther away. \n\nSo how does affirmative action (or selective welfare in European case) come into the picture. It makes things **too easy** in an unsustainable, artificial way. It makes the same mistake as NINJA mortgage loans. Puts people in a position where they can't cope as well as they would otherwise.  It doesn't really change any of the underlying issues it smooths the initial hurdles... until it doesn't anymore. Then since you did nothing to change your conditions you still need welfare.  That's why blacks have failed to improve their socioeconomic condition in America and that's why increasingly immigrants to Europe (but also welfare-dependents native population!) create a similar semi-pathological underclass.\n\nSo to sum things up while welfare has many negative economic results nothing is more counter-productive or destructive to  natural, spontaneous improvement of someone's economic status than arbitrary, targeted welfare and affirmative action. It eliminates incentives for self-improvement and reinforces current faults. It doesn't allow for development of self-reliance and economic independence and creates a sense of entitlement \n\nThe difference between allocating limited resources according to skin colour or the size of income is completely irrelevant. The results are the same. It is much better - if one really wants to have welfare and government involved for philosophical or political reasons - to provide society-wide nets of public education, healthcare etc which treat everyone equally. It will still create differences because human society inherently abhors equality but those differences will be natural and will not stand in the way of long-term improvement of socioeconomic status.\n"}, {"id": "cmhn61w", "body": "This post has been reinstated after being deleted following a discussion between the mods.

It eliminates incentives for self-improvement and reinforces current faults. It doesn't allow for development of self-reliance and economic independence and creates a sense of entitlement \n\nThe difference between allocating limited resources according to skin colour or the size of income is completely irrelevant. The results are the same. It is much better - if one really wants to have welfare and government involved for philosophical or political reasons - to provide society-wide nets of public education, healthcare etc which treat everyone equally. It will still create differences because human society inherently abhors equality but those differences will be natural and will not stand in the way of long-term improvement of socioeconomic status.\n"}, {"id": "cmhpeoq", "body": "Your post is awesome and really well said.

I also studied economics - and even taught it for a time -  so I do have the knowledge which helps solving socio-economic issues in a scientific way without resorting to overt politics.\n\nAffirmative action is a program which works along the rules of **zero-sum game** within a given demographics by assigning higher priority in access to resources to some individuals *at the expense of others*. It is not a program which works by increasing the *total* pool of available resources but just re-assigns who gets to use them within the same initial parameters. It also typically works from the bottom up which means that it is the *least* advantageous people who get thrown off the lists to make space for the privileged ones. It is therefore deeply unethical in terms of an egalitarian approach in a society.\n\nTechnically speaking affirmative action should not be implemented at all for any purposes *if you really care about long-lasting effects*. There is a whole lot of economic and psychological reasons why it doesn't work, is a waste of resources and works often to the detriment of society. As a matter of fact in terms of society-wide effects understood in net terms and without racial bias there is *no* evidence that it works other than the obvious fact of special treatment for black and other minority individuals - which is a political criterion not a scientific one.\n\nIt is important to understand that there is a difference between affirmative action understood as a political slogan (as Obamacare or example) and the actual program classified in actual economic terms. In political terms affirmative action includes *all* programs aimed to help the blacks. In economic terms it only includes *selective welfare and preferential treatment* and should be treated distinctly from other general-purpose welfare programs.\n\nAffirmative action works by lowering standards for performance for selected individuals whenever taken into consideration for a job, place in a school, access to resources, welfare or government grants or any other similar situation. It works under the assumption that rather than do something to help improve the results it is better to adjusts the thresholds so as to low-performing individuals will not be rejected.  It does nothing to address the causes of the low performance of said ethnic groups - that is the purpose of selective welfare or welfare in general. As a matter of fact affirmative action results in the direct opposite - by removing incentives for self-improvement, increased discipline, adjusting your plans to realistic options in the future etc.\n\nThe best evidence for the lack of results is the comparison for two culturally  distinct ethnicities in America - Black and Asian. Blacks were the main (or even *only* ) recipient of affirmative action aid while Asians largely made do on their own. The result (cultural factors aside) Blacks as a group are entirely dependent on welfare and government help and suffer disproportionately from any adverse activity (like the \"not racist at all\" war on drugs) while Asians constitute the most educated and highest earning demographic.\n\nWalter Williams and Thomas Sowell - two very prominent and outspoken black economists - usually liked to point out that before the affirmative action era blacks had lowest rates for divorce and pregnancy out of wedlock beating even the religious whites. Right now they are at the absolute bottom replaced by... you guess who.\n \nThe question is now whether there's indeed any difference between affirmative action targeting race and affirmative action targeting low socio-economic status, typically poverty.   Technically - no. Practically - it is no longer affirmative action and becomes a more typical general purpose welfare targeted at the poor and the low-earners. A better example of how such a program works can be seen in Europe where many poor immigrants of various ethnicities use the welfare system in this way.\n\nIn Europe which has a much more broad welfare nets organized around income rather than ethnicity it has precisely the same effect only with a slightly different intensity and characteristics. There was a study done a couple of years ago which pointed out that in terms of pure demographics Europe has greater social mobility than America - which is mostly due to the more general nature of welfare in Europe compared to very selective approach in America. But recently more and more the poor start  to resemble exactly the American black minority (only mostly Arabs here, black Africans are not-so-close second). That's in large part precisely because of the welfare nets which are given to the immigrants in a different, more arbitrary and more selective fashion.\n\nComing from very poor and unstable countries are very often too content with the drastically improved living situation they often refuse to integrate properly they have children who grow up as second-generation immigrants but they do in an environment that is essentially Pakistan transplanted into Sweden. That puts them at a cultural and economic disadvantage because while they come from typically low income families unlike their parents they are not able to compare it to the old conditions in their parent's home country. The lack of proper context  makes them angry, unwilling to blend in and often completely reject the new society. Often this happens even when they make some sort of economic advancement but at a high cost because they have to transgress not only working-class upbringing and culture but also religion, national and ethnic heritage etc and they do - still unfortunately - suffer from cultural prejudice. An immigrant from Poland or Hungary only has to learn the language because the countries are not very different from Britain or Germany. Only the pay is different. An immigrant  from Iran has to learn the language, learn new customs which affect the lifestyle, bridge an economic gap which is much larger than for former soviet countries and often deal with family which is much farther away. \n\nSo how does affirmative action (or selective welfare in European case) come into the picture.

As a matter of fact affirmative action results in the direct opposite - by removing incentives for self-improvement, increased discipline, adjusting your plans to realistic options in the future etc.\n\nThe best evidence for the lack of results is the comparison for two culturally  distinct ethnicities in America - Black and Asian. Blacks were the main (or even *only* ) recipient of affirmative action aid while Asians largely made do on their own. The result (cultural factors aside) Blacks as a group are entirely dependent on welfare and government help and suffer disproportionately from any adverse activity (like the \"not racist at all\" war on drugs) while Asians constitute the most educated and highest earning demographic.\n\nWalter Williams and Thomas Sowell - two very prominent and outspoken black economists - usually liked to point out that before the affirmative action era blacks had lowest rates for divorce and pregnancy out of wedlock beating even the religious whites. Right now they are at the absolute bottom replaced by... you guess who.\n \nThe question is now whether there's indeed any difference between affirmative action targeting race and affirmative action targeting low socio-economic status, typically poverty.   Technically - no. Practically - it is no longer affirmative action and becomes a more typical general purpose welfare targeted at the poor and the low-earners. A better example of how such a program works can be seen in Europe where many poor immigrants of various ethnicities use the welfare system in this way.\n\nIn Europe which has a much more broad welfare nets organized around income rather than ethnicity it has precisely the same effect only with a slightly different intensity and characteristics. There was a study done a couple of years ago which pointed out that in terms of pure demographics Europe has greater social mobility than America - which is mostly due to the more general nature of welfare in Europe compared to very selective approach in America. But recently more and more the poor start  to resemble exactly the American black minority (only mostly Arabs here, black Africans are not-so-close second). That's in large part precisely because of the welfare nets which are given to the immigrants in a different, more arbitrary and more selective fashion.\n\nComing from very poor and unstable countries are very often too content with the drastically improved living situation they often refuse to integrate properly they have children who grow up as second-generation immigrants but they do in an environment that is essentially Pakistan transplanted into Sweden. That puts them at a cultural and economic disadvantage because while they come from typically low income families unlike their parents they are not able to compare it to the old conditions in their parent's home country. The lack of proper context  makes them angry, unwilling to blend in and often completely reject the new society. Often this happens even when they make some sort of economic advancement but at a high cost because they have to transgress not only working-class upbringing and culture but also religion, national and ethnic heritage etc and they do - still unfortunately - suffer from cultural prejudice. An immigrant from Poland or Hungary only has to learn the language because the countries are not very different from Britain or Germany. Only the pay is different. An immigrant  from Iran has to learn the language, learn new customs which affect the lifestyle, bridge an economic gap which is much larger than for former soviet countries and often deal with family which is much farther away. \n\nSo how does affirmative action (or selective welfare in European case) come into the picture. It makes things **too easy** in an unsustainable, artificial way. It makes the same mistake as NINJA mortgage loans. Puts people in a position where they can't cope as well as they would otherwise.  It doesn't really change any of the underlying issues it smooths the initial hurdles... until it doesn't anymore. Then since you did nothing to change your conditions you still need welfare.  That's why blacks have failed to improve their socioeconomic condition in America and that's why increasingly immigrants to Europe (but also welfare-dependents native population!) create a similar semi-pathological underclass.\n\nSo to sum things up while welfare has many negative economic results nothing is more counter-productive or destructive to  natural, spontaneous improvement of someone's economic status than arbitrary, targeted welfare and affirmative action. It eliminates incentives for self-improvement and reinforces current faults. It doesn't allow for development of self-reliance and economic independence and creates a sense of entitlement \n\nThe difference between allocating limited resources according to skin colour or the size of income is completely irrelevant. The results are the same. It is much better - if one really wants to have welfare and government involved for philosophical or political reasons - to provide society-wide nets of public education, healthcare etc which treat everyone equally. It will still create differences because human society inherently abhors equality but those differences will be natural and will not stand in the way of long-term improvement of socioeconomic status.\n"}, {"id": "cmin128", "body": "Because I had to edit the post heavily because of the 10000 character limit I include part of the old post which comments on the rarely mentioned political context of affirmative action in America.  That should help to put things in perspective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause civil rights movement is taught in schools and promoted in the media in a very propagandized fashion as a great social advancement which doesn't leave a whole lot of space for constructive criticism people don't realize that it wasn't all that great when the government got involved. The civil rights act and a number of government initiatives spearheaded by LBJ weren't really directed at helping black community in the South as much as at regaining control over the political capital there.  The Democratic party which has been long associated with defense of slavery started to lose influence in the South  as a result of Northern Democrats (such as JFK) pushing for civil rights reforms. That led to the creation of the \"Dixiecrat\" faction which gave and advantage in the South to the Republicans who could also count on the black vote (which is why it was so heavily combated by the Democrats with various laws). Blacks voted Republican traditionally as a result of the Civil War. When the Dixiecrats separated it meant that the Democratic party needed to find  a way to weaken Republicans or strengthen themselves - best by extending the Northern faction and including blacks.  So by design the system couldn't be arranged in a way which would leave the blacks with too great degree of independence if they didn't want to risk - among other things - that the voter base would later be disillusioned with their new party and return to the old party in a decade or two.\n\nThe best example I could give would be late XIX century German reforms which introduced pension system.  It wasn't meant to help people but to stave off boiling unrest which threatened the German (mostly Prussian) aristocracy in the second most urbanized and industrialized country in the world at the time (also the country that produced Karl Marx). Similarly in the US it was meant to remove the initiative from the black community with its terrifying leaders Martin Luther King (for Christians) and more militant Malcolm X (for Muslims) and put it back in the hands of white-dominated government.   I do fully subscribe to the theory that both were assassinated with the knowledge of US authorities because of how inconvenient their influence has become both in resolving internal issues and MLK's opposition to the war in Vietnam (which was *very* important to LBJ).\n\nAffirmative action in practice boiled down to removing any means for a community to lift itself from poverty and low social status and transfer those means exclusively into the hands of the government. Instead of political unity, strong leaders, growing socio-economic activity that was directed against white oppression the black community got the \"helpful\" hand of the *white* government which made the decision for cynical, calculated and not ideological or honest purposes. That guarantees that anyone who wants to have a role in it will have to either play nice or get involved in the government structures which effectively neutralizes such individuals. That is also why since MLK there were no comparable figures while we constantly see Al Sharptons, Jesse Jacksons and Barack Obamas (yes I think he is a disgrace to his own heritage)"}, {"id": "cmhn61w", "body": "This post has been reinstated after being deleted following a discussion between the mods. As indeed some of the reasons for deletion were valid I amended it accordingly to make it more appropriate. Couple of general remarks to clear up the situation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I disagree that the action should be based on socioeconomic status** - which is against OP's view in accordance with CMV guidelines. This should fulfill the rule of challenging the view to \"however minor\" degree.\n\n**I also disagree that the affirmative action should be based on any other status including race** - It is against OP's assumption but I believe that it made the debate here completely unfair and unnecessarily biased and in fact would amount to sopaboxing (we need affirmative action!) which *is* against the rules of this sub so I disregarded it. There are also two important reasons for that:\n\n* Any argument *for* affirmative actions should be scientific rather than political and that it should be based on the program's actual results and efficiency. Therefore since it is rather obvious that it doesn't work as a general principle changing the criteria of allocation of resources is illogical and pointless because it doesn't address the causes of the program's failure. It just changes the political constituency which benefits.\n\n* In America in particular there is high enough correlation between poverty and race that changing the criteria from \"black\" to \"poor\" is really no significant change at all other than expanding it to other impoverished communities which will make the program even more unmanageable and problematic.\n\nBelow the edited original post:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I am a European so I am free from certain cultural bias that Americans share - that is to say I am not racist because I don't approve of welfare for blacks. I am also fairly well acquainted with American politics and history so I do know what happened.  I also studied economics - and even taught it for a time -  so I do have the knowledge which helps solving socio-economic issues in a scientific way without resorting to overt politics.\n\nAffirmative action is a program which works along the rules of **zero-sum game** within a given demographics by assigning higher priority in access to resources to some individuals *at the expense of others*. It is not a program which works by increasing the *total* pool of available resources but just re-assigns who gets to use them within the same initial parameters. It also typically works from the bottom up which means that it is the *least* advantageous people who get thrown off the lists to make space for the privileged ones. It is therefore deeply unethical in terms of an egalitarian approach in a society.\n\nTechnically speaking affirmative action should not be implemented at all for any purposes *if you really care about long-lasting effects*. There is a whole lot of economic and psychological reasons why it doesn't work, is a waste of resources and works often to the detriment of society. As a matter of fact in terms of society-wide effects understood in net terms and without racial bias there is *no* evidence that it works other than the obvious fact of special treatment for black and other minority individuals - which is a political criterion not a scientific one.\n\nIt is important to understand that there is a difference between affirmative action understood as a political slogan (as Obamacare or example) and the actual program classified in actual economic terms. In political terms affirmative action includes *all* programs aimed to help the blacks. In economic terms it only includes *selective welfare and preferential treatment* and should be treated distinctly from other general-purpose welfare programs.\n\nAffirmative action works by lowering standards for performance for selected individuals whenever taken into consideration for a job, place in a school, access to resources, welfare or government grants or any other similar situation. It works under the assumption that rather than do something to help improve the results it is better to adjusts the thresholds so as to low-performing individuals will not be rejected.  It does nothing to address the causes of the low performance of said ethnic groups - that is the purpose of selective welfare or welfare in general.

Legal discrimination should be eliminated and the only way to do it is through government action since it is government implementing it. Cultural or economic discrimination however exists in people's minds and putting a rule that says \"you can't do it\" will only re-locate it somewhere else. If someone is determined to hate black people **they will find a way**. America was a deeply prejudiced society and for such cases sometimes 50 years might not be enough for differences to disappear totally.   Some people will remain racist to the day they die even if they act politely on the outside. I have such people in my family and there's no explaining that they're wrong. It's primal, it's irrational and requires maturity and intellectual effort. Very few people do it. Banning racism cause those people to hide and hate more. It won't change their beliefs.\n\nWhat the affirmative action disrupted is the spontaneous support that blacks were receiving from whites who were made aware of their plight in US society before civil rights era.  That was a powerful impulse which put young, educated people - the future of the country - on the side of the victims.  People do support the underdog, and they do support the victims so letting black communities struggle - while counter-intuitive - would produce greater spontaneous support from an average American.\nThe lack of government-sponsored ghettoes and ghetto culture would also prevent the slide of the image of blacks from regular people into the awful stereotype of welfare queen or a thug which does a lot to hurt public reception between ethnicities.\n\nNot to mention that there has been a disproportionate degree of abortions among blacks which would not happen most likely if the institution of family among them wasn't so utterly devastated. That would also mean that blacks would constitute more than meager 13% of society.\n\nThe lack of affirmative action which has always been a zero-sum game would also mean that whites who lost out dues to racial points would not feel disgruntled. If you lose a job because you have the wrong skin colour or lose a place in an university because of that you do get angry - and rightfully so. \n\nAll those elements would most likely cause a significant shift in how blacks would be perceived in the society which is a fundamental factor in how an average black person in America is being treated in life - which determines employment, education etc etc.  And that as Asians proved can change **drastically** within a generation or two.\n\nThe best affirmative action blacks could receive was one they were preparing for themselves by being disciplined, getting organized, supporting each other while they endured unfair treatment.   It's cruel but it's true -that's how the world works. That's how it has always worked and unfortunately it looks that it will always work this way for as long as humans are jerks.\n"}, {"id": "2nvkqg", "body": "_____\nThis topic is under the assumption that affirmative action should be implemented.\n\nI'm aware that racial discrimination is a reality (especially in the US) but affirmative action based on race seems illogical.

Some universities give preference to certain students if they think it would benefit the atmosphere and culture of the school - athletes, musicians, artists, poor students, etc. Some universities want their students to have certain talents and/or experiences that promote some sort of cultural atmosphere. Following this pattern, and the fact that different races *in general* have different experiences, it's not illogical for universities to value diversity of races and/or cultures.\n\nIs diversity of cultures/races an inherently good thing? Well, that's going to depend on what you determine to be valuable, which is - to some degree - subjective. In any case, it's irrelevant whether they are inherently good; almost every university places some value on virtues other than just grades and test scores (as exemplified above). Different universities have different goals for their cultural atmospheres. I wouldn't think of these goals in terms of good or bad. I would think of them in terms of supply and demand. \n\nIn a free society of buyers and sellers, if there's a large market of buyers who demand a product with quality X, then one should expect to find some sellers who will supply such a product - regardless of how arbitrary quality X is. These sellers aren't good or bad (in most cases); it's just the law of supply and demand. More specifically, different potential students demand different preferences regarding the type of campus atmosphere they want in a university. Some students are interested in a racially diverse campus; others are not. Therefore, we should expect that at lest some universities will supply racially diverse campuses to satisfy the demanding market. Is this right or wrong? Neither. Is it logical? Yes, it's supply and demand. \n\nI guess I could somewhat understand your assertion that affirmative action was illogical if you believed that grades and test scores were the *only* valuable traits for university students, or if you believed that a campus with high grades was always objectively more valuable than a campus with lower grades. However, I doubt anyone believes this. The majority of students place some value (arbitrary or not) on certain experiences, talents, and/or skills of the students at the campus. But even if you only value grades and test scores, that would just be one opinion among millions. What *would* be illogical is if no college practiced affirmative action even though a non-negligible portion of students *do* value diversity. \n\nOn principle, I personally don't hold a position on affirmative action either way (I think arguments along the lines of \"society owes Black's preferential treatment\" and \"affirmative action discriminates Whites and Asians\" are equally bogus). However, I'm against implementations of affirmative action where severely under-qualified students are admitted. For example, I remember watching an interview with Thomas Sowell where he noted that black students at MIT were the top 10% in the country, but the bottom 10% at MIT. Many were on academic probation. That's absurd. In this case, affirmative action was abused to the point that it became objectively wrong - it took what could have been successful students and mis-matched them into an institution where they unnecessarily struggled."}, {"id": "2nvkqg", "body": "_____\nThis topic is under the assumption that affirmative action should be implemented.\n\nI'm aware that racial discrimination is a reality (especially in the US) but affirmative action based on race seems illogical.

What demographic should affirmative action (AA) target?\n\nI still think socioeconomic status is the best indicator for providing AA. Isn't the whole purpose of AA to provide opportunities to those who normally would not receive any? Wouldn't providing opportunities to those entrenched in poverty be a good approach. I understand that certain ethnicities (e.g. African Americans) face systemic discrimination. However, I would say (for example) that a white individual from below the poverty line would need more help than an African American individual whose annual household income is $1million. The poorer individual would likely have little access to adequate education and therefore a decent paying job which would then condemn his/her children into the same cycle of poverty.  The wealthier individual, regardless of race, would have more access to better education, social connections, and employment opportunities. There are plenty of statistics that show that, for the most part, the children of wealthy people end up wealthy.  Basically, the point of AA is not to end discrimination, it's to help people who are trapped in an otherwise inescapable cycle.\n\n2. Is implementation practical?\n\nI don't really know how practical implementation would be.  Certainly, there are people who abuse the system (i.e. welfare, food stamps, etc.) but I have no idea how many. (Anyone have statistics?) Regardless, the abuse of the system, if serious, is something that should be changed, not treated as written law.

Some are taller, some are shorter, but the two *populations* are roughly equal.  Now, if I force all the orange people to slouch all the time, there is still a height distribution, and there are some orange people who stand taller than blue people (even slouching, some are tall enough that they stand well above the shorter of the orange people), and there may even be some exceptional folks who are sufficiently tall that they are taller than even most blue people.\n\nNone of this means that orange people aren't forced to slouch, or that they wouldn't be taller were it not for my slouching order.  If what you care about is \"everyone should be tall\", it certainly seems like all people who are short (for whatever reason) should be given stilts.  But if your motive is instead \"nobody should be disadvantaged because of their orangeness\", then you go around handing out stilts to all orange people, even the tall ones.\n\nPerhaps there is even a pragmatic reason why someone who cares only about height might specifically target orange people.  Maybe there's some evidence that indicates that it's easier to increase the height of someone who is slouching than someone who is not, that the marginal benefit per inch of stilts is higher for one group than another, so the same amount of resources can be applied to a stilts-to-orange-people program as to a stilts-to-short-people program and have a greater effect.\n\nI care more about the height of people than the distribution of height among a particular population - populations, after all, are made out of people - but there are reasons why even the tallest orange person has a right to receive compensatory stilts."}, {"id": "2nvkqg", "body": "_____\nThis topic is under the assumption that affirmative action should be implemented.\n\nI'm aware that racial discrimination is a reality (especially in the US) but affirmative action based on race seems illogical.

Complaints about the prequel trilogy are hilarious to me because they're really no different from the original trilogy in their intended audience, depth, and significance (except with more racist stereotypes.) Lucas has always wanted to innovate and develop film technology and use set pieces to sell the tech. His \"all green screen, all digital\" prequel trilogy approach has been taken up by a number of other popular filmmakers. He deliberately uses storyline tropes and formula in order to appeal to a mass market. The prequel trilogy was no different. He's always wanted to sell toys and merchandise and revolutionized the concept of universe tie-in and buy-in as a profit modality in film-making. He advanced that model with successful prequel tie-ins in video games and even animated television series. I don't think it's possible for Abrams to make a film that's more shallow than any film in the original trilogy unless he actively attempts to do so.\n\nUltimately, most complaints about the prequel trilogy were not shared by kids. Adults who grew up with Star Wars and its influence had the whole \"Lucas raped my childhood\" thing going on, but they kept forgetting that they themselves were much younger and less jaded when they enjoyed the original trilogy. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford weren't going to win any awards for their acting. Alec Guinness was nominated because he was Alec F'in Guinness. Most of the awards were for innovations in set-design, music, special effects, sound design, etc. Only one of the screenplays--arguably one of the worst ones, *A New Hope*--was nominated, iirc. The main difference between the prequel trilogy and the original is that all of the technical innovations were less noticeable. **Star Wars** looked and sounded *really* new at the time, and was therefore exciting and eye-opening. The prequels were just technological innovations that were designed to be undetectable if perfectly executed. Lucas' well-known distaste for managing actors resulted in bad performances from Natalie freaking Portman and Hayden Christensen, but you could arguably say the same about the original  trilogy actors. I've seen (or heard) performances by at least two of the stars that ran circles around their work in the original trilogy.\n\nSo, really, all JJ has to do for the hype to be deserved is to demand non-wooden performances from his actors, choose and direct a good script, and maintain the classic SW look, sound, and feel while innovating it into the future in a logical manner that's consistent with the existing universe. I think his track record with Trek is a strong indication that he can do that. The main issue with new Trek, to my mind, is that we're just re-hashing old stories with a twist and not adding much in the way of *new* content to the universe. But they're still fun to watch, and Abrams doesn't need to do any better than that to match the original trilogy in quality if you're able to divorce yourself from the lens of your younger self and view those films more objectively. Abrams has shown, throughout his career, that he can direct actors to deliver compelling performances, even when the material is shallow. (His decision to allow new Bones to caricature old Bones is regrettable, though.) He certainly knows how to make things look good, even just based on a few trailer shots.\n\nSo, I'm stoked. I'm nervous about Serkis, not totally sold on the screenwriter, and am wondering how Luke, Leia, and Han are going to be used, but I don't think he will make a *worse* movie than Lucas ever did because one of his main strengths as a director is the humanization of idealized, pre-existing characters."}, {"id": "2nvjrj", "body": "So the new teaser trailer dropped and we're going to be drenched in hype until it drops in cinema late next year.

I don't think I will be able to put up with al this until then. It's not going to flop, how can it. Episode I was dire and it made &gt;$900M.\n\nI thought the Original Trilogy was too camp to enjoy. It was okay at times and I can't argue it didn't have a positive effect on others. Then rolled the Prequel Trilogy and OMFG were they bad. They were such a jumbled chaotic mess. He laid his hands back on the OS and fucked them up taking things that the fans loved (So Han didn't shoot first?

Abrams has shown by the new Star Trek films that he's a somebody not afraid to shake things up. To his credit I like that, instead of going with the flow he made bold choices.

I'm sure this topic has come up in this subreddit before but I still haven't been convinced to change my view. I concede that one should not eat pets that have already been \"claimed\" (i.e. don't take your neighbor's cat and put it in your soup). However, why shouldn't one be able to go to the local dog pound to pick up some meat for dinner? Animals in shelters/pounds are not \"claimed\" by anyone and will eventually be euthanized. So why not let someone benefit from these animals?  \n\nAdditionally, I find the distinction between cats/dogs and other animals to be confusing.  Why is it so appalling to consume cats/dogs when we have no problems with eating pigs and sheep? I've encountered the argument that cats/dogs have \"evolved\" with the human race, but to be honest, all animals that are currently alive are equally \"evolved\". Of course, historically, cat/dogs have had their uses beyond just being food but this idea doesn't seem to apply to horses (which were used as transportation), sheep (which provide wool), pigs (provide leather), and cows (provide leather).\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the input! (Initially, I was quite overwhelmed.) Special thanks to /u/HeddaLettuce and /u/crayshack for offering great ideas and data sources. I've posted this somewhere in the thread but decided to post it somewhere more visible: \"I've come to the conclusion that pet consumption should be discouraged based on potential health problems (*definitely not because we should feel bad about it or because some animals are \"more intelligent\" than others*). Additionally, large scale maintenance of dog/cat farms (and subsequently large scale consumption) would be economically inefficient. However, the government should not ban pet consumption because dogs/cats eaten in small amounts is not detrimental to health or economy.\"\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you assume  it is wrong to eat humans for whatever reason, then you must make a logical distinction between what is human and what is non human. This is a very difficult question to answer because it the very simple genetic differences are largely academic and do not contribute to the ethical discussion. \n\nAside from genetics, the distinction between ANY non-human animal and humans (on a conceptual level) is tenuous at best. Some people say it is based on intelligence or sentience. This is of course nonsense because those same people generally would NOT eat a human who was in a persistent vegetative state or a severely mentally disabled human. Those latter two examples are clearly not as intelligent or sentient as a pig or sheep which are animals that most Americans think are fine to consume. Is it okay to eat a chimpanzee? How about a silver-back gorilla? A bonobo? A dolphin? A raven? A pig? These are all animals that are more similar to you, than you are to a two-year-old human, from an intelligence point of view. This points out the hypocrisy of the \"intelligence\" argument. (Personally, I would MUCH rather eat a severely mentally disabled human or a human in a persistent vegetative state than I would a pig. A pig WANTS to be alive, can think and experience joy and sorrow. The first two examples cannot. That being said, since I have a choice, I would far, far, far rather eat broccoli which doesn't care if I eat it or not. Likewise, a human in a persistence vegetative state can produce leather and hair and all manner of viable products. But for reasons that defy logic, we don't use them for such.)\n\nSome people say that it is something non-specific like a \"soul.\" This is of course nonsense because there is no scientifically defined thing as a \"soul\" and so can't figure into a rational discussion. It would be easy enough to simply pick and choose what animals YOUR particular belief system assigns \"souls\" and then call those animals off limits. \n\nSome people say the difference is a biological ability to feel pain or suffering, e.g. a limbic system or something similar. This is of course nonsense because there is no rational school of thought that says livestock don't feel pain and suffering in very similar (if not exactly the same) ways as humans. And of course they do in fact have a limbic system.\n\nThere are some vegans who struggle with where to draw the line between animals (should NOT be consumed, for the above listed reasons) and plants (perfectly fine to consume) because there are a few animals that seem to straddle the line between animal and vegetation. These are generally VERY simple animals like sea sponges or oysters and things of the sort.

You bring up great points about the ambiguities of the line separating food and non-food. Because humans are animals, if one doesn't draw distinctions among animals and doesn't consider the will of prey, one could justify cannibalism which would open questions to whether capital punishment/suicide/murder/assisted suicide are acceptable actions.

I'm sure this topic has come up in this subreddit before but I still haven't been convinced to change my view. I concede that one should not eat pets that have already been \"claimed\" (i.e. don't take your neighbor's cat and put it in your soup). However, why shouldn't one be able to go to the local dog pound to pick up some meat for dinner? Animals in shelters/pounds are not \"claimed\" by anyone and will eventually be euthanized. So why not let someone benefit from these animals?  \n\nAdditionally, I find the distinction between cats/dogs and other animals to be confusing.  Why is it so appalling to consume cats/dogs when we have no problems with eating pigs and sheep? I've encountered the argument that cats/dogs have \"evolved\" with the human race, but to be honest, all animals that are currently alive are equally \"evolved\". Of course, historically, cat/dogs have had their uses beyond just being food but this idea doesn't seem to apply to horses (which were used as transportation), sheep (which provide wool), pigs (provide leather), and cows (provide leather).\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the input! (Initially, I was quite overwhelmed.) Special thanks to /u/HeddaLettuce and /u/crayshack for offering great ideas and data sources. I've posted this somewhere in the thread but decided to post it somewhere more visible: \"I've come to the conclusion that pet consumption should be discouraged based on potential health problems (*definitely not because we should feel bad about it or because some animals are \"more intelligent\" than others*). Additionally, large scale maintenance of dog/cat farms (and subsequently large scale consumption) would be economically inefficient. However, the government should not ban pet consumption because dogs/cats eaten in small amounts is not detrimental to health or economy.\"\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That's because moral relativism also requires us to accept that these beliefs, behaviors, and practices are *true.* Then you're forced to hold onto some strange positions: The Aztecs believed that ritual sacrifice kept the universe going and it would have been immoral for the Aztecs to not sacrifice people to their gods because they would have risked the destruction of the universe. Hitler sincerely believed that the Jews (and other groups) were a primary cause of Germany's problems and were in fact a genetic defect of humanity, and therefore it would have been immoral for him to do anything *but* order their murders in order to achieve racial purity and prevent further harm to Germany. Morally no different than culling defective animals to increase herd health, from his point view.\n\nAnd that's just for fairly black and white proposals where an objective harm to individuals can be observed--people were murdered in both cases, but one is accepted as a cultural quirk and the other is a crime against humanity. If moral relativism is true, then both acts are contextually moral, and must be perceived as such by all people.\n\nLet's look at a very simple case. Jane thinks that it's ok to steal because property is a myth perpetrated by capitalists. Margo thinks that it's wrong to steal because it deprives a person of their property unlawfully. If Jane steals from Margo, and moral relativism is true, then Jane has done a moral act. Margo must accept the theft, because from Jane's point of view, she hasn't done anything immoral. From a practical standpoint, there can be no rules that govern how societies operate if we accept the truth of moral relativism. There's no reason, if moral relativism is true, to place more weight on cultural or societal beliefs and traditions than individual beliefs and behaviors. Further, we must accept that intervening to stop acts we perceive as immoral is, in fact, an immoral act.\n\nThis is where a lot of people turn to evolutionary psychology in an attempt to find some sort of objective moral truth. For instance, it should be universally true that mass murder is wrong from a societal health point of view. But humanity wasn't teetering on the brink just because Hitler murdered a few million people. DNA propagated, populations increased, humanity endured. Yet most modern Westerners would probably agree, from an instinctive place inside, that genocide and mass murder, even if based on sincere beliefs, is wrong. If moral relativism is true, this is an incorrect judgment.\n\nThe issues of child consent you bring up is a hot topic of debate in human rights circles. Even if no psychosexual or psychosocial harm is reported by the child, is it still wrong to force children to perform fellatio, engage in anal sex, be forced to marry, be denied education due to their sex or religious affiliation, or have their sexual tissue removed or modified? If it's ok in another culture, why not in ours? Why even bother having laws against it? Again, this is why moral relativism is equivalent to moral nihilism, and moral nihilism is not terribly useful as a societal construct even if it is true. Moral relativism leaves no room for change. For example, in America it is generally accepted these days that slavery is wrong. Certainly this was not always the case. With moral relativism as the rule, there's no room for the abolitionist to say, \"I am judging you to be wrong, and I don't give a crap what your Bible or your daddy or your community or your culture says.\"\n\nMany moral relativists try to place more weight on sincerely held beliefs (religious, traditional, etc.) than other kinds of beliefs, and so reject arguments based on what they believe to be insane propositions. For example, a moral relativist might argue that no one would sincerely hold the belief that torturing children *for fun* is a moral act. But, somehow, for the moral relativist, the torture of children *for religious purposes* is somehow acceptable.\n\ntl;dr: If moral relativism is true, no act, even performed by an individual in a society where the majority does not hold the same beliefs, can be immoral.

Hitler sincerely believed that the Jews (and other groups) were a primary cause of Germany's problems and were in fact a genetic defect of humanity, and therefore it would have been immoral for him to do anything *but* order their murders in order to achieve racial purity and prevent further harm to Germany. Morally no different than culling defective animals to increase herd health, from his point view.\n\nAnd that's just for fairly black and white proposals where an objective harm to individuals can be observed--people were murdered in both cases, but one is accepted as a cultural quirk and the other is a crime against humanity. If moral relativism is true, then both acts are contextually moral, and must be perceived as such by all people.\n\nLet's look at a very simple case. Jane thinks that it's ok to steal because property is a myth perpetrated by capitalists. Margo thinks that it's wrong to steal because it deprives a person of their property unlawfully. If Jane steals from Margo, and moral relativism is true, then Jane has done a moral act. Margo must accept the theft, because from Jane's point of view, she hasn't done anything immoral. From a practical standpoint, there can be no rules that govern how societies operate if we accept the truth of moral relativism. There's no reason, if moral relativism is true, to place more weight on cultural or societal beliefs and traditions than individual beliefs and behaviors. Further, we must accept that intervening to stop acts we perceive as immoral is, in fact, an immoral act.\n\nThis is where a lot of people turn to evolutionary psychology in an attempt to find some sort of objective moral truth. For instance, it should be universally true that mass murder is wrong from a societal health point of view. But humanity wasn't teetering on the brink just because Hitler murdered a few million people. DNA propagated, populations increased, humanity endured. Yet most modern Westerners would probably agree, from an instinctive place inside, that genocide and mass murder, even if based on sincere beliefs, is wrong. If moral relativism is true, this is an incorrect judgment.\n\nThe issues of child consent you bring up is a hot topic of debate in human rights circles. Even if no psychosexual or psychosocial harm is reported by the child, is it still wrong to force children to perform fellatio, engage in anal sex, be forced to marry, be denied education due to their sex or religious affiliation, or have their sexual tissue removed or modified? If it's ok in another culture, why not in ours? Why even bother having laws against it? Again, this is why moral relativism is equivalent to moral nihilism, and moral nihilism is not terribly useful as a societal construct even if it is true. Moral relativism leaves no room for change. For example, in America it is generally accepted these days that slavery is wrong. Certainly this was not always the case. With moral relativism as the rule, there's no room for the abolitionist to say, \"I am judging you to be wrong, and I don't give a crap what your Bible or your daddy or your community or your culture says.\"\n\nMany moral relativists try to place more weight on sincerely held beliefs (religious, traditional, etc.) than other kinds of beliefs, and so reject arguments based on what they believe to be insane propositions. For example, a moral relativist might argue that no one would sincerely hold the belief that torturing children *for fun* is a moral act. But, somehow, for the moral relativist, the torture of children *for religious purposes* is somehow acceptable.\n\ntl;dr: If moral relativism is true, no act, even performed by an individual in a society where the majority does not hold the same beliefs, can be immoral.

Liberal Arts students from state schools are a dime a dozen; trust me, I'm one of them. Liberal Arts students from top schools (like Yale) are not, and thus are still high in demand regardless of their degree. A liberal arts degree from a top school will offer many more networking opportunities than a liberal arts degree from a state school which significantly less, and in the current job market networking is everything as opposed to education. \n\nOn top of that, liberal arts students most likely aren't going to succeed in engineering majors, and vice verse. If you're telling your children that they have to pick a certain major to go to a top school (I assume you're talking about STEM majors) then they may decide to major in something they have no interest in and won't succeed in just to go to a top school. As such, you're increasing the likelihood that they don't compete their education if they go to a top school by forcing them into a major they went succeed in. If this happens then you will truly waste your money as your children won't get a degree and you'll be out thousands of dollars. A liberal arts degree from a top school is a better investment than no degree at all.\n\nFinally, there are multiple options in terms of paying for school. I'm assuming your kids would have student loans that you would pay if they went to a top school (or even a state school as I don't know how Florida state schools work for in state residents). With student loans there are multiple payment options. One of them is income based student loan payments. With this, you would only have to pay a percentage of your kids' income (or have them help pay) instead of having a set monthly payment. So, if your child only makes $40k/year after initially graduating then their student loan payments would be a certain percentage of that as opposed to being a set amount that they/you may not be able to afford.
