He also gave (some form of) explicit permission for the person to do as they pleased. The fact that he is using the same word to describe this as forced sex using violence or drugs is, to me, appalling.\n\nI mostly want to object to your claim here, which is that rape is a word that \"describes...forced sex using violence or drugs.\" I think that in our more contemporary culture, especially influenced by feminist thought (controversial on reddit, I know), rape is not exclusively *forced* sex but sex without consent. \n\nI agree to an extent that the most predominant way to initiate sex without consent is through force, but force doesn't need to be violent or through the use of drugs: it could be through emotional manipulation, coercion, or deception. \n\nFeminists have tried to change legislation and improve rape education (\"teach men not to rape\") in order to change the perception that you have to be a thug lurking in dark alleys to be a rapist, but ultimately I think this has been controversial because after a certain point, how do you prove in certain cases that consent was not achieved? It also allows for rape to be unintentional (\"how was I supposed to KNOW she didn't want it?\") But, I think that we do use \"rape\" to refer to these unwanted instances of sexual contact where we had no control, and we were not \"forced\" in the way you are suggesting, even when we are not seeking justice where evidence would have to be collected. If that makes sense.\n\nThat being said, the fact that Shia LaBeouf was raped during an art installation where he consented to submit to anything people did to him makes things tricky, I believe. It's pretty shitty that someone would choose to take advantage of him sexually and it makes perfect sense that he would feel violated (raped). I think you'd have to be a pretty fucked up person to attend such an art exhibit just to get your rocks off, but you're right that Shia could have stopped it if he really wanted to. Still, I think he has every right to feel uneasy about it, and to consider it \"unwanted sex,\" which as I've demonstrated, seems to be what \"rape\" means nowadays. Could he get a rape conviction for these individuals? Probably not. But he's not trying, is he? \n\ntl;dr: I think a lot of people think that \"rape\" necessarily has to be something that is criminal, and that if you could never possibly get a rape conviction, it's not rape, but I think these people use it more as a word to mean \"sex I didn't want\" than anything else."}, {"id": "cmh9eiu", "body": "Amramovi\u0107 could have stopped it too when she originally did her art exhibit in 1974, that doesn't mean she wasn't assaulted.

Firstly, if you don't belong to a part of a disadvantaged group then you should not be speaking for it. Secondly, and again as someone who has been sexually assaulted, what happened to him was rape and he's very brave for speaking out about it. The absence of \"no\" is not a \"yes.\" Think of his silence and unresponsiveness *as* a drug. If I'm on drugs and someone knows that and uses that fact in order to have sex with me, it is assault even if I cannot say no. His piece had ground rules from the beginning and one of them was to steadfastly not respond. This woman knew that, exploited that vulnerability, and used it to her advantage to initiate a sexual act. Though I am not an artist and can't imagine myself not reacting, had he responded, his entire piece would have been ruined. There were money from sponsors, artistic reputation, and I'm sure plenty of other factors such as shock and fear that led him to keep quiet. This isn't a slap in the face to victims of physically violent assault, in fact it's quite the opposite; by coming forward he's giving a voice to the constantly stated fact that men can be raped and that rape happens under a variety of circumstances which could inspire other victims of less \"traditional\" (can't think of the word I'm looking for in English) forms of rape to seek help."}, {"id": "2nurqb", "body": "Recently, Shia Labouf did an art installation where he invited people to come and do whatever they wanted to him.

Consensual rape is incoherent by definition.\n\nHowever, a person *can* consent to have sex. If I say, \"You can have sex with me,\" then I have given consent for you to have sex with me. If I say, \"You can do whatever you want with me,\" and there's a reasonable expectation that \"whatever\" may even include things that I find unpleasant like sex, then I have given consent. After all, many people enjoy sex, and there are artists who have experienced worse things for their art.\n\nAn objection that's been raised is that my statement wouldn't excuse someone who decided to murder me, but this analogy may be a bit misleading. Surely, by giving blanket consent, a person does waive *some* rights. For instance, if I say, \"You can do whatever you want to me,\" and you decide to poke me for five minutes, I have no right to say that you've harassed me, even though under normal circumstances that kind of behavior would be unacceptable. If, however, after that five minutes, I say that I want you to stop poking me but you continue to do so, I can rightly claim that you're not respecting my interests. Continuing to poke me despite my protest would be an unreasonable interpretation of \"You can do whatever you want to me.\" Presumably when someone says that, they intend for there to be limits on what they mean. Likewise for the case of murder. It's unreasonable to expect that someone wants to be murdered.\n\nAs another example, I may say to my girlfriend, \"We can do whatever you want tomorrow.\" It would be unreasonable for her to think that \"whatever\" includes getting a tattoo of a penis on my forehead. Despite ambiguities in language, we can still make sense of consent based on what a reasonable person might expect.\n\nBy adopting this \"reasonable expectation\" standard, we don't have to deny the experiences of people who don't say \"No.\" when a rapist attacks them. A person who \"freezes\" may do so because they are perhaps shocked or fearful or intoxicated. Shia's case doesn't seem like it fits any of these conditions. It was his art performance. He was able but unwilling to say \"Stop.\" This seems different from cases where a person is psychologically unable to do so.  We may rightly say \"He could have said no.\" without \"victim blaming.\"\n\nTo use one more analogy, a boxer consents to be beaten senseless.  Under normal circumstances, repeatedly punching someone in the head is unacceptable, but in the context of a fight, this action is perfectly permissible.  If, however, during the middle of the fight, he decides to quit, he can say so, and his opponent will have to stop immediately.  In this case, the fight is the boxer's \"performance art.\"  Likewise, during Shia's \"performance,\" he could have said no, but he didn't.  Shia's case seems closer to a boxing scenario than a frat house rape scenario."}, {"id": "2nurqb", "body": "Recently, Shia Labouf did an art installation where he invited people to come and do whatever they wanted to him.

He had the sign there; as far as I know he never retracted consent.\n\nHOWEVER. There's also a social/psychological meaning of \"rape\", which I think you were getting at with your comment about victims. In that sense, I absolutely think that he was raped. Rape is illegal because of the way it psychologically scars people. Let's define this rape as \"someone having sex with you without your freely given consent.\"\n\nMOST rapes aren't violent, and rape doesn't have to involve drugs. This is where the phrase 'freely given' comes in. If you are in a position where saying no \"isn't an option\", then a \"yes\" or a lack of a 'no' don't count as consent. This is actually how a lot of sexual abuse in dating relationships happens.Some examples: Someone asks over and over, and keeps asking UNTIL you say \"yes\". Or your partner treats \"no\" as a sign that you don't love them. If you're being emotionally manipulated into \"not saying no\", that doesn't count as consent.\n\n\nLaboef was in a position where there was pressure on him NOT to say 'no'. If he said no, he was violating his promise to let people do whatever they wanted to him. The woman who raped him saw that, and used that as a tool to have sex with him regardless of whether he wanted sex. That's rape.\n\nFor the record, my beliefs on rape come from having friends who have been raped. I actually found out ABOUT this because a friend of mine who has been raped made a facebook post about how angry she was that people are saying that what happened to Labouf \"doesn't count\"."}, {"id": "2nurqb", "body": "Recently, Shia Labouf did an art installation where he invited people to come and do whatever they wanted to him.

(EDIT: http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/30/shia-labeouf-collaborators-turner-ronkko-speak-alleged-rape-iamsorry-art-show No one said they could do whatever they wanted to him!) If an injured man tells his doctor \"Do whatever you want\" in response to him asking if he's okay to try a new medicine is it then fine for the doctor to hurt and then rape the patient? No, consent must be given in the correct context and in this case it was not explicitly given in the correct context.\n\nJust because he didn't say no it doesn't mean it can't be rape, he was remaining silent for the entire ordeal, couldn't see (I presume) and was alone in a room. This means that when the woman started whipping him he was likely scared and thats without taking into account him possibly having mental issues. If a 16 year old girl was raped by her uncle but she was too scared, uncomfortable or just in shock to say \"no, stop it\" then is it consensual and not rape? Again no, explicit permission was not given and there are many factors that could have prevented him from saying no, he could have been completely open to the \"rape\" but it also could've actually been rape. Also rape is a spectrum, so saying its appalling that he is comparing it to violent forced sex isn't really needed. Rape could be when someone is unconscious, injured, too emotionally traumatised to say no etc. so just remember there are different types of rape.\n\nTL;DR: Yes it could be what you're saying but that doesn't mean it is in every case.

I'm here to advocate the equal treatment of relationships in our society. Many of these are illegal, but I believe they shouldn't be. Some relationships (like polygamous or incestuous ones), while not always illegal, don't receive the same treatment when it comes to marriage equality either. I believe everyone should have the right to marry who you want. There's no real reason you shouldn't be allowed to marry your brother, or marry five of your brothers for that matter. \n\nNeither pedophilia/hebephilia or bestiality have as many of the \"negative effects\" that society seems to believe exist. Many underage persons in consensual sexual relationships are brought before society and told they were raped and scarred for life, despite their constant defense of the older party. While animals can't verbally consent, there are many blatant signs when an animal is \"in heat\". It doesn't help that there are many videos on the internet of animals having sex with humans on their own accord.\n\nWhile I myself am none of these things, I believe that they should be treated equally. Love isn't something that is bound by arbitrary laws set by the government, it knows no bounds.\n\nEdit: It seems people are misunderstanding my point on marriage. I'm only applying it to polygamy and incest, as children/animals would have no benefit in marriage.\n\nEdit 2: I don't mean for kids of any age to be having sex with any adult, just for the age of consent to be lowered to a reasonable level. When kids start having sex (with each other) as early as 10, it's not good to suppress someone's sexuality until they become \"of age\".\n\nEdit 3: Was gone all day, and I'm getting tired of having to repeat myself multiple times while on a tablet.

OPEC is creating a false price dip by increasing supply while demand remains largely the same. Why do you think these \"dirty\" sources of oil started up? Because OPEC benefits off of speculated availabilty based on current events in the Middle East. OPEC *will not* maintain cheap oil, as it cuts into their profits and bottom dollar, so fracking and what not will just start back up again, at a less expensive start-up and run cost, since the infrastructure already exists.

Because OPEC benefits off of speculated availabilty based on current events in the Middle East.
