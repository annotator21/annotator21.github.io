In reality, because humans (from a front view, looking solely on a 2d plane) are more rectangle-shaped, generally, than triangle-shaped, it becomes difficult to design triangles around humans.\n\nAlso, because gravity vectors tend to run at a 90 degree vertical orientation from the flat plane of the ground, it is more useful to have objects with a series of 90 degree bends so that you have one part upright and one part resting against the ground (a-la frames for doors, and indeed full houses). \n\nAs someone else mentioned, hanging and trying to get through a triangular door would be horribly, needlessly complicated and would be a similarly difficult thing to mount properly so that it wouldn't slam shut the moment you opened it. It could be *done*, but why go through all those hurdles when you can just slap an 8'x4' rectangle in there and be done?\n\nAlso, for things where you need to join things together and maintain a similar relative shape, I believe rectangles come out on top. Imagine trying to make a \"longer\" piece of paper if they were all triangular; you could do it once by gluing a bottom to a bottom, and then you have a diamond and can't expand downward without first expanding outward. Not only does a rectangle keep all of your margins justified and a consistent page-width, but if you need more length for something you can just glue another sheet to the bottom ad infinitum.\n\nWhile I am a big fan of triangles in engineering (they make wonderful support structures for bridges and the like, and are an essential overall shape in aerodynamic design), for many purposes in most peoples' everyday lives, rectangles are better suited."}, {"id": "2nfwai", "body": "I am completely convinced that a triangle is a superior shape to a square.

I think the core of your view is essentially a good idea about being open to new ideas and seeking knowledge.\n\nBut I think you veer off into absurdity a bit when you say that not only must you abandon your belief, but you also have to accept the counterargument? Imagine an undecided voter in the Obama vs Romney election. There are literally people who you're expecting to vote for whoever talked to them most recently. They won't be able to \"win a debate\" against either position. At best, you can argue that maybe they should consider not voting (although I disagree with this, and can discuss if you'd like). But to expect them to submit to whomever most recently beat them in a debate is silly.\n\nAnother trouble is that its not clear what \"winning a debate\" means. Its totally plausible that not only do both people think they \"won\", but even third party observers are undecided over who was more persuasive. Furthermore, in a separate response, you implied that asking for a citation and not getting one qualifies as \"not losing\". Fine, but you can stretch this type of reasoning to cover other areas. Did they cite their sources? If not, doesn't count. Did they use any jargon or advanced concepts that you don't understand? If so, it doesn't count, because you can't be sure they used them correctly. Did they structure their argument in a complicated way? If so, it doesn't count, because you suspect they made a subtle logical error but can't pinpoint it precisely. You could also argue that even if everything your opponent says is true, there's this other concept that is important to you that outweighs what they're saying. Many of these are evasive, sometimes dishonest, and of course there are cases where someone is just wrong and should admit it, but I fail to see how in practice your view is actually objectively different from what people already do.

The issue is not whether or not a view can be defended so much as whether or not a view can be defended WELL. Now in debates, an arbitrator will be able to unbiasedly \"choose\" a winner.\n\nBut then there are other issues. \n\nFirst, consider political debates. I do not mean two random people with \"A degree in political science\" debating on /r/politics. I mean a presidential debate. Both sides will defend their views. Sometimes the view will be defended very poorly. For sake of ease, we will call this view \"X.\" Now anyone viewing the debates who believes X will very biasedly think the one defending X won. While this might be based on an appeal to authority, the viewer might neither realize this nor care.\n\nThere is also the issue of people who simply do not really know HOW to debate in general. For what it is worth, I can give a short personal true story to make my point. A friend of mine (let's call him Ed) is dreadful at debating. At one point we were discussing a topic on which we disagreed (and this was not a topic of real world significance; it was based on sci-fi/fantasy fandom). I explained my view to Ed. Every point he brought up, I managed to (admittedly somewhat snarkily) retort. After not very long, he conceded and based on what he said he changed his view. But this is not the end of the story. Not much later, a mutual friend (let's call him Tony) had a very similar discussion with Ed. I was not there, but Ed and Tony both independently confirmed it to me. Tony's view was the same as Ed's before Ed and I had our discussion/debate. Ed used arguments similar to the ones I introduced, but Tony managed to retort to all of those. Tony and I did discuss the topic but ultimately agreed to disagree. \n\nBut the question is: since Ed is not good at debating, should he have changed back to Tony's view?\n\n&gt;  If at any point you lose a debate and have no retort the only honest thing to do is to accept the counter argument as truth.\n\nThere are two distinct points here.\n\nFirst comes debate of pure opinion/preference. Discussion of better place to get pizza or which gaming console is better. In these cases, debate loses some value since despite asking \"what is the best?\" it REALLY discusses \"what is the best FOR ME?\" A hypothetical scenario: a relatively poor person has a political debate with a relatively rich person. Among other things, each side will explain why their side's economic viewpoints are better. Should the \"loser\" of the debate be required to switch political parties?\n\nNow comes the issue of a more objective debate. The best example is Young Earth Creationist(YEC) versus (for lack of a better name that I can think of now) Darwinian Evolution (DE). You may be familiar with \"Debating creationists on the topic of evolution is rather like trying to play chess with a pigeon \u2014 it knocks the pieces over, craps on the board, and flies back to its flock to claim victory.\" If we want to look at this notion in a more academic and less snarky manner, we might say that \"Each side will think it won.\" \n\n&gt;  Many will lose a debate and just shake it off like the person they lost to is nuts. But that's not honest and if you can't debate something you believe you really shouldn't believe it or at least not appear like you do.\n\nFirst issue: If you have an issue with people being dishonest about losing a debate, I think it follows you should have an issue with people pretending to hold a view. But that is not what is important.\n\nGoing back to my story with Ed and Tony, there are people either not taught how to debate or taught that to debate certain issues is the worst thing they can do. This creates too many issues INCLUDING one with your view. Even if those people face a debate which they do not learn is taboo to debate, they cannot defend either view and must constantly change.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of emotion.

As humans we do weigh emotion into our ideas and decisions. Your view, in my opinion, is attempting to change human nature itself.\n\nTo me that's a good thing though.  We are humans we have rational thought.  There are a lot of hard decisions that are hindered by emotion.  \n\nFor example the decision of ecocentrism vs anthropocentrism.  \n\nStatement: We have space.  Humans are one of many organisms on the planet earth that's in space.  Humans are destroying the planet earth.  What's position holds the greater good.\n\nAnthropocentrism: Humans are the center of the world and nothing else matters.  Our intelligence allows us to dominate and we shouldn't feel sorry.\n\nEcocentrism: Humans are one small organism on a very big problem.  Humans are not critical tho the ecosphere of earth.  More organisms are suffering due to the effects of humans than humans are themselves.  The rate at which humans are destroying the world is not sustainable.  Humans aren't even critical to the ecosphere. If all humans died there would be some changes but not major.  If all plankton died, everything dies.  If all Algae dies, everything dies.  The net benefit for the world is for humans to self exterminate.  \n\nNow ecocentrism is a very rarely held opinion.  But it does make sense for the most part.  Emotion holds people back.  Understandably nobody wants to die.  So really human nature has to change.  Either it changes via what I just wrote or we change the way we are destroying the world.  It must change or we are goners.  \n"}, {"id": "cmdddd2", "body": "&gt; But the question is: since Ed is not good at debating, should he have changed back to Tony's view?\n\nYes because he was not able to defend it.

I know it does not need to be on a stage, but that style of debate connects to my point. If we have two sides of an issue and people are there to learn which side would be better, there would almost unquestionably be a divide among the audience as to which side won.\n\n&gt; That's the entire basis of science. True until proven false and it seems to work very well in that domain. \n\nWhile true, your ideology would completely discourage any sort of questioning. Once the entire world accepts some information as true, people will have no real incentive to look for other answers. Your worldview would discourage debate as a whole.\n\nConsider this subreddit. There are plenty of threads in which no views were changed. Looking over some of them, most discussions stop at some point without either side changing their view. Would you argue that the last person in every specific comment thread be the winner and that the previous one should automatically change his or her view? If so, that is not in the spirit of this subreddit at all. In many cases there is information of a sort that WOULD change one's view, but was not provided. If you do NOT think the last commenter is necessarily the winner then how is that different from other debates.\n\n\nKeep in mind something very important: while our discussion could go on for eternity (or at least until one of us dies), it will likely not. One of us might decide that it is no longer worth to keep going (not worth one's time, understanding that there can be no convincing another due to differing definitions, etc). But that will NOT mean that the other side won. \n\nIt is perfectly acceptable to change one's view if one is convinced.
