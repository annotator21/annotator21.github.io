That being said, I think you'd find a similar reaction to similar photos released by Paris Hilton if she was as relevant as Kim Kardashian, the only reason there are differences is because those who are interested in her because of her looks are a larger percentage of the reaction compared to those who are interested in her because they care enough about her to dislike her - she's irrelevant to most who aren't particularly attracted to her.\n\nReaction to JLaw, Brittney Spears, and Amanda Bynes are all quite different.  JLaw is not a publicity whore, neither is Spears, and neither is Bynes.  JLaw is not just Reddit's current dream girl, but America's current sweetheart; of course she is going to garner a lot of positive attention.  Spears and Bynes are a particular kind of case though, they are in many ways, ex-celebrities who've experienced severe mental illness as a result of their fame.  People are going to be less likely to bash these people because they're known to be fragile, I think it's a positive sign for Reddit, and the broader society that we extend caution to people in need.\n\nBeyonce gets a hard time because she tried to remove that Hulk photo of hers from the internet, that kind of censorship runs contrary to Reddit's point of view.  That act soured Reddit's cultural perception of Beyonce, and has led to her being less well liked among its users.  People would lose their minds of Beyonce released the same photos as Kim Kardashion did though.\n\n&gt;Lastly, where are all the SJWs?? Why don't they feel the need to show support. The most I've seen is a luke-warm \"well I hate her, but she knows how to make money.\" \n\nSJW are a fringe element in Reddit's culture.  They also tend to mostly support their own (left-leaning liberal feminists).  In smaller threads where they are interested they tend to have a proportionally larger influence, but once a thread hits the front page their true proportion of Reddits userbase shows itself to be quite small. \n"}, {"id": "cm2iv4y", "body": "\u2206 for your explination of the fappining.

They elongated the neck, took in the waist and Photoshopped out all cellulite and other \"imperfections.\" Yes it could be considered artistic, but then I don't agree with the tag line \"break the internet.\" \n\nAlso you seem to be forgetting also the bad publicity all those white celebrities have faced over the years. Britney Spears was trash talked in the tabloids for years! From gaining weight to shaving her head, she was considered crazy and new unflattering pictures of her were up every day. She has since made a bit of a comeback, which is good because the paparazzi and media made her life hell while she was obviously struggling.  Amanda Bynes went \"crazy\" on twitter and many people believe she is schizophrenic based on the tabloids covering of her. I think the only reason we don't hear more is because people feel sorry for her, or don't care. Of course the first google result that comes up when you google her is her getting kicked out of Paris Hilton's VIP section of a club. And Paris Hilton has made her career on coming off stupid and shallow. I think everyone has made fun of her at one point or another. You don't hear too much bad press about Jennifer Lawrence, but there are those who call her fat and those who say her talking about junk food while she's skinny is offensive to fat people or whatever. Eventually she will be involved in a scandal and everyone will be making fun of her too. \n\n   \n"}, {"id": "2maun3", "body": "Long story short: Reddit's sex postive SJWs only come out of the woodwork when it's convenient for them.

The best we've done is find a few weak correlations, and I'll allow that these probably play a small role in predisposing children to autism, as does being male.\n\nBut the lion's share of blame rests with neglectful mothers.  It isn't necessarily malicious treatment, just neglectful.  The reason autism rates are rising is that we live in an [increasingly narcissistic society](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=-yRmVOiiB4LLsAT0iICYBg&amp;url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201401/why-is-narcissism-increasing-among-young-americans&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXvWd5iV-TbI2Tv_gl5JQfRlNv8Q) and a narcissistic mother is often just too self-absorbed to care much about anyone else, including her children - read some /r/raisedbynarcissists for mindblowing stories about this.  There may also be resentment toward the child for the body changes associated with pregnancy and childbirth for a narcissistic woman who places high emphasis on her body, which may help explain why rates of autism are higher for firstborn children.\n\nWe learn at a phenomenal rate as infants, so much and so fast that if we miss the window of opportunity to learn certain things we never get another chance.  I remember reading somewhere that if an infant were blindfolded for the first three months of life and then had the blindfold removed, it would be blind for the rest of its life.\n\nThink of an infant getting adequate maternal attention: mom's friendly face invites interaction, they babble back and forth at one another, there's plenty of eye contact - all things autists struggle with.  Now imagine an infant without these things...  it will take note of \"things\" in the absence of people, eg. that it has 6 stuffed animals, or that there are 28 books on the bookshelf - stuff autists tend to notice.  We have strong evidence that nurture (rather, lack thereof) is at least a factor from the Romanian orphans referenced in the Time link below.\n\nWe didn't evolve with easy distractions such as TV, shopping malls, iPhones, etc. and so we didn't evolve countermeasures to being extremely neglected during the crucial first few months / years of life.  Even in the case of maternal death the tribe would look after an infant.  It's only now in the modern, western, suburban world that a woman can put an infant in a crib and ignore it as she focuses on herself.\n\nThe \"refrigerator mother\" hypothesis which gained popularity in the 1940s only fell out of vogue in the 60s-70s due to pressure from feminism and its assertion that women are perfect and may never be criticized.  The actual evidence against it, as well as evidence for a genetic cause of autism, is scarce.  Science has been shamed into losing its objectivity here, as is so often the case.  For example cannabis is only now escaping stigma and prohibition based on a few flawed studies, and the studies which have recently shed light on the substance were restricted for decades, if allowed at all.\n\nAt almost 40 years old I'm too ancient to have ridden the aspergers diagnosis wave, but I'm positive I would have been diagnosed if I were 10-15 years younger.  I was severely abused and neglected by my two moms throughout childhood, and while I obviously can't remember my infancy, I have no reason to doubt it was much different from my later childhood which I do remember.  We're comfortable with teaching \"him\" (IOW, every man and boy) not to rape, why can't we have campaigns to teach \"her\" not to abuse and neglect her children?  Regardless of whether I do have aspergers (never bothered seeking adult diagnosis), and regardless of whether the neglect I endured caused it, a campaign like this could have really helped me.\n\nSome very interesting further reading for those inclined:\n\n[Measure of a Mother\u2019s Love: How Early Neglect Derails Child Development](http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/24/the-measure-of-a-mothers-love-how-early-deprivation-derails-child-development/) (Time Magazine)\n\n[The Image of the Mother's Eye: Autism and Early Narcissistic Injury](http://cogprints.org/2593/1/eye22fixed_by_cogprints.html) (Max McDowell PhD)\n\n[Autism, Early Narcissistic Injury, and Self Organization: a Role for the Image of the Mother's Eyes?](http://cogprints.org/7243/1/eye22.html) (Max McDowell PhD)\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Or it could be caused by environmental factors not related to nurturing. For instance, I have *two* disorders that have been linked to parental neglect in the past (bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder) and it was recently found that one of them is correlated with high fever during pregnancy. A person who develops a high fever during pregnancy is four times more likely to have a child who develops bipolar disorder. Similarly, a woman who had a fever for more than one week during pregnancy was also three times more likely to have a child with infantile autism. Of course, this cannot be the full answer--there are certainly people who have BPD and autism that emerged from mothers who never had a fever during pregnancy. But it's another clue that may be useful in future research.\n\nThere is also the issue that autism is a broad spectrum of behaviors and disorders. It may come to pass that we're actually looking at more than one disorder that has been clumped together due to lack of knowledge.\n\n&gt;The \"refrigerator mother\" hypothesis which gained popularity in the 1940s only fell out of vogue in the 60s-70s due to pressure from feminism and its assertion that women are perfect and may never be criticized. \n\nThis type of loaded language makes me question your ability to be open-minded  on this issue. \"Feminism\" has never asserted that women are perfect and may never be criticized. There are plenty of feminists who criticize women constantly--for being SAHMs, for working in porn, exotic dancing, or prostitution, for wearing heels and makeup, etc. And there are other feminists who have no beef with these choices or behaviors. The psychogenic theory of autism may have some amount of merit insofar as institutionalized children display some similar behaviors, but it fails to explain how the same parents can have autistic and non-autistic children. This is especially true of twins--identical twins are more likely to both be autistic but fraternal twins only have about a 10% chance of both being autistic. Presumably twins are being raised by the same people at the same time,  in similar ways so it seems odd to point at parenting problems being the **primary** cause of autism. Nor does it explain the sadly innumerable cases of children raised in neglect who *don't* have autism.\n\n&gt; We're comfortable with teaching \"him\" (IOW, every man and boy) not to rape, why can't we have campaigns to teach \"her\" not to abuse and neglect her children? \n\nAnother loaded and bold assertion. Who is \"we\"? Not everyone is comfortable with the default assumption that all men are rapists unless otherwise educated. As for teaching women not to neglect and abuse their children--good luck. There are constantly competing theories of parenting hawked by hundreds of books that parents-to-be gobble up in an attempt to be good parents. Some people cry it out, some people co-sleep, some people breastfeed until their kids are five, some hire nannies, some people stay at home. There are books and theories that recommend a wide variety of practices, some of which are believed to be abusive by some and good parenting by others. The Spare the Rod \"Christian Spanking\" movement is a good example of this. There is no one universally accepted way of raising and caring for infants and children, and even if there were, sometimes a mother or father's own psychological issues may prevent perfect practice of such methods. I suppose you could have a \"hug your babies\" campaign along the same lines as the \"back to sleep\" campaign, but I would be surprised if it resulted in a significant decrease in autism specifically. And I'm not entirely sure that someone who isn't already emotionally inclined to show affection to their children would be capable of significantly changing their behaviors based on a campaign of that nature. It's easy to pick a method for putting your kid to sleep, but it's tough to become a non-emotionally or physically distant person if that's the way you've been wired via genetics or circumstance. I elected to not have children for many reasons, but the primary one is that I'm not comfortable with physical affection or closeness, which seems to be a primary requirement for the management of infants. As a parent I would of course have done my best for a child, but I'm pretty sure the infant/child would have picked up on my stiff posture and general antsyness."}, {"id": "2maojy", "body": "There's a reason the human genome project hasn't found the gene for it after decades of searching - it doesn't exist.

If FIFA were to change locations, they would still be contractually obligated to pay Qatar for most if not all of their currently stipulated arrangements.  It is more likely than not, Qatar would financially come out ahead in this arrangement. Rewarding the government they seek to punish.  It also wouldn't have any effect on the current slavery situation.  The only thing that could have changed that is not selecting that location in the first place or putting in contractual language to prevent this issue.  Even still, it's unlikely that FIFA would jeopardize its pay day trying to enforce the issue.\n2. \"Moving\" the games would not be possible in the time period provided, so essentially it would \"skip\" to the next location.  The impact to this would negatively effect many people who have no hands in the \"wrong doing.\"  Advertisers, local businesses, team owners, players etc.  A valid angle is that these people are part of the problem, blood money, but it doesn't change the fact that you're impacting people that have no direct part in this.\n3. The idea that a team(s) would stage some sort of revolt is hopelessly naive. How many people work for a company that imports their goods?  If the answer is yes, you have *some* blood on your hands.

You think a bunch of guys raised in poverty in a third world nation are going to turn away enormous paychecks to make a bunch of rich white kids feel better about themselves?  \n4.I have yet to see a scenario which provides a lever or realistic scenario that would encourage change in these situations.  Posts that parrot these views are hopelessly naive, hand-wave the enormous amount of money at stake and attempt to inflate the value of their opinions.

Their opinions are just that, opinions, and they are worthless and hold no financial leverage within this debate. \n\nThe almighty dollar rules, slavery &amp; gay rights are worth less than advertising in this case.

[Source.](http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/02/36/32/63/faq_en_neutral.pdf) It is possible that with 8 years to go, Qatar hasn't spent as much money and might still profit although that is doubtful. It isn't always about changing policies, sometimes its just about not supporting bad practices. \n\n2. Several potential host nations are already lined up to take the place of Qatar should FIFA strip them of their host position. USA, Korea/Japan and Australia come to mind immediately. The first two already have infrastructure from previous World Cups and could essentially run the tournaments with no notice, easily less than 8 years. It will potentially hurt third parties, but no one said that taking the decision away isn't controversial. Besides 8 years is a long time from now, its not like those local business are relying on this future tournament to stay afloat today.\n\n3. There is actually some merit to the idea of teams boycotting tournaments. In the early 1900's the Olympics were the main competition for international football. Through a series of political moves, boycotts, blood feuds and I assume bribery the 1936 World Cup became the main international tournament.

With a direct phone call you can have someone to talk to in real time and give you advice for the situation, you can dial the number and set the phone down so the operator can hear what's going on, you have a live connection that the operator can trace the location back to in case you can't yourself give your address... a text is much slower, much more deliberate. You've got a limited number of characters you are allowed to send in a text, and operators might not know all the little shortened 3 letter acronyms of words in order to understand your message. I think if anything there should be some kind of existing system of euphemisms that people can be taught in order to discreetly get help from an operator without alerting someone else of your actual call.

Before that I was a music major.  I think college is a useful resource for many people who want to go into specialized occupations-- for instance, law, psychology, medicine, anthropology, teaching, etc.  There are specialized fields in which the only place with the resources to teach them is a university.  I also think that liberal arts education is a good program for these sorts of students, because it exposes them to knowledge outside of the academic tedium to which they will likely be bound to in their career--teaches people who are very interested in one subject to poke their heads up every once in a while.\n\nBUT, college is becoming \"second high school.\"  Anyone who is smart is supposed to go to college, or else they're considered subpar citizens of some sort.  There's a major for everything now--even though many subjects are not well suited to academia.  \n\nFor instance, the best way to become a musician is to find a teacher [AKA better musician,] practice and work enough to eat and pay said teacher, and then practice until you can convince a better teacher to let you pay them to teach you, and then repeat until you're good enough that somebody will pay you to do music.  Musical knowledge is not behind a paywall.  Yet, so many people think that the only way to become a real musician is to go to college for it.\n\nYou don't need to go to college to be a great writer.  You don't need to go to a four-year-college to be a great business administrator, in most cases.  You don't need to go to college to be a great journalist.  A great detective.  Graphic designer.  Chef.  Electrician.  Botanist.  *Programmer.*\n\nCRUNCH\n\nSo essentially I shouldn't be here.  But I'm here because:\n\nA) I'm smart and apparently that's what smart people do.\n\nB) My parents saved up and I'd feel bad if I didn't spend it on college.\n\nC) It's really not cool to live in your parent's basement.  Especially when you're engaged.\n\nD) No matter how good at programming I am, employers will pick someone with a college degree over me because they have no fucking idea how college or programming works.\n\nE) Everyone says that they regret not going to college and that I will regret it too.\n\nF) I feel guilty for hating college because I like the people here and because I'm supposed to like college if I'm intelligent.\n\nG) I've never had a real job.\n\nH) *** I'm a woman.  I don't plan to have kids.  As a woman, not going to college hurts my jobs chances a lot more than if I were a man.  Also, since I don't plan to have kids, not going to college is seen as being a lazy ass.\n\nReasons I shouldn't be here:\n\nA) The languages I'm learning will likely be outdated or irrelevent by the time I graduate. \n\nB) \"Liberal Arts Education\" is slowing down my learning of programming and squashing my natural love of learning by forcing me to try to attain a certain GPA.

If they don't carry over they may still help you to build your understanding of new concepts / paradigns in other platforms you adopt. One other cool thing about those seemingly antiquated, perhaps difficult, languages to use is that they become interesting talking points as you meet others in your field. \"Oh you've written assembly? That's so cool!\"\n\n&gt; but maybe I can make coffee runs.\nNo company that pays their developers good money would expect even the intern to get coffee. Your job is to write high quality code. At a software company you'll at least have a coffee machine in the office, best case (Google, Facebook) they have baristas on site. \n\nWhile the liberal arts environment may seem like a waste of your time or that it's distracting from your program it's important to consider that you may discover something really cool that you'd never heard of. Are you interested in traveling? A friend of mine spent a semester studying abroad. I was floored when she told me how easy it was for her to receive a scholarship for that semester. You say that you like the people there. Consider that many successful people met their co-founders in college before going on to develop successful companies. At the very least these people may be the ones you will one day rely on for a job, refer to an open position, hire to work at your own company. While college is not the only network you will be a part of it is a significant one. \n\nOn the topic of experience, internships, and networks have you considered or do you already publish any of your work for others to see? [GitHub](https://github.com) is an active community where software developers share their work, collaborate on larger projects, get feedback on how they can up improve their work. Not that this is what you are doing (I have no idea) but don't simply rely on what your professors dole out to you. Start your own projects to solve your own / the university community's problems (these can be quite popular). The important part being **write code**. \n\nWhile I too have considered whether or not college was useful to me I do have to say that I got certain benefits out of it that would have been very difficult to acheive or discover on my own. I know this sounds cliche but while it may seem like it will take a long time to get through stick with it because it'll be over before you realize."}, {"id": "2m9le3", "body": "FLUFF\n\nFor some background, I'm a computer science major.  Before that I was a music major.  I think college is a useful resource for many people who want to go into specialized occupations-- for instance, law, psychology, medicine, anthropology, teaching, etc.  There are specialized fields in which the only place with the resources to teach them is a university.  I also think that liberal arts education is a good program for these sorts of students, because it exposes them to knowledge outside of the academic tedium to which they will likely be bound to in their career--teaches people who are very interested in one subject to poke their heads up every once in a while.\n\nBUT, college is becoming \"second high school.\"  Anyone who is smart is supposed to go to college, or else they're considered subpar citizens of some sort.  There's a major for everything now--even though many subjects are not well suited to academia.  \n\nFor instance, the best way to become a musician is to find a teacher [AKA better musician,] practice and work enough to eat and pay said teacher, and then practice until you can convince a better teacher to let you pay them to teach you, and then repeat until you're good enough that somebody will pay you to do music.  Musical knowledge is not behind a paywall.  Yet, so many people think that the only way to become a real musician is to go to college for it.\n\nYou don't need to go to college to be a great writer.  You don't need to go to a four-year-college to be a great business administrator, in most cases.  You don't need to go to college to be a great journalist.  A great detective.  Graphic designer.  Chef.  Electrician.  Botanist.  *Programmer.*\n\nCRUNCH\n\nSo essentially I shouldn't be here.  But I'm here because:\n\nA) I'm smart and apparently that's what smart people do.\n\nB) My parents saved up and I'd feel bad if I didn't spend it on college.\n\nC) It's really not cool to live in your parent's basement.  Especially when you're engaged.\n\nD) No matter how good at programming I am, employers will pick someone with a college degree over me because they have no fucking idea how college or programming works.\n\nE) Everyone says that they regret not going to college and that I will regret it too.\n\nF) I feel guilty for hating college because I like the people here and because I'm supposed to like college if I'm intelligent.\n\nG) I've never had a real job.\n\nH) *** I'm a woman.  I don't plan to have kids.  As a woman, not going to college hurts my jobs chances a lot more than if I were a man.  Also, since I don't plan to have kids, not going to college is seen as being a lazy ass.\n\nReasons I shouldn't be here:\n\nA) The languages I'm learning will likely be outdated or irrelevent by the time I graduate. \n\nB) \"Liberal Arts Education\" is slowing down my learning of programming and squashing my natural love of learning by forcing me to try to attain a certain GPA.  (\"I can't learn chemistry for all the academics that's getting thrown at me\" is something I've lamented about at least twice every week since the beginning of this semester. This semester I learned to hate chemistry, when I used to love it, and that's about it.)\n\nC) The education I'm receiving here is subpar to what I can easily achieve on the internet for free--in fact, it inhibits my learning abilities because it forces me to learn inside a box, or be punished.\n\nD) The academia assume that the students are mindless plebeians that must be coerced into learning. (We're given grades because it is assumed that we must be explicitly motivated since we apparently lack implicit motivation.) \n\nE) The students here are taught to be arrogant and to feel entitled without having earned any actual skills.\n\nF) For all the pain and money, the rise in my chances of getting a job after graduating is not nearly high enough.\n\nG) I want to take charge of my own fucking education and make the world a better place and move and shake some shit up.  Not shackle myself to a four year education plan and then shackle myself to endless debt and to a job that I hate because I'm afraid I won't have the money to pay the debt if I pursue something I enjoy.\n\n\nAnd also I hate this place. \n\n\nFight."}, {"id": "cm2731y", "body": "One of my ( to be attained) majors is also COMPSCI and I do agree with you to a degree. - you can teach yourself programming!

I come from a small town like this.  I know a lot of people around here and at home without degrees who are smart and interesting people, and thus I find it really, really offensive.

I don't feel qualified enough for heavy-duty programming internships yet (I don't really know when I should feel qualified actually,) but maybe I can make coffee runs.\n\nDon't sell yourself short. Go out there and apply for all of it. Do not be one of those coffee getters. If you really want to be a programmer, you need a programming internship. A coffee internship will get you nothing. What matters is good experiences that you can talk about in an interview or write about in your resume. Recruiters don't expect interns to be perfect programmers. Many businesses are well aware that internships are a necessary part of education, and they want to do their part to help out a little bit, and maybe get little bit of work out of the intern too while they're at it. \n\nAlso, it's understandable if you can't get an internship. Shit can be competitive these days. If you don't get one, join one of those computer science clubs or engineering clubs or any sort of club that is making/building applications and other stuff. \n\n\nDon't waste a semester getting no experience. Hop in as soon as you can. Try to find those student projects and hop in. Honestly, these student projects could be even more important than your coursework. Taking some class will net you 2 words on your resume. Working on a student project will net you a nice little paragraph. Moreover, these little student projects are often done with the cooperation of helpful professors or TA's. These will be good connections to have. Don't want to build anything? Then just aim for a leadership position in some CS related organization. Can't find anything cool in CS? Look around in engineering. They always need programmers for their robots or airplanes.\n\n\nFinally, what year of computer science are you? I didn't do CS (engineering), but the freshman year was the worst. I had to take all these math professors that didn't give a fuck. Much of freshman year is structured to literally weed out the \"undesirable\" students. The public university I went to had 50+% failure rates in many of these classes. (Then again, these 50% failures never bothered to ask me for help during my office hours and neglected to show up at the TA session. You're paying for these resources. Use them!) I have the privilege of being both a student and a TA so I have a little bit of insight in the process. Many of these professors don't think it's their job to teach students how to learn. They don't want to do any hand holding. Professors don't have teaching degrees, they don't know what's the most effective way to teach. The only thing they know best is their own field. The only way they know how to motivate you is with bad grades. Not the best teaching method, but honestly, I think it's a better motivator than taking an online class. \n\nAnyways, things got better. The closer you get to the professor's primary field of research, and as students get weeded out, what's left are the kids who are capable of learning the material. The best classes I took were in the last years of college. The following years, you're going to be learning things that matter and the professor is hopefully more passionate about. As you get higher and higher up on the coursework, class size drops dramatically. You'll be sitting in class sizes of only 5-15 people. \n\nBut whatever you do, don't just go through the motions on autopilot. If you just hate being there so much, just go ahead and drop out before you've wasted too much money. I've seen my fair share of college graduates whose best job offer was at a call center or a shoe store. College is more than just the coursework. Employers want to see that you made plenty of connections at college while you were there.

The problem is, the most valuable things you learn from college are going to be the things that you probably wouldn't be able to teach yourself. An example: when I was a tutor at college, I heard complaints about the liberal arts education all the time. It was usually from math, science, computer science, etc, students who were really good at one thing: their major subject. They resented the fact that they had to take one or two writing classes in order to get their degree. The problem? The STEM folks who complained about liberal arts education were all terrible at writing. So bad, in fact, that they wouldn't be able to function in the workplace because their writing was incomprehensible. I had several math and science professors complain to me that their students didn't understand that there are so many other skills they need to learn in order to be successful: writing, teamwork, problem solving, awareness of basic facts about history, politics, etc.  It seems to me that the broad liberal arts education is designed with the idea that every student should graduate with basic skills and understanding in multiple areas so that they will be more flexible and successful. So, you may not need to go to college to learn the basics of botany, but any *botanist* will tell you that, to succeed in that career, you need at least an undergraduate degree and probably a masters or doctorate. Also, having been both a student and an instructor, I can tell you that academics don't think students are mindless plebeians. They didn't get into this business to simply reward and punish students for jumping through hoops, but if a student is only thinking about a class in terms of reward and punishment, and shows no interest in learning the material because the material is important or interesting, they won't expend energy trying to change your view. If you go into a class thinking the thing that matters is getting an A, and you don't care about the material, then you are the one putting yourself in a box.\n\nTL;DR: A liberal arts education is trying to take you out of the box you are already putting yourself in. Just teaching yourself the things that are easy for you to learn and ignoring the hard stuff isn't going to help you in the long run. Also, you may consider yourself \"smart\" now, but if you don't challenge yourself by stepping out of your box, you won't be able to keep up with the people who do."}, {"id": "2m9le3", "body": "FLUFF\n\nFor some background, I'm a computer science major.  Before that I was a music major.  I think college is a useful resource for many people who want to go into specialized occupations-- for instance, law, psychology, medicine, anthropology, teaching, etc.  There are specialized fields in which the only place with the resources to teach them is a university.  I also think that liberal arts education is a good program for these sorts of students, because it exposes them to knowledge outside of the academic tedium to which they will likely be bound to in their career--teaches people who are very interested in one subject to poke their heads up every once in a while.\n\nBUT, college is becoming \"second high school.\"  Anyone who is smart is supposed to go to college, or else they're considered subpar citizens of some sort.  There's a major for everything now--even though many subjects are not well suited to academia.  \n\nFor instance, the best way to become a musician is to find a teacher [AKA better musician,] practice and work enough to eat and pay said teacher, and then practice until you can convince a better teacher to let you pay them to teach you, and then repeat until you're good enough that somebody will pay you to do music.  Musical knowledge is not behind a paywall.  Yet, so many people think that the only way to become a real musician is to go to college for it.\n\nYou don't need to go to college to be a great writer.  You don't need to go to a four-year-college to be a great business administrator, in most cases.  You don't need to go to college to be a great journalist.  A great detective.  Graphic designer.

The karma system allows one 'group' to impose their beliefs on another with a, \"whose side has more people who believe [in] this,\" kind of numbers game. It always comes down to the fact that if the hive-mind does not completely agree with your opinion, your post will simply be buried deep within the bellows of the website and very little discussion will ever be had about it.  \n\nEvery Redditor knows that saying things that are generally unpopular with the majority of Reddit can mean an infinite amount of karma loss and possible continuous harassment. For example, I remember a while back (I do not have a link, sorry.) of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it, and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made (or close to) was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed non-stop. His having a different opinion than the hive-mind pretty much destroyed his account. \n\nSomething very similar happened to me once before as well when I was new to the website. I posted what is generally a very unpopular opinion on Reddit, before I was aware that it was, because it is my personal belief. The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized, something I am personally against. I asked why he was pro-legalization, stated one reason I am against it, and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion, I did not downvote him (I  upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote), and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. \n\nInstead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered, what I got was overly defensive comments (not from him, he did not reply) calling me an idiot just for having that opinion, downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it, being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise, and no real discussion to be had. I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E (/r/trees). It was /r/askreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.\n\nReddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like /r/offmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game, then what point is there in even posting your opinion if it's not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless. Intellectual conversation and debate on a topic is difficult when opinion is valued more than the quality of the post itself.\n\nSo please, change my view.\n\nEDIT: My Internet took a dive last night so I just decided to go to bed.

I'm certainly not likely to try having a deep discussion in /r/pics, as it's just not what people are looking for there. \n\nBut also, the sort of people who will actually *talk* with you are not the sort who care so much about your downvotes, if you can present your view in a clear, respectful way. \n\nIt is unlikely that you can combine any two of those together, for instance high karma and good discussions, but that's just how it is. I personally would rather have a somewhat personal, temporary connection to a stranger online, and possibly make them think about the world a little differently. "}, {"id": "cm2n3i4", "body": "&gt;What defines pointlessness? Is the goal to get lots of karma? Is it to raise awareness of some idea to lots of people? Is it to have good discussions?\n\nMy opinion is that the karma system makes none of these very possible.\n\nLots of karma is obvious.\n\nRaise awareness should also be pretty obvious because the lower your karma count the fewer people see your comment.\n\nGood discussions are also hard to come by for a variety of reasons. Not just that one side is handicapped in needing to post thoughtful and respectful content while the other can do whatever they'd like but also it's unlikely anyone will see your content because it has a low karma score and also there are few people who are interested in a good discussion because the karma system discourages those who aren't of the hivemind from actively participating in Reddit. \n\nA lot of people claim they want content from both sides but if they truly did then they would upvote non-hivemind content more often than they upvote hivemind content.

I asked why he was pro-legalization, stated one reason I am against it, and told him that his story had made my day.

I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E (/r/trees).

Must be just some kind of troll, I won't waste my time on him, I'll just downvote and move on with my life.\n\n&gt; and never seen by anyone\n\nI guess this is the core of your argument: \"If it's unpopular, people will downvote it, it will be hidden and will not generate conversation\".\n\nAnd that's where we disagree. Some of my best discussions resulted when a comment of mine was downvoted to the point it was hidden. But someone did see it (I often read hidden comments myself, and I'm far from the only one) and did respond to it and we actually had a very interesting discussion.\n\nThe fact that it is downvoted and/or hidden doesn't mean it can't generate a discussion.\n&gt; \"I was going to upvote you but then I seen you're against legalizing weed so fuck you and your opinion!\" in a PM to me.\n\nDon't tell me you honestly thing *that* is harassment..

So? Again, I come to my **core question**: what's your goal?\n\nIf your goal is for that discussion to be visible, it's pointless.\n\nIf your goal is to have that sort of discussion, reddit is one of the best places for it.\n\nLet's say you had a discussion, and it's hidden. And let's say only 50 people saw it instead of 1000. If you just want an answer/discussion you shouldn't care about how many people see it as long as you get your answer/discussion.\n\n&gt; Reddit never identified itself as a link 'aggregator';\n\nTakes a look at reddit in it's early days:\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20050814021525/http://www.reddit.com/\n\nA list of links you can upvote/downvote. That's it. The comment section didn't even exist at first. Here's the post announcing comments and the first comment:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/?sort=old\n\nThere are plenty of interviews by the founders and early employees of reddit that talk about how they started it as a link aggregator.\n\n*It's not my opinion, that's a fact.*\n\nP.S. If you are interested in the early days of reddit, one of my favorite episodes of one of my favorite podcasts is a talk with the founders of reddit:\n\nhttp://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/podcast-27/"}, {"id": "2m9ifg", "body": "(Things to consider: #1 - Those that I list on this post or in the comments are not my personal opinions, just examples I'm using unless I specifically state otherwise. #2 - I am not implying that the karma system should be removed or changed in any way, I am simply saying that the karma system is the reason behind this.)  \n\nI firmly believe that having any sort of controversial opinion on Reddit is absolutely pointless and that the karma system is the main reason that is. The karma system allows one 'group' to impose their beliefs on another with a, \"whose side has more people who believe [in] this,\" kind of numbers game. It always comes down to the fact that if the hive-mind does not completely agree with your opinion, your post will simply be buried deep within the bellows of the website and very little discussion will ever be had about it.  \n\nEvery Redditor knows that saying things that are generally unpopular with the majority of Reddit can mean an infinite amount of karma loss and possible continuous harassment. For example, I remember a while back (I do not have a link, sorry.) of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it, and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made (or close to) was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed non-stop. His having a different opinion than the hive-mind pretty much destroyed his account. \n\nSomething very similar happened to me once before as well when I was new to the website. I posted what is generally a very unpopular opinion on Reddit, before I was aware that it was, because it is my personal belief. The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized, something I am personally against. I asked why he was pro-legalization, stated one reason I am against it, and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion, I did not downvote him (I  upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote), and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. \n\nInstead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered, what I got was overly defensive comments (not from him, he did not reply) calling me an idiot just for having that opinion, downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it, being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise, and no real discussion to be had. I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E (/r/trees). It was /r/askreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.\n\nReddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like /r/offmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game, then what point is there in even posting your opinion if it's not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless. Intellectual conversation and debate on a topic is difficult when opinion is valued more than the quality of the post itself.\n\nSo please, change my view.\n\nEDIT: My Internet took a dive last night so I just decided to go to bed. I apologize. I will respond to everyone's comments individually when I am able to.\n\nEDIT 2: I apologize for the late replies. I got to doing this when I could.

I believe you're conflating karma with exposure. Reddit certainly \"buries\" replies and opinions that are not as popular, but *only* in a particular sorting option. The entire issue is rendered null when you simply sort the comments differently. It takes 2 clicks, it's right at the top of the page in the direct line of sight as you scroll down, and you don't need to navigate to any separate menu or webpage to do it. So I wouldn't really say it's a \"special option.\" Moreover, you don't have to do this every time you go to the comments. You sort for controversial opinions, for example, and it's that way. Forever, until you choose to change it. Finally, I don't think the argument can be made that this aspect of the sorting system is a systemic error on the part of Reddit. Changing it is easier than unsubscribing from a subreddit, and would you blame Reddit for forcing people to be exposed to r/adviceanimals? \n\nIf you haven't already, I would highly recommend you start sorting for controversial comments. In the opinion-oriented and debate subreddits, it often yields the best comments, in my book. \n\nBut then again, all of this is dancing around the *real* problem with reddit commenting, as I see it: the late comments being buried, or put more aptly, lost. With most posts that gain interest (as did yours, congrats!), one has to comment within the first hour or so of posting for it to have a chance at garnering interest, good or bad. Otherwise, it just gets lost, a couple upvotes, maybe a downvote, regardless of the post's quality. One can sort by new, but this rarely has utility for me, because it means sorting mostly through unfiltered mediocrity. I see this as a necessary evil of a site as popular as this one.

It was /r/askreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.\n\nReddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like /r/offmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game, then what point is there in even posting your opinion if it's not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless. Intellectual conversation and debate on a topic is difficult when opinion is valued more than the quality of the post itself.\n\nSo please, change my view.\n\nEDIT: My Internet took a dive last night so I just decided to go to bed. I apologize. I will respond to everyone's comments individually when I am able to.\n\nEDIT 2: I apologize for the late replies. I got to doing this when I could.

I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E (/r/trees). It was /r/askreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.\n\nReddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like /r/offmychest.

The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless.

Hint: It is not the same.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance\n\nTLDR: Not every opinon is worthy of discussion."}, {"id": "2m9ifg", "body": "(Things to consider: #1 - Those that I list on this post or in the comments are not my personal opinions, just examples I'm using unless I specifically state otherwise. #2 - I am not implying that the karma system should be removed or changed in any way, I am simply saying that the karma system is the reason behind this.)  \n\nI firmly believe that having any sort of controversial opinion on Reddit is absolutely pointless and that the karma system is the main reason that is. The karma system allows one 'group' to impose their beliefs on another with a, \"whose side has more people who believe [in] this,\" kind of numbers game. It always comes down to the fact that if the hive-mind does not completely agree with your opinion, your post will simply be buried deep within the bellows of the website and very little discussion will ever be had about it.  \n\nEvery Redditor knows that saying things that are generally unpopular with the majority of Reddit can mean an infinite amount of karma loss and possible continuous harassment. For example, I remember a while back (I do not have a link, sorry.) of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it, and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made (or close to) was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed non-stop. His having a different opinion than the hive-mind pretty much destroyed his account. \n\nSomething very similar happened to me once before as well when I was new to the website. I posted what is generally a very unpopular opinion on Reddit, before I was aware that it was, because it is my personal belief. The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized, something I am personally against. I asked why he was pro-legalization, stated one reason I am against it, and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion, I did not downvote him (I  upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote), and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. \n\nInstead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered, what I got was overly defensive comments (not from him, he did not reply) calling me an idiot just for having that opinion, downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it, being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise, and no real discussion to be had. I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E (/r/trees). It was /r/askreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.\n\nReddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like /r/offmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game, then what point is there in even posting your opinion if it's not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless. Intellectual conversation and debate on a topic is difficult when opinion is valued more than the quality of the post itself.\n\nSo please, change my view.\n\nEDIT: My Internet took a dive last night so I just decided to go to bed. I apologize. I will respond to everyone's comments individually when I am able to.\n\nEDIT 2: I apologize for the late replies. I got to doing this when I could. I will no longer be replying to comments on this thread as both /u/headlessgargoyle and /u/Keep-reefer-illegal have changed my perspective.
