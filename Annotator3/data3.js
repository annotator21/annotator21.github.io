You must also factor in their life experiences, year round school, athletics, activities, etc., it's part of a large puzzle that comprises a well-rounded, articulate young person. We don't have any problem filling our programs to capacity with brilliant young people, so I'm not too sure I see your point regarding some sort of \"data\" for parents or students.\n\nMy points regarding OPs question was simply noting that I have lots of experience working with both staff and students who pursue all types of degrees and are successful in many incredible ways.

These connections could propel her into fantastic positions around the world, whether it's curating, researching, lecturing, etc. However, quality networking and internship opportunities at most state schools are minimal. Thus, your willingness to pay should almost be reversed as the better the school, the more opportunities a \"useless\" degree will provide.\n\nYou might consider paying regardless of the school and, rather than limiting their options, require that they double major. If one of your children wants to be an English major, perhaps require that they also select something you deem as practical. I see many applicants with English + Economics or English + Human Biology.

Since the average working lifetime is around 45 years, they will, in fact, make back the investment 3 times over the course of their life. \n\nWould you spring for Yale? If not, why not?

That assumption is symptomatic of your broader misunderstanding of how to value degrees.\n\nArt history undergrads from Yale can do pretty much anything except become specific types of engineers.  Your potential-employment-outcomes analysis should build in the likelihood that your daughter would be like a large proportion of her liberal arts classmates and go into a highly lucrative career like finance and consulting.  These are career paths that could very well give her much greater earning potential than she would have as a state engineering school grad.  Simply being a Yale student is enough to give her a much, much greater chance of being considered for such a job than she could possibly have at a Florida state school.\n\nJust in case you don't believe me, by the way, here's what JPMorgan says it looks for in an entry-level investment banking candidate: \"A well-rounded academic background, with coursework in finance or economics, is recommended, but we are open to all majors and have training to make sure you succeed. Candidates must demonstrate academic strength, a minimum GPA of 3.2, strong teamwork, communication skills and a high energy level.\"  They have a mild preference for finance and econ, but the first thing they want is someone with a well-rounded education (i.e., exactly what a liberal arts grad gets).  In practice, I can tell you that many, many investment bankers do not have finance or econ backgrounds, but the vast majority do come from a small concentration of elite schools, none of which are state schools in Florida.  And investment banking is just one of the many lucrative doors that an elite degree would open for your daughter.\n\nMoreover, as others have mentioned, the network she would build at Yale would be of immense value (and is value that she realizes no matter what her major might be), but you have not even attempted to include that value in your calculations. \n\nTo be honest, the sense I get is that you just have an axe to grind vis-a-vis elite schools and want to try to prove a point through your daughter.  It's sad, to me--your daughter would be in a better position now (at least with respect to her schooling) if you were to lose all of your money, because schools like Yale give massive need-based tuition subsidies, and would not place ideologically-motivated restrictions on her receipt of their aid."}, {"id": "2nv869", "body": "I have one child in college now, and three more who will be heading off in the next few years.

If your daughter (or other kids) get into an Ivy League School, they are pretty much set for life, regardless of major. That alone makes the investment worthwhile.\n\nA more appropriate example would have been a small, private liberal arts college with no reputation beyond its local region. Say your kid wanted to go to a small liberal arts college in Nebraska for art history. This would be an advantage if your kid wanted to stay out there and get hired in Omaha, Lincoln, or other regional cities, but if they just want to return to Florida, then the name of their institution might as well be imaginary. In this scenario, I can understand not wanting to fund the full cost of their degree.\n\nHowever, not all private colleges are equal. I don't know schools in Florida, but say there is one that is great for art history and has a track record for getting their students internships at museums and other cultural institutions that turn into jobs. That college would be worth the investment.\n\nOne more example: Say your kid wants to pursue a major that isn't offered at UF or FSU. I don't know what those schools do and don't offer, but I'm currently a student in urban planning, and my major is only offered at two universities in my state. While not a STEM career, many of the jobs in my field are with engineering firms. While one program is at the overall highest ranked university in my state, the other one (the one I attend) is not, but its program is highly ranked in my chosen field.

Letting people interact with you any way they want to. If you break character no matter what than the art piece is ruined. Even having the option to quit or someone there for your protection also completely takes the away what makes this art. It's very similar to Marina Abramovi\u0107's Rhythm 0. Whether he was raped or not I do not know, but after reading about Rhythm 0 and the action of the audience I wouldn't be surprised if things got weird. Especially since it involved the element of privacy. I think if anything he was trying to emulate what a previous artist did, but he got a little too big for his britches and didn't really acknowledge the full spectrum of possibilities. Here's the wikipedia entry below on Abramovi\u0107's Rhythm 0.\n\n\"To test the limits of the relationship between performer and audience, Abramovi\u0107 developed one of her most challenging (and best-known) performances. She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force which would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use (a sign informed them) in any way that they chose. Some of these were objects that could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed the audience members to manipulate her body and actions.\nInitially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \u201cWhat I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.\u201d ... \u201cI felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\u201d\""}, {"id": "cmh3h55", "body": "What the fuck is wrong with people.

The point is that while we might not object to someone's claim about having done art, out of politeness, it doesn't mean we have to actually believe in it.  I'm saying there are things that are worth believing to be art, and others that are less well qualified for the term.  In particular, if the definition of art is so inclusive as to include almost any human behavior, then the term loses meaning.\n\n&gt; they literally could be using the performance as a metaphor to express anything.\n\nThis goes back to losing meaning again.  If a performance is so generic that it can express anything, then it's hardly a performance at all.\n\nThis reminds me a bit of the various works that have experimented with blank canvases, blank pieces of paper, etc.  At some point in the history of art, this was new and could be considered thought-provoking - but only to a limited extent, and having done it once, repeating it is fairly uninteresting and does not require much creative effort or skill.\n\nI am talking about LaBeouf, though, not Abramovic.  Abramovic's performances are original, and she tends to express herself strongly in them.  Her ability to do this is one of the things which has led to the respect she commands as an artist, and one of the things which makes her kind of work difficult to achieve.\n\nLaBeouf seems almost to be doing the opposite, from the derivative nature of his various statements and acts, to his copying a 40-year old performance of Abramovic's but with a bag over his head, which had the effect of removing any need to engage his audience or actually express himself except completely passively.\n\nNot to mention that the #iamsorry piece was done in collaboration with two other artists, which makes it seem as if LaBeouf was just playing another rather uninteresting role as an actor, being directed by someone else.  That's not to say that acting isn't art, but even seen as acting this is pretty uncreative.\n\n&gt; i don't see why it can't be art just because it reminds you of something else.\n\nI'm not saying it's not art because it reminds me of something else, I'm saying its nature does not seem like that of art.  \n"}, {"id": "cmh7bn0", "body": "interesting. i disagree. if the artist says it is art, it is art. \n\ni think it is a pretty cool idea, to see how humanity would react to a specific situation.\n\nbut that is the cool thing about art, it is all a matter of perspective.

He also gave (some form of) explicit permission for the person to do as they pleased.

However, he did more than not say no. He made the exhibit inviting people to interact however they choose without restrictions. That is the point of his exhibit.

Consensual rape is incoherent by definition.\n\nHowever, a person *can* consent to have sex.  If I say, \"You can have sex with me,\" then I have given consent for you to have sex with me.  If I say, \"You can do whatever you want with me,\" and there's a reasonable expectation that \"whatever\" may even include things that I find unpleasant like sex, then I have given consent.  After all, many people enjoy sex, and there are artists who have experienced worse things for their art.\n\nThe murder analogy may be a bit misleading.  Surely, by giving blanket consent, a person does waive *some* rights.  For instance, if I say, \"You can do whatever you want to me,\" and you decide to poke me for five minutes, I have no right to say that you've harassed me, even though under normal circumstances that kind of behavior would be unacceptable.  If, however, after that five minutes, I say that I want you to stop poking me but you continue to do so, I can rightly claim that you're not respecting my interests.  Continuing to poke me despite my protest would be an unreasonable interpretation of \"You can do whatever you want to me.\"  Presumably when someone says that, they intend for there to be limits on what they mean.  Likewise for the case of murder.  It's unreasonable to expect that someone wants to be murdered.\n\nAs another example, I may say to my girlfriend, \"We can do whatever you want tomorrow.\"  It would be unreasonable for her to think that \"whatever\" includes getting a tattoo of a penis on my forehead.  Despite ambiguities in language, we can still make sense of consent based on what a reasonable person might expect.\n\nBy adopting this \"reasonable expectation\" standard, we don't have to deny the experiences of people who don't say \"No.\" when a rapist attacks them.  A person who \"freezes\" may do so because they are perhaps shocked or fearful or intoxicated.  Shia's case doesn't seem like it fits any of these conditions.  It was his art performance.  He was able but unwilling to say \"Stop.\"  This seems different from cases where a person is psychologically unable to do so."}, {"id": "cmhbc8z", "body": "You can't consent to be murdered in the same sense that you can't consent to be raped.

Do you have a source for the claim that he invited people to do whatever they wanted to him, or are you assuming this given what you heard about the exhibit and its similarity to  Marina Abramovi\u0107's 2010 project?\n\nHere is a quote from one of the collaborators on the project:\n\n&gt;Early Sunday morning, Nastja S\u00e4de R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 and Luke Turner tweeted some \"important clarifications\" about LeBeouf's art show, writing, \"Nowhere did we state that people could do whatever they wanted to Shia\" and \"As soon as we were aware of the incident starting to occur, we put a stop to it.\"\n\n[Source](http://gawker.com/shia-lebeouf-collaborators-confirm-sexual-assault-incid-1664888771)"}, {"id": "cmh1v88", "body": "&gt;He could have stopped it at any moment, and chose not to. He also gave (some form of) explicit permission for the person to do as they pleased. The fact that he is using the same word to describe this as forced sex using violence or drugs is, to me, appalling.\n\nI mostly want to object to your claim here, which is that rape is a word that \"describes...forced sex using violence or drugs.\" I think that in our more contemporary culture, especially influenced by feminist thought (controversial on reddit, I know), rape is not exclusively *forced* sex but sex without consent. \n\nI agree to an extent that the most predominant way to initiate sex without consent is through force, but force doesn't need to be violent or through the use of drugs: it could be through emotional manipulation, coercion, or deception. \n\nFeminists have tried to change legislation and improve rape education (\"teach men not to rape\") in order to change the perception that you have to be a thug lurking in dark alleys to be a rapist, but ultimately I think this has been controversial because after a certain point, how do you prove in certain cases that consent was not achieved? It also allows for rape to be unintentional (\"how was I supposed to KNOW she didn't want it?\") But, I think that we do use \"rape\" to refer to these unwanted instances of sexual contact where we had no control, and we were not \"forced\" in the way you are suggesting, even when we are not seeking justice where evidence would have to be collected. If that makes sense.\n\nThat being said, the fact that Shia LaBeouf was raped during an art installation where he consented to submit to anything people did to him makes things tricky, I believe. It's pretty shitty that someone would choose to take advantage of him sexually and it makes perfect sense that he would feel violated (raped). I think you'd have to be a pretty fucked up person to attend such an art exhibit just to get your rocks off, but you're right that Shia could have stopped it if he really wanted to. Still, I think he has every right to feel uneasy about it, and to consider it \"unwanted sex,\" which as I've demonstrated, seems to be what \"rape\" means nowadays. Could he get a rape conviction for these individuals? Probably not. But he's not trying, is he? \n\ntl;dr: I think a lot of people think that \"rape\" necessarily has to be something that is criminal, and that if you could never possibly get a rape conviction, it's not rape, but I think these people use it more as a word to mean \"sex I didn't want\" than anything else."}, {"id": "cmh2wzi", "body": "&gt;I agree to an extent that the most predominant way to initiate sex without consent is through force, but force doesn't need to be violent or through the use of drugs: it could be through emotional manipulation, coercion, or deception.\n\nEmotional manipulation and coercion are not rape.

He also gave (some form of) explicit permission for the person to do as they pleased. The fact that he is using the same word to describe this as forced sex using violence or drugs is, to me, appalling.\n\nI mostly want to object to your claim here, which is that rape is a word that \"describes...forced sex using violence or drugs.\" I think that in our more contemporary culture, especially influenced by feminist thought (controversial on reddit, I know), rape is not exclusively *forced* sex but sex without consent. \n\nI agree to an extent that the most predominant way to initiate sex without consent is through force, but force doesn't need to be violent or through the use of drugs: it could be through emotional manipulation, coercion, or deception. \n\nFeminists have tried to change legislation and improve rape education (\"teach men not to rape\") in order to change the perception that you have to be a thug lurking in dark alleys to be a rapist, but ultimately I think this has been controversial because after a certain point, how do you prove in certain cases that consent was not achieved? It also allows for rape to be unintentional (\"how was I supposed to KNOW she didn't want it?\") But, I think that we do use \"rape\" to refer to these unwanted instances of sexual contact where we had no control, and we were not \"forced\" in the way you are suggesting, even when we are not seeking justice where evidence would have to be collected. If that makes sense.\n\nThat being said, the fact that Shia LaBeouf was raped during an art installation where he consented to submit to anything people did to him makes things tricky, I believe. It's pretty shitty that someone would choose to take advantage of him sexually and it makes perfect sense that he would feel violated (raped). I think you'd have to be a pretty fucked up person to attend such an art exhibit just to get your rocks off, but you're right that Shia could have stopped it if he really wanted to. Still, I think he has every right to feel uneasy about it, and to consider it \"unwanted sex,\" which as I've demonstrated, seems to be what \"rape\" means nowadays. Could he get a rape conviction for these individuals? Probably not. But he's not trying, is he? \n\ntl;dr: I think a lot of people think that \"rape\" necessarily has to be something that is criminal, and that if you could never possibly get a rape conviction, it's not rape, but I think these people use it more as a word to mean \"sex I didn't want\" than anything else."}, {"id": "cmh5jqr", "body": "&gt; (\"teach men not to rape\")\n\nThis is something in the feminist frame I particularly take offensive with, it demonizes men and implies rape is a single gender issue.
