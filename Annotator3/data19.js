The scientific method has been around since the 1700's, and it often works well, but it occasionally fucks up in a major way. That's the nature of the beast.\n\nWould you want it declared child abuse *not* to give a retarded child a lobotomy? There was a time when doctors honestly thought that was the best way to treat retardation -- would you want to make it against the law for parents to disagree?\n\nThere's that point. Then there's also the point that the side effects of severe treatment often make the treatment simply not worth it.\n\nForcing a parent to put an unwilling child through, let's say, chemotherapy is deeply unethical. Chemo often kills people, especially children, and especially children who have already been weakened by the disease. Even when it doesn't kill the patient it is being administered to, it will definitely cause a great deal of sickness and pain, as well as irreversible damage to the brain, liver, and bones. \n\nIt will ensure that rather than having a few more months or years to play, make friends, have adventures, and, in general, *live*, the child will have to spend the ensuing months or years in bed, weak and sick from being fed actual poison.\n\nIt will certainly, definitely do all of those things. It might also cure the cancer, temporarily. But -- and this is the important part -- *it also might not.* It might do all of those things and still fail. There is a *fairly good chance* that it will do all of those things and still fail.\n\nIf you were a parent, wouldn't you want to be able to make the choice about which of those futures you want for your child -- the one where they live a year or two longer but spend that year or two sick, in pain, and in bed, or the one where they have a little less time but get to live that time happily and fully?

There seems to be two main reasons behind this:\n\n1.) We shouldn't teach kids to behave well in order to get things.\n\n2.) Lying to them about Santa will cause trust issues later in life.\n\nNeither of these are good reasons. Legends of Santa or a Santa-like figure have existed for centuries and they haven't brought about any sort of social issues. The idea of Santa isn't teaching children that the only reason to be good is to get something, it's simply a fun idea for Christmas. Kids don't suddenly become malevolent people once they find out that Santa didn't deliver those presents. And regardless of that, in real life, doing good things *does* often result in rewards, so it's not as though the idea is false.\n\nThe, imo, more ridiculous issue is that children will fall into some sort of existential crisis when they find out Santa isn't real. I've never met anyone who has suddenly developed trust issues after they found out. Most kids seem to just get over it after like an hour. If there is a child for whom the discovery of the truth behind Santa leads to trust issues or trauma, then that child hasn't developed a healthy sense of reasoning, and if something as insignificant as Santa would be enough to push them into mental issues, then they will inevitably be faced by far worse examples of lying later on that will take a more extreme toll. It's not the idea of Santa, it's the individual and their ability to understand basic social norms and customs. \n\nAs said before, Santa is an idea that's been around for ages. It's never caused any problems before and while people have every right to not teach their kids about him, doing so in order to protect them is frankly juvenile and unnecessary. By doing so they are denying their children a fun and harmless tradition that makes Christmas an amazing time for millions of other across the world.\n\n**TL;DR** Santa is harmless and all those claiming that the idea that he's harmful are being oversensitive.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**EDIT** I have read all the comments, and the only reason that I haven't replied to all is because for some I would be repeating myself and because some comments just seemed to be oddly passive-aggressive, considering that this place is meant to change views and not try to subtly insult people. *But* anyway, I'm going to CMV because even though I still believe that the story of Santa is inherently harmless and that the accusations of it being bad are exaggerated, a few users have commented on how it *can* potentially be harmful. Namely, some parents could use it as a form of blackmail. I personally think that any parent who does this is a shitty parent, and it has more to do with them than the idea of Santa itself (I've never felt threatened or blackmailed, so it's not necessary). However, my OP was saying that it's completely harmless, and I can see how it can be used in a horrible way, so the level of harm that the Santa lie can create is fairly dependant on the parents/those implementing it."}, {"id": "cmbqu4c", "body": "Your point that this has been going on for generations isn't an actual argument.

There seems to be two main reasons behind this:\n\n1.) We shouldn't teach kids to behave well in order to get things.\n\n2.) Lying to them about Santa will cause trust issues later in life.\n\nNeither of these are good reasons. Legends of Santa or a Santa-like figure have existed for centuries and they haven't brought about any sort of social issues. The idea of Santa isn't teaching children that the only reason to be good is to get something, it's simply a fun idea for Christmas. Kids don't suddenly become malevolent people once they find out that Santa didn't deliver those presents. And regardless of that, in real life, doing good things *does* often result in rewards, so it's not as though the idea is false.\n\nThe, imo, more ridiculous issue is that children will fall into some sort of existential crisis when they find out Santa isn't real. I've never met anyone who has suddenly developed trust issues after they found out. Most kids seem to just get over it after like an hour. If there is a child for whom the discovery of the truth behind Santa leads to trust issues or trauma, then that child hasn't developed a healthy sense of reasoning, and if something as insignificant as Santa would be enough to push them into mental issues, then they will inevitably be faced by far worse examples of lying later on that will take a more extreme toll. It's not the idea of Santa, it's the individual and their ability to understand basic social norms and customs. \n\nAs said before, Santa is an idea that's been around for ages.

Namely, some parents could use it as a form of blackmail. I personally think that any parent who does this is a shitty parent, and it has more to do with them than the idea of Santa itself (I've never felt threatened or blackmailed, so it's not necessary).

The purpose of the Santa lie is to create a positive experience for the child (the exhortation to behave notwithstanding).  The only kind of lie it might encourage is the kind that results in surprise birthday parties and the like.\n\nThere's no loss of moral authority in being found out about being Santa.  This is not the discovery of any kind of pattern.  The Santa lie (with the tooth fairy and easter bunny) aren't a 'gateway lie'.\n\nI'm a dad who has a 10yo.  I don't know if he still believes in Santa, but if he doesn't he's smart enough to know it's in his best interest to pretend that he does.  I've never admitted to my mum that I don't believe in santa.  I simply comment on how much I'm looking forward to what santa brings me this year.  I was using that technique to get a full stocking at the end of my bed when I was 35.  It only stopped when santa had a grandson!  :)\n\n"}, {"id": "2na59s", "body": "An increasingly popular idea, especially on Reddit it seems, is to not tell children Santa exists. There seems to be two main reasons behind this:\n\n1.) We shouldn't teach kids to behave well in order to get things.\n\n2.) Lying to them about Santa will cause trust issues later in life.\n\nNeither of these are good reasons. Legends of Santa or a Santa-like figure have existed for centuries and they haven't brought about any sort of social issues. The idea of Santa isn't teaching children that the only reason to be good is to get something, it's simply a fun idea for Christmas. Kids don't suddenly become malevolent people once they find out that Santa didn't deliver those presents. And regardless of that, in real life, doing good things *does* often result in rewards, so it's not as though the idea is false.\n\nThe, imo, more ridiculous issue is that children will fall into some sort of existential crisis when they find out Santa isn't real. I've never met anyone who has suddenly developed trust issues after they found out. Most kids seem to just get over it after like an hour. If there is a child for whom the discovery of the truth behind Santa leads to trust issues or trauma, then that child hasn't developed a healthy sense of reasoning, and if something as insignificant as Santa would be enough to push them into mental issues, then they will inevitably be faced by far worse examples of lying later on that will take a more extreme toll. It's not the idea of Santa, it's the individual and their ability to understand basic social norms and customs. \n\nAs said before, Santa is an idea that's been around for ages. It's never caused any problems before and while people have every right to not teach their kids about him, doing so in order to protect them is frankly juvenile and unnecessary. By doing so they are denying their children a fun and harmless tradition that makes Christmas an amazing time for millions of other across the world.\n\n**TL;DR** Santa is harmless and all those claiming that the idea that he's harmful are being oversensitive.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**EDIT** I have read all the comments, and the only reason that I haven't replied to all is because for some I would be repeating myself and because some comments just seemed to be oddly passive-aggressive, considering that this place is meant to change views and not try to subtly insult people. *But* anyway, I'm going to CMV because even though I still believe that the story of Santa is inherently harmless and that the accusations of it being bad are exaggerated, a few users have commented on how it *can* potentially be harmful. Namely, some parents could use it as a form of blackmail. I personally think that any parent who does this is a shitty parent, and it has more to do with them than the idea of Santa itself (I've never felt threatened or blackmailed, so it's not necessary). However, my OP was saying that it's completely harmless, and I can see how it can be used in a horrible way, so the level of harm that the Santa lie can create is fairly dependant on the parents/those implementing it."}, {"id": "cmbr57i", "body": "&gt;Santa-like figure have existed for centuries and they haven't brought about any sort of social issues.\n\nThere's no data to support this.
