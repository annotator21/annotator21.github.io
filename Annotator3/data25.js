But here's something to consider.  Let's talk about the driving example.  Why would the punishment, in this case, be the lower end of the spectrum rather than the higher one?  In other words, why should we treat someone going 40 over and killing someone accidentally as just going 40 over, rather than treating someone going 40 over and not killing anyone as going 40 over and killing someone (since they very easily could have?)  Realistically it seems both would have to move more towards the middle range.\n\nIn other words, this system would have to amp up the punishment on those crimes with reckless or negligent fault elements but that don't actually hurt others, to recognize the fact that the action COULD have killed someone.  Now, I'll argue that this is actually a bad way to do a justice system, because the outcome is important for a couple reasons.\n\nOne, as referenced by others, we don't have perfect information regarding intention.  The outcome is a good indication of the degree of culpability of the accused, especially when it comes to recklessness.  It's very hard to accurately gauge how reckless someone was being in hindsight, but we know someone has to be very reckless in order for their actions to result in a death.\n\nTwo, when someone has not actually caused harm to someone else, it can be more effective to provide a swift, minor penalty and a judicial admonition that they were merely lucky not to have killed someone, than to throw them in jail.

Do you not think there is a difference between speeding and hitting someone else, causing death. It's easy to speed 40 kph over the speed limit safely,  or endangering only yourself at most. An open highway, for example. If the driver of the speeding car did in fact cause the crash, then he was driving recklessly and endangering the lives of others, as is clearly shown by the fact that his negligence resulted in death. \n\nWhy is it that you think everybody who commits an act should be punished the same without regard for circumstances.  The law allows for varying punishment for a reason. Murder for example is different if you plotted to kill the person versus you walking in and finding them raping your daughter and killing out of rage. Same thing with attempted murder. Not all circumstances are the same. \n\nWhat if a person shoots a gun straight up in the air on their own property,  and they own hundreds or thousands of acres and know nobody else should be there? (Or what if they fire up in the air to scare someone instead of for shits and giggles,  per Vice President Biden's advice?) This is different from firing 20 rounds up in the air in the middle of a city. (Side note here, firing a gun straight up in the air cannot kill someone. It isn't possible).\n\nDo you not think there is a difference between a person c imitating an act who knows a certain outcome can or probably will happen versus someone who has no clue or bad intentions, but it happens anyway? We judge crimes by outcome often because some things aren't even a crime with certain outcomes. Homicide isn't a crime in self defense. Circumstances, and, as much as you may not like it, outcome, matter. What punishment would you want the driver to have if your most loved ones were the ones killed by his recklessness and willful disregard for life? Community service? I doubt it. The punishment should fit the crime, part of which is the outcome. In the U.S., that driver would have been charged with something similar to vehicular homicide, not just speeding. Most first world countries have a version of this which is significantly worse of a crime than speeding, and the punishment needs to fit THAT crime."}, {"id": "2n1hpm", "body": "The punishment should fit the crime, not the outcome of the crime.\n\nThis was inspired this post on the front page: [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2mzuxe/father_throws_chair_at_judge_after_the_driver/)\n\nThe judge sentences a driver to 120 hours of community service for running into a family and killing 3 people, and the father, whom I can't even imagine the sorrow and anguish he is going through, throws a chair at the judge.

I feel that judges already make plenty of \"outcome-independent\" rulings into this middle ground, and I don't think this Dutch case is considered \"groundbreaking\". There are already many cases in our existing justice system where sentencing is largely outcome-independent. It's actually relatively common, especially in \"accidents\" where there was minimal carelessness/negligence of the person held at fault. It's a sign our justice system is quite sophisticated (in my opinion). Regardless, often, such as in the Dutch case, people point to the outcome and consider the sentence unfair and unjust. They call for harsh sentences based solely on the outcome. \n\nRegardless of this fact, there aren't too many vigilante justice murders out there. I'm really not convinced you'd suddenly induce an epidemic of vigilante justice murders because of an attempt to rule even more outcome-independent than we do today. We're already \"most of the way there\".\n\n---\n\nAlternatively, consider how people, \"normal\" and \"extreme\", are dissatisfied with court rulings all the time for all kinds of reasons, but that doesn't mean there's many vigilante justice murders. They are incredibly uncommon.\n\nEven if you multiply the number of people dissatisfied with judgements by five due to switching to a more \"outcome-independent\" system, which is very generous given what I said in the last section about how my changes aren't even that extreme from what is already happening, you'd multiply the number of vigilante justice murders by five, which still leaves you with a very small number of vigilante justice murders."}, {"id": "2n1hpm", "body": "The punishment should fit the crime, not the outcome of the crime.\n\nThis was inspired this post on the front page: [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2mzuxe/father_throws_chair_at_judge_after_the_driver/)\n\nThe judge sentences a driver to 120 hours of community service for running into a family and killing 3 people, and the father, whom I can't even imagine the sorrow and anguish he is going through, throws a chair at the judge.

"}, {"id": "2n1hpm", "body": "The punishment should fit the crime, not the outcome of the crime.\n\nThis was inspired this post on the front page: [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2mzuxe/father_throws_chair_at_judge_after_the_driver/)\n\nThe judge sentences a driver to 120 hours of community service for running into a family and killing 3 people, and the father, whom I can't even imagine the sorrow and anguish he is going through, throws a chair at the judge. The driver was known to be going 40 km/hr over the limit. I hope the judge and security guards were sympathetic to the extreme emotions and sorrow in the father's head, and the punishment to him, if any, is minimal.\n\nRegardless, and I don't feel that I'm being insensitive: I believe the judge's sentence was reasonable. The crime was \"driving 40 km/hr over the limit\". The outcome of the crime was people died. The outcome of the crime should not affect the verdict. **If you say \"the driver should be put in jail for *blank* years!\" it's very reasonable to say that anyone caught going 40 km/hr over the limit should also be put in jail for *blank* years. They just got lucky and didn't drive into anyone; the crime is identical.** To do otherwise is to make the legal system more about vengeance than keeping society under control.\n\nAnother example: ever seen A Clockwork Orange? Alex, the main character, beat a lady very severely. He was arrested, and the police wanted to charge him with assault, which was a relatively common and minor charge in the hyper-violent society. It wasn't until she died that he was really in trouble with the law, and the cops told him this. In my opinion, Alex should have had one charge/punishment against him the whole time: \"assault and battery with a strong possibility of causing death\" (which is a theoretical crime I just made up) and he should have been convicted of it regardless of if the lady died.\n\nYou couldn't make it \"perfect\" so that every single crime is as outcome-independent as possible, especially because some crimes aren't even apparent until the outcome happens. However, I still think outcome-independence is a desirable aspect of a sophisticated legal system and something to strive for as much as possible.\n\n**EDIT:**  I feel that everyone is arguing that what I'm suggesting would cause drastic changes in the legal system, but I don't really feel that it would. Here's some of the changes that would be made by attempting to be more outcome independent:\n\nHere are some theoretical punishments in a modern justice system:\n\n* Murder: 25 years\n\n* Attempted murder: 15 years\n\n* Firing a gun straight up into the air causing death (involuntary manslaughter): 5 years\n\n* Firing a gun straight up into the air not causing death: Community service. Perhaps brief jail time.\n\nHere's how a \"outcome-independent\" legal system would treat things:\n\n* Murder: 25 years\n\n* Attempted murder: 25 years\n\n* Firing a gun straight up into the air causing death (involuntary manslaughter): Community service. Perhaps brief jail time.\n\n* Firing a gun straight up into the air not causing death: Community service. Perhaps brief jail time.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

What Zanzara is arguing is that from a legal perspective, two drivers who both negligently crash their vehicles should not be treated unequally based on what amounts to pure chance.  Because the actual behavior (*and* state of mind) of the drivers is the same, we shouldn't treat them unequally because one was unlucky enough to hit a pedestrian instead of a pole.  Especially in cases of negligence, the outcome of the crime is by nature so decoupled from the criminal act itself that punishments based on outcome are purely retributive in nature, with no direct deterrent effect (the punishment fits an inadvertent result, not the act you're actually trying to deter) and no basis in differing rehabilitation needs (the outcome is irrelevant to the criminal rehabilitation requirements of the drivers).\n\n&gt;Tons of people are reckless every day but they don't result in a social harm (e.g., people who spend their money recklessly.)\n\nDoes that recklessness present a cogent risk to others?  If not, it's irrelevant in the criminal context, because a crucial element of recklessness is the *foreseeability* of a negative outcome.  It's pretty obvious that speeding on snowy roads with low visibility presents a serious danger of a crash.  It's equally obvious that a bullet shot up into the air will eventually come down on something.  Because we expect people to understand the risk those actions represent, it's reasonable to sanction them even if they don't lead to harm because if left unsanctioned they will continue until they *do*.\n\nYou seem to be under the impression that Zanzara is suggesting all recklessness should be criminalized, and that all action should be treated under the law as though they had led to the worst possible outcome.  That's not the case.  Rather, he's saying that actions that would fit the *legal* requirements for outright negligent (or \"reckless\") behavior should be treated without respect to the (chance-driven) outcome.  The person who shot up into the air and *didn't* hit someone is treated harshly compared to the outcome, while the person who shot up into the air and *did* is treated comparatively leniently because neither of them are *truly* responsible for whether their bullet came down on a flowerbed or a dog-walker.  (To forestall the obvious, if they fired such a bullet into a desert, ocean or similar, they're equally free from liability.  It's foreseeable that a bullet fired in the city could come down on a bystander, but not that such a bystander would appear in the middle of the Sahara.  If the consequence was not foreseeable, the conduct is not reckless.)\n\n&gt;Not only would it congest the justice system with these now-criminalized states, but it would also treat people who recklessly spend their money as equal to people who recklessly spend others' money.\n\nThose are fundamentally different acts with different *potential* consequences.  Why would/should they be treated identically?\n\n&gt;Now it's restrained and bears a cogent relationship to the act, allowing people to tailor their behavior in a way that's law-abiding without crippling every day interactions.\n\nOn the contrary, it ceases to bear *any* cogent relationship to the act, because it's tethered to results which often hinge on factors entirely removed from the act itself.

Schools having structure their food budgets around the increased costs have produced low quality meals for students, though they are healthy. Point being, Obesity only runs rampant in the united states because legislature isn't there to deflate the cost of healthy alternatives.

Michele Obama was helping to push the new \"my plate\" food recommendations.   According to that at least half the plate should be fruit and veg.  I see no veggies on almost all of the trays.   \n\nI see lots of cheap processed food which usually tends to gave additives,  preservatives,  colorings, and flavorings -- not healthy. \n\n&gt; Obviously the reason for this is likely because real food is expensive compared to mass produced alternatives. \n\nThat.  And school cafeterias don't always agree with the experts on what isn't healthy.   They're still going by the same stupid guidelines that say catsup can be counted as a serving of vegetable?!\n\nIn America less healthy food is cheaper, partly because of the government.   [Why does salad cost more than a big mac?]( http://www.pcrm.org/good-medicine/2007/autumn/health-vs-pork-congress-debates-the-farm-bill).   \n\nAmerican culture also seems to somewhat accept fast food as healthy.   They say they want healthy but they eat burgers, sloppy joes, and chicken Wings (and with no fruit or veg).  I know people who think a McDonald's burger is healthy because because it has \"vegetables\" (one thin slice tomato, a lettuce leaf).  We need to get families to stop thinking processed chicken Mc nuggets and fruit flavor ice cream is a good meal. \n\n&gt; Point being, Obesity only runs rampant in the united states because legislature isn't there to deflate the cost of healthy alternatives. \n\nThe cause of obesity is not fully understood.  It's not as simple as calories in versus exercise.  Or as simple as fast food or not.   How much of the diet is stored as fat is influenced by genetics (eg. thrifty gene), hormones (eg. Leptin), stress level (cortisol), illness,  medications (such as some psych meds), proper thyroid and hypothalamus function,  sex hormone levels, and other triggers.  \n\nThere's also the question of how you measure obesity before declaring it's an epidemic.  Most of the \"epidemic\" announcements look at bmi.  Bmi isn't isn't a measure of body fat though.   It's merely a height weight ratio formula.   It doesn't differentiate between small build versus stocky.  It doesn't distinguish muscle versus fat.  The ranges of overweight and obese are arbitrarily assigned and don't take into account racial, gender, or age differences. \n\n&gt;  I certainly think that this disgusting alternative might trump obesity but only because nobody will eat it, in fact I'd go so far as to say it may **increase** obesity because kids will skip lunch and binge on their junk food at home. \n\nSo what you're saying is parents are too uneducated or too lazy to buy nutritious foods and limit junk food? \n\n\n&gt;  Also considering a large argument for the school lunch program is t that. hat it may give the under privileged student body \"One good meal a day\" It may no longer do that because they aren't going to eat it now.\n\nIf someone truly has no food at home, they're not going to skip a free hot meal.    A person has to eat. \n\nWho knows why kids don't eat their lunches?  Had anyone studied this?  The pics you gave as examples seem less disgusting then the food I had as a kid.   Back then we didn't expect to have many choices.  Either we ate it or we were hungry.    Our parents were responsible enough not to fill the kitchen with junk food, but then again I'm older than most redditors and I lived in an age where we didn't get take out or eat out.  Culture has changed.  Now fast food places are open 24 hours.  Parents take their kids out a few times a week.  Kids are taught that a fast food cheeseburger is a \"healthy\" normal good meal.  And now instead of getting exercise playing outside,  many kids just sit in front of a tv, computer,  or video game.

It does more or less boil down to people consuming too many calories, but we don't know precisely why they are doing this. \n\nOne plausible reason actually goes against your point here, though.  Congress has  heavily subsidized corn production, and continues to do so to some extent.  This is why food in the US frequently contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, and lots of it - because congress has made it cheap.  As a result, people's calorie consumption could have gone up, resulting in obesity. \n\nSo it's maybe not that they don't subsidize healthy stuff, it's that they DO subsidize unhealthy stuff.

Many jars are going to be opened by people with smaller hands; the wider the mouth of the jar is, the more trouble small-handed people will have getting a stubborn lid loose. Having a smaller surface area for lids will also likely reduce costs by a few cents per product which will translate exponentially to the cost for the consumer.\n\nSecond: One piece vs two. There are a few parts to this, actually. Construction is simpler, which may affect cost or labor in production. When you open a jar of pasta sauce, you typically put the lid down somewhere while you use the sauce. With a mason jar lid, there is no lip to protect the surface that touches the product if you accidentally place it the wrong way. This also makes it easier for sauce to get on whatever surface you place the lid on. Having two pieces takes longer to take off as well as put back on. It's a small inconvenience, but one nonetheless. The final point about having two pieces is that it's easier to misplace two pieces than one. \n\nWhether you're talking about peanut butter, jelly, pasta sauce, or maraschino cherries, there's another thing to be considered: kids. Kids  validate every aspect of the first two points I've made.

We have recently been reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. For those who have not read it or know only general plot points, the book satirizes white, southern society in pre-civil war America, pointing out the contradictions accepted as fact by many of the whites of the era. \n\nDuring our reading of Huck Finn, we have been given 2 quizzes, the first covering chapters 1-15 and the second covering chapters 16-31. The quizzes are essentially split between fact-based questions on plot points and critical-reading-based questions that require an argument supported with evidence. I'm angry right now (after having taken the 2^nd quiz earlier today) because the fact-based questions seem to be designed to be difficult, and only focus on unimportant and minute details. This type of question also accounted for half of the possible points on each quiz.\n\nOn the first quiz, there was a section that required you to match characters with their descriptions. Rather than describe the characters in terms of their role in the book, or what they represent in their society, the questions described the characters in reference to another character, in the context of an unimportant event in the book. For example, Jim, the second most important character in the book behind Huck himself, is a runaway slave that travels with Huck throughout the book. Rather than describe him as that, his description was *\"has his hat hung on a tree by Tom Sawyer.\"* While that is an accurate description of Jim, the event described does not serve any important purpose to the book. \n\nSimilarly, the second quiz featured 8 fact-based, short answer questions, 6 of which had to be answered. Number 6 asked, *\"how does the King justify his incorrect use of the word obsequies?\"* Again, this small detail does not hold any real significance in the book. My teacher has justified this type of detail-oriented question before, claiming that she wants to reward the kids that read the book for reading the book. However, having read the book myself, and having taken notes and read online guides to further clarify the book, I still could not answer this question, because as I was reading I figured that such a small detail couldn't possibly matter enough to write down. \n\nThe questions that focus on what Twain was really saying with Huck Finn such as *\"What is Twain satirizing with the character of Doctor Robinson?\"* are weighted equally with the previously mentioned questions. Thus, a student that comes away from the book not remembering any details and only knowing the metaphors and satirical elements Twain creates (which is the only part of Huck Finn that really matters) would have gotten a 50% on the test. The county I live in has a \"50% rule\", which allows students to automatically get half-credit on anything for attempting it. Thus, students that understand the book perfectly and students that didn't read it at all receive the same grade on the quizzes in my class. **This is why I'm angry: by focusing on what actually matters when reading Huck Finn, my teacher is essentially telling me I might as well have not read the book at all.** \n\nChange my view, before I complain to my teacher.

The quizzes are essentially split between fact-based questions on plot points and critical-reading-based questions that require an argument supported with evidence. I'm angry right now (after having taken the 2^nd quiz earlier today) because the fact-based questions seem to be designed to be difficult, and only focus on unimportant and minute details. This type of question also accounted for half of the possible points on each quiz.\n\nOn the first quiz, there was a section that required you to match characters with their descriptions. Rather than describe the characters in terms of their role in the book, or what they represent in their society, the questions described the characters in reference to another character, in the context of an unimportant event in the book. For example, Jim, the second most important character in the book behind Huck himself, is a runaway slave that travels with Huck throughout the book. Rather than describe him as that, his description was *\"has his hat hung on a tree by Tom Sawyer.\"* While that is an accurate description of Jim, the event described does not serve any important purpose to the book. \n\nSimilarly, the second quiz featured 8 fact-based, short answer questions, 6 of which had to be answered. Number 6 asked, *\"how does the King justify his incorrect use of the word obsequies?\"* Again, this small detail does not hold any real significance in the book. My teacher has justified this type of detail-oriented question before, claiming that she wants to reward the kids that read the book for reading the book. However, having read the book myself, and having taken notes and read online guides to further clarify the book, I still could not answer this question, because as I was reading I figured that such a small detail couldn't possibly matter enough to write down. \n\nThe questions that focus on what Twain was really saying with Huck Finn such as *\"What is Twain satirizing with the character of Doctor Robinson?\"* are weighted equally with the previously mentioned questions.

I'm on mobile. I'm pretty much exclusively referencing the wiki articles on free speech zones and student rights, along with some court cases linked therein. I am obviously not an expert. Only experience with law is a high school course in con law, 9 credits in undergrad law intro courses, and a year of living with a whole bunch of law students.*\n\nBefore I begin, let me clarify a few things. I do not support free speech zones. I agree that demonstrations, student or otherwise, should not be confined to designated zones. But you don't seem to fully understand the issue at hand. \n\nMany people get confused about how constitutional rights work. The U.S. Constitution is considered a \"living document\". Amendments require 2/3 of the legislative branch to pass, but the practical application and specific interpretation of the constitution is continuously evolving via precedent. Restrictions on speech are not necessarily unconstitutional. Law =/= ethics/morals/beliefs. \n\nMy business law prof got this point across really well. I won't bother you with the full story. But basically before introducing himself, he said this:\n\n&gt;This is business law. This is not business ethics. We will not be discussing how things should be. We will be discussing how they are. The rationale for many laws is not always intuitive. It is not always morally right. But it doesn't matter if you agree with the law. \n\n(He also casually threw out a bible and ruffled some feathers. But that's not relevant.)\n\nThe problem you seem to be having is that you see a problem, but don't understand the nature of it. Free speech zones are not legally a constitutional issue of universities alone. The US Supreme Court holds that the government may regulate the Time, Place, and Manner of public speech as long as the regulations are \"neutral with respect to content, narrowly drawn, serve a significant government interest, and leave open alternative channels of communication\". This rationale was used to create free speech zones during the Bush administration a lot. \n\nMany free speech zones on campuses date back to the Vietnam War protests. And many schools have done away with them since then. But not all. That is because they are not legally considered to violate the first amendment. \n\nStudents at public universities already have their constitutional rights protected as much as anyone else. Universities can not require students to sign away their rights as a condition of enrollment. So dorm searches and free speech are already protected as much as anywhere else. (With some exceptions and issues.)\n\nSo public universities are not disregarding the first amendment. Unless the Supreme Court decides free speech zones are unconstitutional, they are disregarding nothing legally. If they are deemed unconstitutional elsewhere, then universities will be compelled to comply just like everywhere else.

It is the combination of not knowing how to get money, how to keep money, how to use money, and how to get advice about money (and otherwise take care of yourself as an adult) that is the true nature of poverty.  \n\nOn today's Reddit front page is [this story](http://fox6now.com/2014/11/18/the-money-is-gone-teary-mugshot-drew-114k-in-donations-but-prosecutors-have-taken-back-their-deal/) about a woman who received national fame for leaving her kids in a hot car while she went for a job interview.  She received widespread sympathy for having to make, apparently, a Hobson's choice between leaving her kids alone to get employment, or supervising her kids and foregoing an income.   She received a total of $114k in donations, and an offer from the prosecutor to go free if she saved $40k of it in a trust for the kids.   She has already spent the money with nothing left.  \n\nOf course, this feeds directly into conservative \"prosperity theology\" that rich people are rich because they deserve it (they are good people), and poor people are poor because they don't deserve it (they are bad people).  \n\nI think it is indeterminate whether this woman is \"good\" or \"bad\".   But I cannot imagine that she didn't understand her freedom was at sake here.  Even a selfish person would want their freedom.  It seems to me to be clear that she just didn't have any idea how to save money.  Saving money is not a one-time act.  It is a life skill that she probably never learned, and this woman possibly didn't even know she needed to acquire.   Without knowing this, she was doomed.   Likely, others in poverty similar to her are similarly doomed.  Her moral character -- their moral character -- is not the overriding factor. \n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone for the discussion.  It has helped me clarify some points in my own mind and understand this issue somewhat better.   \n\nSo far, my view has not changed very much.  /u/raychilloh emphasized that the prosecutor did give Shanesha Taylor a single, apparently specific, somewhat straightforward task: to \"save\" $40,000 of the money for her children.  In my view, she probably didn't understand (or fully understand) *why* anyone would want to do that (how/when would her children use the money?).  Possibly she did not understand how to do it, but could probably have figured it out if she tried.  But it is difficult to explain her lack of action on this element in any way that is not at least tainted by some moral failing that exacerbated her handicap in not understanding money.  Her failure in this regard does (very) slightly change my view. \n\nOf possible interest: I also posted [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_of_Fortune_%282005_film%29) about a very similar outcome in a very similar situation.  A documentary filmmaker, as an experiment, gave $100k cash to a random homeless man (who was neither crazy nor on drugs) and then documented how he made terrible decisions with the money until it was gone. I have not seen the film. \n\nNext, I would like to highlight a comment from /u/ShaulaTheCat that is [buried pretty deep down](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2n05gn/cmv_i_believe_the_shanesha_taylor_story/cm9by4y).  It cites a source that says Shanesha Taylor only got three job offers, and none of them would fully support her financial needs.  She (perhaps wrongly) thought they would not ultimately affect her financial situation.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think that learning how to handle money like a non-poor person (e.g. having a disposable income that can be saved, and not being penalized for saving, and then proceeding to save and invest) is something most people -- including most poor people -- are indeed intellectually and emotionally capable of learning.   I think the missing ingredient is not desire or internal capacity, but the fact that learning how money works is something that generally takes time, experience, practice, and exposure to good instruction/advice.  What I am reacting to most in this story (which is similar to the documentary I linked to in the edit) is the presumption that if you just throw 100k at a poor person they should already have most of what they need to recover, so long as they have the will.   I think that is a mistaken view.  I think financial literacy is not a simple matter, similar to how ordinary literacy is not a simple matter (though it is not a perfect analogy).    Can an illiterate person learn to read if they try?  Of course they can, given time and assistance.   But the biggest barrier an illiterate person has to communicating with the world is not the lack of a word processor and a g-mail account.  Nor is it the will to learn.  It is the fact that they haven't already learned,  Being dumped head-first into the world of the literate cannot be expected to go well, despite that will and (long-term) ability.

This [Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/11/17/1345430/-Good-for-Shanesha-Taylor-for-standing-up-to-Co-Atty-Bill-Montgomery-trying-to-seize-her-donations) article has a statement from her about halfway down the page that explains the rationale for some of her actions. It's pretty biased, but makes some good points, including that the donations were going to be taxed. Here a couple of key sections:\n\n&gt; I was not allowed to visit my children for two months which meant that my family had to obtain expensive child care. **I owed them for expenditures, back car payments, but I did set up a house, paying first, last, deposit and one year\u2019s rent ($14522.45). Mandated court classes/counseling have cost me $3,600 plus childcare. I bought clothing, food for 20 weeks for the four of us and some modest furniture needed to set up my household. I have paid utilities for four months and need to have adequate amounts in reserve.** If I lock myself out of what I have left, I will be back to living in my car in a matter of months. **I am off government assistance so it is necessary for me to be careful with every dime.** I have been offered three jobs recently that are not viable options. The first two were part time positions requiring nights and weekends. I do not have a reliable sitter at this time outside of normal child daycare center hours. Part time wages would not cover  the daycare, the transportation and sustain the household. I\u2019ve even attempted two part time jobs but the schedules just would not coincide. I was offered a full time position from 6am to 2pm. The company was l-l/2 hours east of my home. This would add approximately $600 month in gas if I commuted that far. My daycare hours are 6am to 6pm. The position would require the need for someone to be available for the children every morning at 4 am. I don\u2019t have any one available to do that. I am uncomfortable being that far away as emergencies do come up and the day care centers do not keep sick children on the premises. With CPS watching over my shoulder, working nights, week-ends or l-l/2 hours a way is not at all in the interest of my family. With all the bad press including libel and slander without a grain of truth by my \u201cdefense team\u201d and the County Attorney, I am losing hope that I will ever get a job. The almost daily classes have taken up a lot of time, gas going to and fro, I\u2019ve spent $3,600 on court mandated classes, tests, counseling but faithfully completed 20 weeks\u2019 worth. This does not include child care. No employer would tolerate this many hours away from the job spent on this mandated program. \n\nAgain, overall the Daily Kos article is rather biased, but I think this is a case where the criminal justice system has made it extremely difficult for someone in poverty to rebound. If she put the $40,000 in a trust fund, she might have gone back into debt, but if she didn't, she was facing felony charges. Seems a bit harsh for a first time offender: felony charges make it very difficult to find employment.\n\nSeems to me that poor people don't get the benefit of doubt, and have less resources to fight back against state institutions that often don't have their best interests in mind."}, {"id": "2n05gn", "body": "That is to say, not having money is merely the *symptom* of poverty.

The overwhelming majority of women would rather have a guy who's average sized or bigger than a smaller than average.  \n\nI doubt you could change my view, but if you could you would change my life and many others. I would be eternally grateful. \n\n"}, {"id": "cm9d87s", "body": "I dates a guy with a smaller penis than yours.   It wouldn't have been a big deal but he make it (and anything else he didn't like about himself a big deal).  He was negative.  He didn't believe me when I said I cared for him.   His insecurity ran so deep he wouldn't trust me.   THAT is what destroys a promising relationship. \n\nSince then I've been with a variety of sizes from average to above average.   How much I liked them was not directly correlated to how many inches they had.   There is a lot of truth to the saying \"it's not what you have, it's how you use it\".  There are also some men who are completely self centered and wouldn't notice or care if their partner is satisfied.  There are some who just treat a woman like crap, and I don't care how great sex is, I'm not putting up with that.\n\nBottom line: there are many many traits women look for in a man.  I don't think penis size is all that important; sexual satisfaction is what the real goal is.   And it definitely doesn't matter if penis size is larger or not when the man is so obsessed with his penis and his insecure about it;  that's the real turn off. "}, {"id": "2n030n", "body": "Small as in below 5\". Average being 5.5\"-6\" and hung to 7\"+.\n\nThe reason I believe this is because I'm a man who has a small penis. I've had sex, and studied up on sex. I've attempted to fool around and with 5 different women. 5 very different women. They all rejected me because my penis too small. Some didn't say so but I knew. Always pulling the fade on me after sex.I learned from my mistakes in my first encounter and started learning about oral and fingering as if I was going to be graded on it. It worked in getting her off but even then the aesthetic of a small penis is a mood killer apparently. They always made this face of disappointment whenever I pulled my pants down. They always act so bored when they fucked me.  If you want to know my full experience you can read it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25mirp/size_does_matter/). It's depressing but read at your own risk. I can't even read it myself. \n\nI hold this view is because from my experiences and other people's experiences, with people of the same size and smaller, women can be cruel even if unintentionally. There are many more stories from other people which I will be happy to find for you. It's always the same story. Rejection ,cheating.\"settling\", and an open relationship. Some people have suggested that I force myself into small penis humiliation fetish and a cuckold fetish. It just further proves that people don't think I'm man enough to be with a woman. \n\nWhile some women don't apparently care about size (which really translates to average is fine, but bigger is better) , it still sucks to know that my penis does nothing for her. My penis is apart of me and makes me what I am, and when I hear someone say \"you don't need a dick to satisfy\" they simply do not get the full picture. I'd like to know that my penis feels good for someone. My favorite is the \"lesbians get off without penises, you're fine\". I can't help but think those people are idiots.\n\nSome women say they prefer smaller. When I ask what that means they usually say 5\"-6\". I can't help but laugh at those responses. It's either you're huge or small. I happen to be very small. Some even say girth matters more. That does absolutely nothing for most people who face my problems. Most small dicks are proportionate. I'm fucked with 4\" length and 4.5\" girth. \n\nI think the equivalent to \"size does not matter\" would be telling a girl that you're with her for her personality and not for her looks despite her knowing that she's unattractive. It's just not the same. Or for instance when people suggest a penis sheath (penis extender) it's the equivalent of putting a mask over a woman's face because it makes sex better for the guy since the woman's face on it's own won't cut it. As a woman I would feel insulted. \n\nYou should all know about the stigma of small dicks in media. How those men are perceived less as a man and as more pathetic. How all porn is about big dicks while the smaller ones are about humiliation. How women have a fetishes for a big dicks and actually sleep with someone based on the notion that a guy is hung.

I doubt it.\n\nAnd I think you're generalizations are what's preventing you from seeing other sides. You've had sex with 5 women. There are 3.5 billion women on this planet. You've had encounters with .000000000014% of the population.\n\nThere are people out there who actually prefer smaller penises for various reasons. They're easier to deal with in foreplay. Some women have shallow vaginas and taking more than 4 inches could be painful. And there are a lot more people who legitimately don't care. You've got a 4 incher. That's actually pretty good compared to micropenises, and guys with micropenises still manage to have successful relations.\n\n&gt;The overwhelming majority of women would rather have a guy who's average sized or bigger than a smaller than average.\n\nI'd really need to see a source on this for me to take it seriously.

It's a stupid stigma, but it does exist, and that sucks. But everyone has to deal with their own stigmas and imperfections. The media also says that women need large asses and big boobs, but a whole lot of women don't. It says men need to be tall and muscular and lean, but, again, a ton of guys aren't. Does the media saying it make these things matter? Perhaps to some people, but I think the majority of people are smart enough to realize that these things are (literally) only skin deep and that there's a lot more to people and sex than just aesthetics.\n\n&gt;I doubt you could change my view, but if you could you would change my life and many others.

That feeling that your penis size is 'inadequate' (justified or not) is any of the listed male/female insecurities times one thousand. It is incredibly soul crushing and depressing. It was instilled in us that manliness = big (or at least big enough) penis, a real man is expected to get off a woman just by putting it in and thrusting for a time (of course real men last as long as they want too, or if not, at least a few hours, can get it up again and again after climaxing etc. etc.)\nIt's not \"shallowness\" all cultures in history attributed a central place to penis size in judging manliness (some cultures regarded big penises unaesthetical but that doesn't mean they prefered small ones in real life).\nSo.. it's perfectly understandable and justified if a man with a small penis is depressed, has suicidal thoughts etc. After all he has heard and read it hundreds of times in his life from women and men alike that how useless/undesirable/pathetic men with smallish dicks are (And if a guy is an arrogant asshole, then he must be compensating for his tiny dick obviously). Sometimes not so directly, but the message is clear then too. A small dick is a huge turn off, is unsuitable to pleasure a woman (she probably feels nothing when it's inside her) and is laughing stock.\n"}, {"id": "2n030n", "body": "Small as in below 5\".

I'll readily admit that about 30% of women I've been with - out of about 30 women who I've fucked and many more who have seen/felt it - really do prefer huge dicks. And a small percentage of women - like 1-2% - REALLY love huge dicks and require them. But, that still leaves about 70% who either prefer average or small or have no preference whatsoever. A lot of the no preference ones looked just as bored having sex with my huge cock unless I worked REALLY HARD to get her into it mentally. So that's probably your shortcoming with most women - you're assuming that dick size is what causes them to not enjoy it, when it's more likely either your lack of confidence or skill or ability to create attraction. Sorry if that comes off rude, but at least those are all things within your control, unlike dick size. \n\nAnd as far as the physical limitations of a small penis go, I can promise you that, from experience, length isn't very important. It's a fact that you might not be able to give every women an a-spot orgasm with less than 6 inches, but not every woman can have an a-spot orgasm anyway. And not every women likes the painful feeling of being hit hard and deep. And I'm very thick too, so that might have something to do with it, but I've been able to make a couple of girls cum (by getting into their heads first!) with only half my dick inside them.

It does, that's reality.\nFull disclosure: I used to frequent /r/smalldickproblems too, I'm almost the same size as you claim having. A little bit longer but even more thinner (girth is more important so I'd happily change places with ya), I measure around 4.5\" length (or at least under 5\" a bit, 11.5-12 cm) and around 4\" girth (not much more than 3 cm in diameter on the shaft, about as thick as my index and middle finger together and I have small hands for a guy). I understand your feelings totally. It really does eat your soul away. I can't offer a magical solution for us, it sucks, suck it up, get over it and live life as you can. It could be even worse (micropenis). That's not much for a consolation I know. Don't allow yourself to wallow in self-pity (I know you say you don't). There are other things in life than penis size or even sex (but you don't have to give up on it), we are disadvantaged, that's hard to accept but we cannot do anything about it beyond trying to be great lovers in all other possible ways. And yes, that is not enough for most women who are sex-oriented, promiscuos and have plenty of options. We aren't going to become irresistible pussy slayers, this is the truth. Maybe some women will gossip about you and laugh, if you let them know by having sex with them. That's the price of it, you can choose celibacy or having sex just with prostitutes too. The only sound advice I can think about is that you mustn't allow it to define you, chase negative thoughts away as you can. Of course you can't succeed completely in that, I know.\nAlso one advice that I read many years ago on penissizedebate.com for guys with small dicks: don't get obsessed about satisfying your partner, be selfish (we won't ever be able to provide the same experience as a well hung guy no matters how hard we tried) and put your enjoyment at the first place.

For one many city and county roads are funded primarily through non-user fees such as property taxes. User fees, including gasoline taxes, automobile registration fees and road tolls, do not cover the cost of road construction and maintenance in the United States. In 2007, only 51% of the $193 billion set aside for highway construction and maintenance came from such user fees, the remainder consisting of non-user fees such as income, sales and property taxes, and bond issues. Even if they do not own a car, cyclists who pay taxes contribute substantially to the nation\u2019s highway funds.\n\n\nMany frequent cyclists also own one or more cars, and therefore pay registration fees and often gasoline taxes and tolls. A car owner who chooses to ride a bicycle is, in essence, only utilizing a fraction of the infrastructure that he or she has \"paid for\". Bicycles are already prohibited from Interstate and many federal highways, nearly all urban cycling takes place on these local roads, built and maintained with little or no revenue from car-specific fees. Bicycles inflict a negligible amount of damage to roads and other infrastructure compared with cars, buses or trucks, reducing the need for maintenance. Coupled with the relatively narrow share of physical roadway required by a bicycle, cycling effectively reduces the cost of road construction and maintenance for governments when it replaces car travel."}, {"id": "2mzyb2", "body": "I'm in the US\n\n- licenses should not have to be required for residential zones.

Fuck you, I'm anal like that. \n\nLicensing does not automatically mean the overall rate of law-breaking will go down. Just think about how many people in cars and motorcycles break traffic laws despite both of those vehicles requiring a license to operate. Cyclists are already expected to obey traffic laws, and those that do not are already subject to consequences if caught. Why do you think the 60% of cyclists that you observe breaking the law are going to stop just because they have a license?\n\n&gt; there should be visible plates and tags. This should help pay for road improvements to ensure they have a safe lane. \n\nMore tax money does not necessarily mean more/better improvements. Where I live, there are essentially no bike lanes, and the infrastructure for cyclists is horrible. Why should my tag/title fees as a cyclist go towards maintaining roads that are created with only cars in mind? Also, I am already paying for road improvements through other taxes I pay; it's not like I am not contributing anything to road maintenance just because I ride a bike. \n\nAnother point: cars can go on highways, whereas bikes cannot (for good reasons). It makes more sense for car drivers to pay more in road maintenance than cyclists because, well, cars are allowed on more kinds of roads than bikes are. Cars also damage the roads more than bikes do and thus it makes more sense that car drivers should shoulder more of the repair and construction costs than.\n\nAs an aside, while I get the point of licensing for cars, I still don't agree with title and tag fees even for cars. It affects poor people more heavily than other economic classes and just seems like bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake. This is, in fact, one of the reasons riding a bike can preferable to driving a car: less bureaucratic bullshit.\n\n&gt; licensing for bikes should mirror licensing for cars. Consequences should be the same. Requirements should be the same. \n\nThis argument does not hold up very well when you start to compare the risks of operating a car vs operating a bike. Cyclists who do not follow the laws and drive recklessly generally put themselves in the greatest danger whereas reckless motorists put everyone around them in danger in addition to themselves. For instance, if a cyclist does not stop at a stop sign and hits a person in a car, the person in the car will be fine whereas the cyclist is at least somewhat hurt if not injured. However, if a car driver does not stop at a stop sign and hits someone on a bike, the car driver is fine (at least physically) whereas the cyclist is seriously injured or possibly dead. Cars go faster, have larger blind spots, weigh more, and carry more people than bikes do; hence, there is much more at risk when a motorist is not capable of controlling a motorized vehicle than when a cyclist is unable to control a bicycle. This greater risk involved in operating a car entails a greater responsibility and hence more restrictions over who has the privilege to operate a car, resulting in a difference in license requirements for cyclists and motorists. The very fact that even young kids can learn to ride a bike whereas you have to be at least 15 or 16 to learn how to drive a car reveals the difference in risk involved in these two modes of transit.\n\nAlso, in the US, there are more cars on the road than bikes and people in cars kill/injure cyclists at much greater rates than cyclists kill/injure motorists. Because cars are much more ubiquitous and deadly than bikes, it makes much more sense for cars to require licensing and insurance while bikes are exempt.\n\n&gt; licenses should not have to be required for residential zones. Residential zones should be a safe zone to have children play\n\nThis opens the floodgates for all sorts of questions. Do I need a license if I ride my bike exclusively on the sidewalk? Do I need a license if I am riding my bike on a bike path where there are no cars? Do I need a license if I am a mountain biker who rides on dirt paths that allow off-road vehicles? Do I need a license if I am a racing cyclist who only rides in races and practice runs? Do I need a license if I ride on the velodrome (bike track) where there are no cars but can still be a dangerous environment? \n\nPart of the reason bike aren't licensed is because they are ridden in a variety of places in a variety of ways, whereas cars are generally only driven in prescribed traffic areas in a limited way.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure someone will come along and say all these things in a much more cohesive and elegant way than I just did; I simply wanted to get the conversation flowing a bit."}, {"id": "2mzyb2", "body": "I'm in the US\n\n- licenses should not have to be required for residential zones.
