For example, if someone with cardiac issues attacks me and I punch them back, causing their heart to stop, I would likely be charged with 2nd degree murder.  \n\nAlso, knowing that if you punch someone, you might be killed is really a great deterrent. Today, there is a sizable population that would fight people without their victim showing any malice against them. People will fight for relationships, money, sex, and many other things. I think that self-preservation of one's life will trump all of these reasons. For people that do not have self-control and refuse to isolate themselves, it would be doing society a favor to murder them in self-defence.  \nEdit 1:  \nSorry for the ambiguity. I think that after the incident is done, self-defense should not be an excuse to kill them.

I love words and poetry has never been my favorite. After reading the entire OP I'd reconsidered. Poetry isn't my thing. I enjoy finding the beauty in larger pieces which often require supporting passages that lead up to great things but I suppose others could prefer the condensed forms.\n\nMore words are not always better. If an idea can be conveyed briefly then more words will make it muddier as easily as make it clearer. Even the clearest water blocks light if it's deep enough. I'd love to expand on that point but those words already express my point in a manner I believe to be clear and unambiguous. I'd make the point again in a different way but if I do it differently it may create a dissonance that reduces clarity. I will continue on the topic of poetry in particular however.\n\nBecause I've never been interested in poetry I haven't paid much attention to the definition. It's not all cadence and rhyming. I don't care for that much. When I appreciate words it's for their meaning and the thoughts they provoke (maybe this is one reason I dislike dad jokes). I would describe short, profound things that stand alone as poetry. Amablue's comment would qualify. Sometimes short passages of a novel are poetic but they get part of their value from the story around them. They are improved by their inclusion in a larger work. Is it not possible that shorter poetry could be similarly moving without the additional words around it? The practical benefit of not having to read as much alone could be an argument in favor of poetry. If I spend an hour reading and find two beautiful moments in literature is this still better than reading three beautiful poems in the same time? Is the maximum magnitude of longer literature larger? Can the words of shorter work not be supported by other means such as the common experiences we share throughout our lives?\n\n[](/twiveryyes)"}, {"id": "cm1nl8r", "body": "We have deemed all these words necessary in order to explain that we have been traveling more slowly than was predicted, concision is not a definitive virtue, on occasion one loses out by talking too much, it is true, but how much has also been gained by saying more than was strictly necessary."}, {"id": "cm234y7", "body": "TL;DR\n\nShort n' sweet."}, {"id": "cm1nl8r", "body": "We have deemed all these words necessary in order to explain that we have been traveling more slowly than was predicted, concision is not a definitive virtue, on occasion one loses out by talking too much, it is true, but how much has also been gained by saying more than was strictly necessary."}, {"id": "cm1owzd", "body": "Not much.

This is simply a disclaimer so that I don't need to use them differently.\n\nI've often seen it put forward that novels are simply word-vomit, whereas poetry is the refinement of a carefully selected set of words. This implies a lot of things about literature that I disagree with: 1) that literature is not as refined as poetry, 2) that the standards for literature are lower than for poetry, and 3) the impact of poetry is greater than that of literature upon the reader.\n\nPerhaps I could go through all my favourite books and point out passages that I believe are so poetic that they show literature is as refined as poetry. That wouldn't really prove anything though, because the instant response would be to bring up every part I didn't mention, for they must be less refined. This would be a fallacy; while poetry has more relatively meaningful lines, in literature the 'glue' must exist to hold all the elements of the story together. If you never wrote \"John said.\" you wouldn't necessarily have a better work, just one that subverts the most common conventions of writing, something which I believe we can agree doesn't determine whether a work is good or bad, but is simply a small factor in that decision.\n\nThe standards of good writing have never been higher, for we have never had a larger selection to choose from. I don't know the poetry industry well enough to make any statements about it, but from what I've heard it's also facing the same belt-tightening that novel publishing is. Unless a given work appeals to the human side of the editors/publishers in some way there is a low chance that it will make it past the slush pile. In this one facet I can see poetry having an edge, because it is shorter and can theoretically be consumed faster, making more room for works; but at the same time, an account of the meaning within a poem could deserve twice the time of some pulp romance novels. \n\nEven beyond this supposed even point, standards have become more nebulous, conceptually, than they once were. Cummings (and presumably many others) brought non-grammatical writings to poetry, but is the uneducated opening of \"Flowers for Algernon\" any different? Style is entirely dictated by a number of internal and external factors that never stop changing, while the completed work is static forever afterwards. Shakespeare was once considered the king of playwrights (citation needed) but now if you took his name off the cover of a modernized version people would complain of how trite his works are. The ever-changing nature of standards makes me laugh when people say this pulp novel is qualitatively worse than that sonnet, because they tend to rely on far more judgmental assumptions than they explain. If all the world's writers and readers haven't yet come to a conclusion on what good writing is, I don't see the validity in a claim that any entire mode of writing can be superior or inferior to another.\n\nMy last problem is about the impact of a work on a reader. This is more subjective grounds than the other two, I think, and this could be the one I'm least sure of. Some people make a big point of *minimalism*, the ability to evoke from an audience with a minimum of material. Generally, poetry is more minimal than literature in every way. This is due to the general constructs which each use to evoke from the reader, where poetry uses tight prose and emphasizes imagery, while novels use narration, to build the intended mental image. But nothing about the feelings a reader feels is defined by the amount of words or metaphors it took to create them, and any limit placed thereby is a false restriction. I could argue that not having limitations of form gives literature *more* variability, that the freedom of it gives superior room for creativity, but in that sense there exists poetry that breaks those rules too (free-form). So, while literature isn't necessarily better than poetry just because of freedom of expression, poetry is certainly not better than literature because of its spartan format. \n\nMaybe you've read all this, and you're wondering: \"Where is the proof that literature can do it better?!\" Yes, my points have only argued that literature is not inherently worse, but this is an important part of the overarching idea. I think the strongest evidence I can present for the superiority of literature is simple. By explication all the subtlest themes of poetry can be expanded and alluded to and improved upon. Anything that is said in one sentence will be improved in every qualitative way by expansion. Nothing is ever expressed better in less words than in more. If you believe you can convince me otherwise of this, then feel free. I'd love to see more value in poetry than I already do.\n\ntl;dr longer = more expression = better. I wrote an essay on why short works aren't better than long ones and here you are reading the summary.\n\n(P.S.: I've got some cognitive reasons for why I think literature is better too but science is slow and it's pretty hard to argue about the 'general function' of brains when they're good enough to do anything we need anyway)\n\nEdit: I've read every post, but there are too many things I didn't respond to. Wasn't expecting as big of a discussion to form. I'm happy though; my mind was changed in ways, I've learned a lot more perspectives on the topic than I previously had, and this is the healthiest dissection of 'value' in writing I've read in a long time.

Or that series of books that was all written as text messages or IMs or tweets or whatever. Self-publishing and growing markets mean more garbage gets out there than ever before. Publishers greenlight what sells, not what is a literary masterpiece, and if the consumers are looking for pulp fiction that's what gets published. \n\n&gt;Even beyond this supposed even point, standards have become more nebulous, conceptually, than they once were.

Style is entirely dictated by a number of internal and external factors that never stop changing, while the completed work is static forever afterwards. Shakespeare was once considered the king of playwrights (citation needed) but now if you took his name off the cover of a modernized version people would complain of how trite his works are. The ever-changing nature of standards makes me laugh when people say this pulp novel is qualitatively worse than that sonnet, because they tend to rely on far more judgmental assumptions than they explain.

What you're saying is equivalent to \"I like sculpture better than painting.\" \n\nIn prose, directness of language is tantamount. The point is the story. In poetry, there is room to introduce more style and figurative language. The point of poetry is to convey the human significance of the subject matter concisely and beautifully. It could convey a story, but it doesn't need to. Quite a few poems convey a moment, raw perception of sensual stimuli, or an abstract thought. \n\nThe most important thing to understand is that poetry cannot be translated into prose. Some significance is always lost in the process. Similarly, you can't condense good prose into poetry without losing something.\n\nYou have asked, how is this so? How does expanding on an idea cause it to lose value? It's a good question. Bare in mind, though, that the average poem can be read in a matter of seconds or minutes. The brevity of it allows the reader to comprehend the entirety of the subject matter in a matter of moments. This allows for a more immediate and intuitive emotional impact to the subject matter. It is less cerebral in this sense. It depends largely on feeling as opposed to understanding, which means it is open to a wider array of interpretation. In this way, the reader is forced to do the thinking himself. So, one could say that poetry is *speculative*; it pushes language to its limits and begs for interpretation. It is very difficult for prose to have that quality, and when it does, it borders on being prose poetry.\n\nThe poem \"Metaphor,\" by my favorite poet, Franz Wright, demonstrates this point exactly. \n\n    Then the point comes\n    when language decides\n    to start strangling itself\n    on its leash, make a break for it\n    or to turn on you\u2014\n    no longer the mournful\n    appearing, intelligent\n    and silent being who guided you\n    in a dark world.\n\nI don't care how good you are at conveying ideas in prose, you would never be able to precisely convey Wright's point. You could write a whole book about the nature of metaphor and not have the same impact as this poem. That's not because poetry is better than prose, but because they are simply not the same thing.\n\nWhether you prefer one or the other is besides the point. Prose and poetry are distinct art forms.

I don't even know how to refute this except that it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Each piece of art stands on its own merits. Refinement varies accordingly.\n\n&gt;2) that the standards for literature are lower than for poetry\n\nEveryone has their own standards for each medium. Be it television, painting, literature, poetry, etc. This is also gibberish likely set forth by people with an unrealistic idea of the weight of their own opinions.\n\n&gt;3) the impact of poetry is greater than that of literature upon the reader.\n\nMore gibberish. I get the whole idea that some people believe poetry to be more powerful in effect than literature, which is fine to think that for yourself. It is another thing entirely to assert that as some sort of cosmic or scientific truth.\n\nThe conciseness of poetry *often* has the effect of giving it a bit more of a punch word-for-word. However, this is neither universal nor unique to poetry.\n\nHere is a famous 6 word novel:\n\nFor sale: baby shoes, never worn.\n\nOr is that poetry? Who can tell?\n\n&gt;while poetry has more relatively meaningful lines, in literature the 'glue' must exist to hold all the elements of the story together.\n\nIn both poetry and literature every sentence matters. It doesn't mean that every single line in the piece has to be a heart-breaking, soul-warming masterpiece, it just has to be meaningful. \",said John\" is fine as long as whatever John said was somehow important. There should be no \"glue\" in any writing ever, each line should fit like pieces of a puzzle.\n\n&gt;the poetry industry\nLol\n\n&gt;Shakespeare was once considered the king of playwrights (citation needed) but now if you took his name off the cover of a modernized version people would complain of how trite his works are.\n\nIf Shakespeares works were modernized then it would be the fault of the editor, not Shakespeare. Well written works that focus on the human condition will always be appreciated, and given that they are understandable (as most of Shakespeare isn't without some translation or knowledge of Victorian England and that vernacular) they will last.\n\n&gt;I don't see the validity in a claim that any entire mode of writing can be superior or inferior to another.\n\nThat's cause there is none. Which is why this statement:\n\n&gt;longer = more expression = better.\n\nis so backwards and why so much of what you wrote is so baffling. You are literally claiming that literature is better and that neither can possibly be better in the same argument. I am so confused.\n\n&gt;Some people make a big point of minimalism, the ability to evoke from an audience with a minimum of material.\n\nIt's not the length, it's how you use it. This goes back to my point that every line in any writing has to matter. Minimalism is just another option, what is important is that it is meaningful &lt;period&gt;.\n\n&gt;where poetry uses tight prose and emphasizes imagery, while novels use narration, to build the intended mental image.\n\nBoth use both. Your perception of both forms is horribly disfigured to the point of not being recognizable.\n\n&gt;nothing about the feelings a reader feels is defined by the amount of words or metaphors it took to create them\n\nThis is true and totally annihilates your own argument that literature is superior. The amount is unimportant. What is important is that the lines that were used were meaningful and enjoyable for the reader.\n\n&gt;By explication all the subtlest themes of poetry can be expanded and alluded to and improved upon. Anything that is said in one sentence will be improved in every qualitative way by expansion.\n\nThis could not be less true. It's like saying beating a dead horse is better the more you beat it. The opposite is more likely to be enjoyable. Once the point is made, move on. Do you really think you could go into a poem by Ezra Pound and make it better? Do you think he could? If I'm getting anything from all of this it is that you do not personally appreciate poetry.\n\n&gt;Nothing is ever expressed better in less words than in more.\n\n\"Fuck you, pay me.\"\n\nHoly shit man, do you even snap?

However, I do have a problem with the idea of 'rape culture', despite its widespread acceptance within the movement. I think that many of its assertions, especially to do with the root causes of behaviour, are based on extremely shaky evidence. I do not think that social attitudes to rape are substantially different from attitudes to other crimes, and I think that proponents of the 'rape culture' idea take an almost entirely one-sided view of social attitudes, and ignore the evidence that rape is, in fact, socially unacceptable to the vast majority of people. I know that this view puts me at odds with a lot of people who I otherwise agree with, so I'll briefly explain the aspects of the 'rape culture' idea that I find problematic and hopefully somebody will be able to change my view.\n\nThe media/pornography\n\nMany proponents of 'rape culture' see the portrayal of rape and sexual violence in the mainstream media or in pornography as dangerous. They argue that viewing these images may make people more likely to rape, or at least make people think that it is more acceptable. But people are perfectly capable of distinguishing fantasy or fiction from reality, and, as far as I am aware, there is little quantitative evidence to back up these claims. Nobody would suggest that 'Oceans 11' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \n\nVictim blaming\n\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of 'victim blaming' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been 'asking for it'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a 'rape culture'.\n\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\n\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that 'rape is rape'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn't know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\n \nSympathy for perpetrators\n\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a 'rape culture'.\n\nRape jokes\n\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting 'rape culture'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that's a nice car - shame they didn't leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \n\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

As a self-identified feminist myself, there's aspects of the concept of rape culture I agree and disagree with. I'll convey what I can that shows that there's at least some merit related to this theory.\n\nMedia portrayal\n\nAlbert Bandura's theory of social learning, supported by repeated studies and tests (although mostly on children, which are arguably more impressionable than adults), demonstrates how behaviors can be learned socially via demonstration, even from watching recordings on a monitor. While I'd agree that it's a stretch to say that an adult's exposure to socially-despised crimes directly *causes* one to commit those crimes, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that repeated exposure to such crimes has a normalizing effect. Depending on your familiarity with certain websites (/r/morbidreality), you may know people who have seen gifs and videos on the internet of people dying, to the point where it somehow doesn't phase them as much. If this is possible, might normalization of sex crimes sound possible? This isn't to say that people for which this is normalized will be more likely to commit sex crimes, but will less likely to respond with sympathy to sex crime victims.\n\nVictim blaming\n\nI'd argue that rape is unique in this regard. While the situations you describe would likely increase one's chances of becoming victim to a crime, those crimes are treated different socially. Crimes of theft and muggings are met with sympathy; when you tell people simply that you have been mugged, they won't automatically assume you did something to provoke them, regardless of whether or not you did (eg. displaying expensive jewelry in a bad neighborhood). The same cannot be said for rape, where generally, there's at least more doubt placed on the victim in absence of details. We do agree that certain factors can affect one's chances of becoming victim to a sex crime, but the way victims are perceived is generally different.\n\nDegrees of Rape\n\nI don't think we disagree here, but I don't think the examples you mention really cover the act of rape itself. Coercion, suggestion, and persuasion are much broader concepts than rape.\n\nSympathy for Perpetrators\n\nAll I can say is, from what I recall, the perpetrators involved in the Steubenville case were not from pitiable backgrounds of poverty or abuse. I could be mistaken, though.\n\nRape jokes\n\nJokes have audiences and contexts - you wouldn't tell the joke about stealing a car to someone who's had their car stolen (unless you really know they're comfortable with it). In the context of people who are not victims of rape, I stand by the normalization argument from above. That aside, the current statistic suggests that 1 in 5 women are victims of rape in their lifetime, far less likely than someone having their car stolen. Increasing statistics are suggesting that, for men, it may actually be similar. That makes it an incredibly risky joke to pull, more so than with jokes about other crimes.\n\nThe recurring argument I'm noticing between these points, though, is that rape is not any different (in regards to its effects on people) than any other crime that gets discussed socially or portrayed in media. That's a bit more difficult to argue against, I suppose, but possibly because I lack evidence suggesting otherwise. Perhaps that's a matter of perspective. I can say, though, that sex crimes do generally have more lasting, personal negative effects than other crimes. Therefore, rape victims can have more difficulty in responding to the above instances than other groups.\n\nI hope you consider this is a reasonable rebuttal."}, {"id": "cm1t49g", "body": "It's a well-put argument - it's a shame you don't have more people responding.

That's a bit more difficult to argue against, I suppose, but possibly because I lack evidence suggesting otherwise. Perhaps that's a matter of perspective.

This may be counter-intuitive, so an explanation follows: If we take a sample group of people who are the same age, we clearly have to divide the yearly incident rate to reflect the proportion of the population our sample represents. Adding up every year over the lifetime of this sample will end up effectively canceling out the preceding division. The rate projected for any given sample will be the same, so the overall rate is the same.\n\nThe far more stunning statistics for rape actually come from (somewhat exaggerated) sexual harassment statistics, which the relevant [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics) article pegs at 1 in 6.\n\n&gt; Victim blaming\n\n&gt; I'd argue that rape is unique in this regard.\n\nIt is, but not for the reason that is typically given. The problem is that most rapes, sexual assaults or serious cases of sexual harassment are carried out by people who already have the confidence of their victim, not by strangers. As such, the typical strategic advice that is thrown about is not helpful and is understandably frustrating to victims of sexual harassment, sexual assault or rape. However, allegations of victim blaming turn a teachable moment into an accusatory context.\n\nRape, sexual assault and sexual harassment are all bad things, and it would be great if we could get rid of them. However, using incorrect numbers or reserving special status for discussions of these crimes only muddies the discussion and makes it difficult to actually reach an actionable consensus for society to implement."}, {"id": "2m7fb5", "body": "I would self-identify as a feminist, and I strongly support the overarching goals of feminism, including the fight against rape in society. However, I do have a problem with the idea of 'rape culture', despite its widespread acceptance within the movement. I think that many of its assertions, especially to do with the root causes of behaviour, are based on extremely shaky evidence. I do not think that social attitudes to rape are substantially different from attitudes to other crimes, and I think that proponents of the 'rape culture' idea take an almost entirely one-sided view of social attitudes, and ignore the evidence that rape is, in fact, socially unacceptable to the vast majority of people. I know that this view puts me at odds with a lot of people who I otherwise agree with, so I'll briefly explain the aspects of the 'rape culture' idea that I find problematic and hopefully somebody will be able to change my view.\n\nThe media/pornography\n\nMany proponents of 'rape culture' see the portrayal of rape and sexual violence in the mainstream media or in pornography as dangerous. They argue that viewing these images may make people more likely to rape, or at least make people think that it is more acceptable. But people are perfectly capable of distinguishing fantasy or fiction from reality, and, as far as I am aware, there is little quantitative evidence to back up these claims. Nobody would suggest that 'Oceans 11' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \n\nVictim blaming\n\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of 'victim blaming' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been 'asking for it'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a 'rape culture'.\n\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\n\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that 'rape is rape'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn't know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\n \nSympathy for perpetrators\n\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a 'rape culture'.\n\nRape jokes\n\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting 'rape culture'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that's a nice car - shame they didn't leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \n\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They are a radical subset, outside I them I don't think anyone believes there is a connection between porn and rape.\n\n&gt; Victim blaming\n\nThere is a fine line between advising someone to take sensible precautions and making them feel as if they are at fault.  The problem is that line is different for different people, so it's been shorted to don't say any precautions.  That then became shortened to any precautions are \"victim blaming\".  Also distance plays a role, I would be likely to advise my friend to not walk down a dark alley after a news story about a mugging; but because so much of what we say is public now, that can be seen as blaming the mugging victim.\n\nAlso the insurance explanation I hear a lot but it isn't exactly the same.  If someone breaks into my unlocked house or takes my phone I drunkenly left at the bar, insurance might not pay my claim but the police would still arrest the thief.  There is no \"rape insurance\" so that link doesn't really work in my opinion.\n\n&gt; notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced\n\nThe problem with the Steubenville case is that the accused were never charged with the crime.  The \"victim\" just named them as rapists and their names and faces were all over the national news.  I would argue that while people do have sympathy for several types of criminals with an environmental factor, that is not something that we as a society extend to rapists.  The sympathy for the accused in Steubenville was a reaction to how we treat anyone accused of rape as a rapist."}, {"id": "2m7fb5", "body": "I would self-identify as a feminist, and I strongly support the overarching goals of feminism, including the fight against rape in society. However, I do have a problem with the idea of 'rape culture', despite its widespread acceptance within the movement. I think that many of its assertions, especially to do with the root causes of behaviour, are based on extremely shaky evidence. I do not think that social attitudes to rape are substantially different from attitudes to other crimes, and I think that proponents of the 'rape culture' idea take an almost entirely one-sided view of social attitudes, and ignore the evidence that rape is, in fact, socially unacceptable to the vast majority of people. I know that this view puts me at odds with a lot of people who I otherwise agree with, so I'll briefly explain the aspects of the 'rape culture' idea that I find problematic and hopefully somebody will be able to change my view.\n\nThe media/pornography\n\nMany proponents of 'rape culture' see the portrayal of rape and sexual violence in the mainstream media or in pornography as dangerous. They argue that viewing these images may make people more likely to rape, or at least make people think that it is more acceptable. But people are perfectly capable of distinguishing fantasy or fiction from reality, and, as far as I am aware, there is little quantitative evidence to back up these claims. Nobody would suggest that 'Oceans 11' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \n\nVictim blaming\n\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of 'victim blaming' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been 'asking for it'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a 'rape culture'.\n\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\n\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that 'rape is rape'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn't know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\n \nSympathy for perpetrators\n\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a 'rape culture'.\n\nRape jokes\n\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting 'rape culture'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that's a nice car - shame they didn't leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \n\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This issue is that, in rape, the more we 'blame' the victim, the less we 'blame' the criminal. Like if she was drunk and in an alleyway this guy had no choice but to have sex with her.

They argue that viewing these images may make people more likely to rape, or at least make people think that it is more acceptable. But people are perfectly capable of distinguishing fantasy or fiction from reality, and, as far as I am aware, there is little quantitative evidence to back up these claims. Nobody would suggest that 'Oceans 11' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \n\nVictim blaming\n\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of 'victim blaming' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been 'asking for it'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a 'rape culture'.\n\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\n\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that 'rape is rape'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn't know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\n \nSympathy for perpetrators\n\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a 'rape culture'.\n\nRape jokes\n\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting 'rape culture'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that's a nice car - shame they didn't leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \n\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Communication during intercourse is seen as \"unattractive\" for many.\n\nThis can and will lead to rape because it prevents you from knowing the other person.  Sex is an intimate and communicative activity.\n\nRape culture exists in the way we treat sex as a disgusting and callous thing.\n\nRape culture exists in the way we value virginity and the shame we attach to sex.\n\nSo much shame that we often have to be drunk past the point of responsible consent to hookup.\n\nRape exists in the back of young men and women's minds when we think things like, \"all women have rape fantasies,\" \"rape is natural,\" \"x is not *really* rape,\" \"it doesn't matter how the other person feels, it just matters how *I* feel I've conducted myself.\"\n\nNow on to your examples (bear in mind that this is how *I* view rape culture theory, this is why it is a theory, it is open to interpretation):\n\n&gt;media/pornography\n\nI think these things are only symptoms and not a root cause.  I agree that people should be able to fantasize about whatever they want, and they should not feel ashamed for it.  \n\nHonestly what I find more \"rapey\" than porn or video games or hentai that depicts a fictional rape scene, is pornography where women are obviously faking their enjoyment.  \n\nSeeing depictions of \"fake enjoyment\" conditions us to ignore our partner's *actual* signals.\n\n&gt;Degrees of rape/grey areas\n\nI honestly agree wholeheartedly.  I think there *should* be degrees of rape, however this does not negate the fact that rape is still rape.  However, what frustrates me more is the idea that this is what the discussion is about.  I am not saying that someone who date rapes someone who was drunk because they were reckless and did not care to obtain proper consent should be punished equally to someone who violently rapes another person, I just think both of these crimes need to be recognized as *some* degree of rape.\n\n&gt;Sympathy for perpetrators\n\nI think the problem here is not that some people express sympathy for the perpetrators, it is that this is such a divisive issue.  On one side you have people who continually assume innocence and on the other you have people who assume guilt.  I agree that we should be able to be more mature when discussing rape.  Innocent until proven guilty still needs to be an important part of the process, and it'd be great if the media could stop turning these cases into a circus.\n\n&gt;rape jokes\n\nSame with this, I think we need to be about to be mature about this.  For me maturity is the acceptance of the idea that anything *can* be joked about, of course that doesn't mean that it isn't a delicate issue and that certain jokes about rape *are* truly offensive and should be decried.  \n\nPersonally I despise Daniel Tosh beyond his rape joke controversy, I generally just find him to be mean and arrogant and not that funny.   But Louie C.K. or Sarah Silverman have made jokes about rape that I thought were both poignant and hilarious.\n\nComedy is a powerful critical medium, we need to be open to discuss anything, but that doesn't mean we have to like what everyone is saying.\n\n"}, {"id": "2m7fb5", "body": "I would self-identify as a feminist, and I strongly support the overarching goals of feminism, including the fight against rape in society.

I think the notion that's trying to be changed with this is that only violent rape is rape, and any of what is generally considered a grey area is just bad decisions or regret.  \n\nI suppose the points that follow rest a bit on the above.  Rape is more than just violent rape.  Say, for the sake of argument, sex without enhtusiastic consent (whatever that may mean) is some form of rape.  I realize not defining consent can be seen a bit as goal post moving, but the reality is, maybe it's not defined all the way, and I'm not going to claim I know how every scenario should be labeled.  \n\nThe Media/Pornography:  I think an aspect of rape culture is not with the assumption that porn makes people rape, or violent movies make people violent.  I think the problem really is that media can influence what people see as normal or acceptable behavior that shouldn't be.  For example, in movies/tv how often do you see the following types of scenarios:  \n\n- a guy and girl start making out or getting intimate, then stop and talk about how far they want it to go and agreeing to it ahead of time.  \n\n- a guy and girl are arguing, in the heat of the argument, the guy kisses the girl.  She slaps him... he kisses her again, she slaps him more lightly, and starts getting into it and they have sex.  \n\nI'm sure there are at least a few scenes/movies where the latter comes to mind, but I don't know any for the former, and I think that's more the point.  So I think regardless of whether media is influencing life or vice versa, the type of scenarios that play out as normal in media either cause problems in how men/women interact when it comes to sex, or makes evident that things are viewed as normal or ok when they're not.  \n\n\nVictim Blaming:  A couple thoughts on this.  First, someone that wears a nice watch in a bad neighborhood is not responsible for getting mugged.  It's phrased differently in the op, and I think that might be a bit telling, because it seems nearly every time this is brought up, it's comparing someone wearing loads of jewelry, or leaving a really nice car unlocked, or wearing expensive clothes in a bad neighborhood.  In other words, the comparison is basically using a scenario in which someone is basically 'asking for it'.  So a couple thoughts, and I'll say these are more rhetorical because I'm not going to look up the statistics (I'm confident I'd be proven right if I did).  Of all people that were mugged, how often are the wearing lots of jewelry or in some way advertising that they have something to take?  How many stolen cars are the result of someone leaving the doors unlocked?  \n\nvictim blaming can also have an unintended side effect of misrepresenting what can actually put you in danger.  \"If you don't want to get mugged, don't wear flashy jewelry\" will probably not stop the majority of people getting mugged.  Only let people you trust see your jewelry doesn't stop a friend or family member that you thought you could trust from stealing it.  So things typically considered victim blaming have two problems, they don't represent a significant portion of the actual threat, so it's not the best advice, and as a side effect, it has the potential to give people a false sense of security in a situation that can actually be dangerous.

Nobody would suggest that 'Oceans 11' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \n\nVictim blaming\n\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of 'victim blaming' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been 'asking for it'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a 'rape culture'.\n\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\n\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that 'rape is rape'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn't know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\n \nSympathy for perpetrators\n\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a 'rape culture'.\n\nRape jokes\n\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting 'rape culture'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that's a nice car - shame they didn't leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \n\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That victims may share some responsibility in some cases might make sense (civil maybe). However, some cases an act, like this form of attack is a Novus actus interveniens - that is that it is a new intervening act that breaks the chain of causation (Duff - Responsibility, Restoration and Retribution). \n\nNovus actus interveniens: \"Even if the defendant can be shown to have acted negligently, there will be no liability if some new intervening act breaks the chain of causation between that negligence and the loss or damage sustained by the claimant. In order to break the causal chain, the novus actus interveniens must supercede the original conduct and become the proximate cause of the eventual result.\" http://en.jurispedia.org/index.php/Criminal_law_(Scotland)#Novus_Actus_Interveniens\n\nMaybe privately you want to hold someone responsible for making poor choices that were this or that. But the victim of rape is not answerable to you for that because they have not committed a public wrong, they are not responsible or do they have to make an answer. There is no negotiation of their responsibility in this matter. \nIn criminal law, it is argued by Duff that it does not make sense to negotiate the criminals responsibility against the victims with certain crimes. Further some crimes are the sort from which we should be categorically safe and that are categorically wrong (not the sort which can be negotiated, how much responsibility each party had).\n\nEdited to add - further a culture that misplaces responsibility on the victim can lead to victims not coming forward with their assault for fear of (wildly misguided) judgement, which means rapists are not held accountable.

"}, {"id": "cm2s95p", "body": "&gt; With no other crime will you hear these kinds of remarks said about the victim.\n\nI disagree. Imagine somebody walked into a Hells Angels bar, got drunk, started insulting people, and got beaten up. I'm sure that there would be people who would say that they deserved what they got. I, for the record, would disagree. \n\nHow about if a burglar was shot while breaking into a house? There would be those who would argue that they deserved it because of the situation they had put themselves in, despite the fact that the punishment agreed on by society for burglary is a relatively short period of imprisonment and *not* death by shotgun. Again, I would personally disagree, but you can't deny that these attitudes exist with regard to other crimes. \n\nI'm not going to defend the comments that you quote, most of them make my skin crawl. But twitter trolls will say these kinds of things about anything. Nate Hubbard was the coach of the football team, and obviously biased because of it. His view is hardly representative of a whole culture. Serena Williams is just one individual, whose view I disagree with. \n\nRegarding Poppy Harlow:\n\n&gt; \"It was incredibly emotional, incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures \u2014 star football players, very good students \u2014 literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart\"\n\nI saw the trial footage, and it *was* emotional. The boys were obviously distraught and repentant, and it is always difficult to watch another human being in pain, no matter what they have done. Especially, because we recognise that many people do stupid things when they are young that they later live to regret. This does *not* mean that their behaviour was in any way acceptable. It does *not* mean that they didn't deserve to be punished, and it does *not* mean that rape in general is ever okay. That is not what Poppy Harlow said (at least as far as I can see from this quote). All she did was express sympathy for the suffering of fellow humans. Perhaps it was insensitive to do so publicly in light of the suffering that they had inflicted on others, but it is surely a natural human response. I don't think that expressing sympathy for the obvious suffering of other human beings deserves accusations of being complicit in a 'rape culture'. In fact I find such accusations deeply insulting. Even in cases of school shootings, there are those who would point out that it is not just a tragedy for the innocent victims, but a tragedy that someone so young with their life ahead of them would be led by whatever it was that caused their behaviour to do something so terrible. Such people are not complicit in a 'murder culture'.\n\nI'm sure there are other examples you could cite, and I know that extremely unsavoury attitudes to rape do exist among a small minority of individuals within our society. I just don't think this justifies the use of the term 'rape culture'. I'm not denying that these kinds of things are said. My problem is with the *concept* of 'rape culture' as you can see from the statement of my view. \n\n&gt; The Steubenville rape case is a perfect example of rape culture.\n\nYou say that this is an *example* of rape culture, but what you really mean is, that you are going to *label* this 'rape culture'. What I'm saying is, that I think it is a bad label. It's an extremely provocative and loaded term. Incidentally, the fact that some feminists use the term shows that they understand precisely that the majority of people in our culture find rape abhorrent rather than acceptable. If they didn't, the term would not have the power that it does. \n\nThe *way* in which the term is used is also problematic. It's a charge which some feminists level at anything in society (for example porn or rape jokes) which they dislike, without pausing to think whether there is any evidence that what they are saying bears any relation to reality. The term 'rape apologist', again highly insulting, is applied indiscriminately by some feminists to those who disagree with their particular views. I don't want to be too antagonistic or confrontational here, but I do think that you are slightly guilty of this kind of thinking yourself at the end of your post when you say:\n\n&gt; That in itself is rape culture: ignorance of what rape actually is, and/or acceptance of sexual assault.\n\nSo all views which disagree with *your* idea of 'what rape actually is' are by definition 'ignorant' and part of a 'rape culture'? You and I probably agree about what constitutes rape, but I am willing to accept that there are other views out there and that many (although not all) of the people holding those views are thoughtful and compassionate people who do not deserve such an insulting label. \n\nAs for acceptance of sexual assault, I disagree that this is widespread in society. Even the abhorrent twitter quotes you have posted are not *accepting* that a sexual assault took place, they are *denying* it. Acceptance would be, 'who cares that she got raped, it doesn't matter because rape isn't that bad'. Denial and acceptance are different things entirely. There are people out there who deny that 9/11 was a terrorist attack, but that doesn't mean they accept the doctrines of Al Qaeda. \n"}, {"id": "cm2h9p4", "body": "The Steubenville rape case is a perfect example of rape culture.

However, I do have a problem with the idea of 'rape culture', despite its widespread acceptance within the movement. I think that many of its assertions, especially to do with the root causes of behaviour, are based on extremely shaky evidence. I do not think that social attitudes to rape are substantially different from attitudes to other crimes, and I think that proponents of the 'rape culture' idea take an almost entirely one-sided view of social attitudes, and ignore the evidence that rape is, in fact, socially unacceptable to the vast majority of people. I know that this view puts me at odds with a lot of people who I otherwise agree with, so I'll briefly explain the aspects of the 'rape culture' idea that I find problematic and hopefully somebody will be able to change my view.\n\nThe media/pornography\n\nMany proponents of 'rape culture' see the portrayal of rape and sexual violence in the mainstream media or in pornography as dangerous. They argue that viewing these images may make people more likely to rape, or at least make people think that it is more acceptable. But people are perfectly capable of distinguishing fantasy or fiction from reality, and, as far as I am aware, there is little quantitative evidence to back up these claims. Nobody would suggest that 'Oceans 11' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \n\nVictim blaming\n\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of 'victim blaming' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been 'asking for it'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a 'rape culture'.\n\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\n\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that 'rape is rape'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn't know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\n \nSympathy for perpetrators\n\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a 'rape culture'.\n\nRape jokes\n\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting 'rape culture'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that's a nice car - shame they didn't leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \n\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "cm2puro", "body": "Regarding pregnancy, I live in the UK where few people will bat an eyelid if you have an abortion. I can appreciate that this must be a particularly traumatic problem in places where attitudes are different.\n\nI don't think rape is handled substantially differently from other violent crimes involving more than one person. Imagine if a man went to the police and said he had been beaten up in a bar. The police would indeed ask if he had said or done anything to provoke the attack, and might be skeptical if he said that you had simply been minding your own business when someone beat him up for the fun of it, even though we know that there are people out there in society who enjoy violence for its own sake. People generally assume that violent behaviour must be caused or provoked in some way. This is particularly evident in the intense speculation aroused by events such as school shootings which have no obvious cause. I think that what people call 'victim blaming' is a symptom of a general lack of understanding about the real causes of rape (a problem incidentally shared by many proponents of the 'rape culture' idea). I'm not saying it doesn't exist, or that it isn't a problem, just that it is not evidence of a 'rape culture'. \n\nIf a case like the one I just outlined went to court, it would be expected that the defence lawyer would cross examine the accuser. They might attempt to demonstrate that the victim had a history of violent behaviour, not to show that he was 'asking for it', but to show that he was lying when he said he didn't throw the first punch. They would try to show that what happened was not an unprovoked assault but a normal bar fight. Unfortunately, in the case of rape, it is not a history of violent conduct but a history of promiscuity and dishonesty that the lawyer will try to demonstrate. I understand that this must be particularly traumatic for victims, and I think, in recognition of this, that there may even be a case for treating rape as an exception so that such aggressive cross-examination is not allowed. However, cross examination on matters relating to the character of the witness that are relevant to the offence is not evidence of 'rape culture'. \n\n&gt; And don't you know women aren't supposed to go out after dark alone. They're asking for something bad.\n\nI've had exactly this kind of attitude from police when reporting theft. \"You really shouldn't leave your car in this area of town. You know it's a high-crime area\" etc. etc. It's annoying, but it exists elsewhere.\n\nI know that there are a small number of people out there who do hold extremely unsavoury views on rape. There are also huge problems with the way in which rape is understood and handled within our society, and I'm determined that we should fight to improve things. Some of these problems are unique to rape, for example low conviction rates, but that is to do with the nature of the crime, and *every* kind of crime has specific problems associated with it. I don't think that these problems add up to a 'rape culture'. If you want to call our society a 'rape culture' then, by the exact same criteria, you also have to call it a 'violence culture', a 'theft culture', a 'racism culture', a 'fraud culture', in fact, so many types of culture that the term evaporates into meaninglessness. \n\nExcept it isn't a meaningless term. It's a highly loaded and aggressive term which seeks to hold large sectors of society to account for the actions of a few individuals. It's also a charge which some feminists level indiscriminately at anything in society (for example porn or rape jokes) which they dislike, without pausing to think whether there is any evidence that what they are saying bears any relation to reality. This is why I think it's time the term was abandoned, so that we can focus on really and seriously dealing with the problem of rape, the causes of which are not only cultural.\n"}, {"id": "2m7fb5", "body": "I would self-identify as a feminist, and I strongly support the overarching goals of feminism, including the fight against rape in society. However, I do have a problem with the idea of 'rape culture', despite its widespread acceptance within the movement. I think that many of its assertions, especially to do with the root causes of behaviour, are based on extremely shaky evidence. I do not think that social attitudes to rape are substantially different from attitudes to other crimes, and I think that proponents of the 'rape culture' idea take an almost entirely one-sided view of social attitudes, and ignore the evidence that rape is, in fact, socially unacceptable to the vast majority of people. I know that this view puts me at odds with a lot of people who I otherwise agree with, so I'll briefly explain the aspects of the 'rape culture' idea that I find problematic and hopefully somebody will be able to change my view.\n\nThe media/pornography\n\nMany proponents of 'rape culture' see the portrayal of rape and sexual violence in the mainstream media or in pornography as dangerous. They argue that viewing these images may make people more likely to rape, or at least make people think that it is more acceptable. But people are perfectly capable of distinguishing fantasy or fiction from reality, and, as far as I am aware, there is little quantitative evidence to back up these claims. Nobody would suggest that 'Oceans 11' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \n\nVictim blaming\n\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of 'victim blaming' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been 'asking for it'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a 'rape culture'.\n\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\n\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that 'rape is rape'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn't know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\n \nSympathy for perpetrators\n\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a 'rape culture'.\n\nRape jokes\n\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting 'rape culture'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that's a nice car - shame they didn't leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \n\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Over time, a consumer's choices will become fewer and fewer until the market is dominated by a handful of players who can then easily coordinate their prices/services to maximize profit with minimal innovation.

Let me just quote a [paper](http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2014/7/regulation-v37n2-8.pdf) by Christopher Yoo of the University of Pennsylvania:\n&gt;The most recent data collected by the FCC indicate that as of December 2012, 99 percent of US households live in census blocks with access to two or more fixed line or mobile wireless broadband providers capable of providing the benchmark speeds of 3 Mpbs down stream and 768 kpbs upstream. Some 97 percent have access to three or more providers. Faster service tiers are also becoming more competitive. For example, 96 percent of US households have access to two or more providers offering service at the higher standard of 6 Mpbs downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream, and 81 percent have access to three or more. Even at the highest tear reported (10Mpbs downstream and 1.5 Mpbs upstream), 80 percent have access to two or more providers and 48 percent have access to three or more.\n\nIf you're going to describe the lack of competition in a market, monopoly simiply is not the word to describe it, it is an oligopoly. The reason that internet provision is costly is primarily due to high natural barriers to entry (you have to invest in a lot of capital to deliver wireless service, so their are high fixed costs upon start up) and huge economies of scale.\n\nYou could argue that this market structure is not competitive enough, however that's ultimately an empirical question and doesn't immediately imply that regulation is necessary. Again, quoting Yoo:\n&gt;Although these markets are not perfectly competitive, empirical studies indicate that markets with three firms are workably competitive, with most of the competitive benefit occurring with the entry of the second or third firm and minimal benefits resulting from entry into markets that already have three to five firms. One must also bear in mind that regulation is costly and typically falls short of replicating the performance of a perfectly competitive market. Regulation thus turns on a comparison of second-best outcomes. Although the poor performance of unregulated monopoly justifies the significant cost of regulation, an unregulated oligopoly performs sufficiently better at some point tips the balance in favor of deregulation.\n"}, {"id": "cm1lp4c", "body": "We do not have \"free market\" competition between service providers.

But without the cable companies propping them up, there is ultimately no Netflix and no TV industry. \n\nWhat people want is to get essentially all the content they have now from cable TV but on demand for only $10 per month. That just isn't sustainable. \n\nAssuming they were allowed to do so, due to very complex technical reasons, the cable companies are in a position to provide a much higher-quality streaming service at lower costs than Netflix, YouTube, etc. and Netflix is keenly aware of this.\n\nThat's what \"net neutrality\" is all about. It's about keeping Comcast from making a better streaming service than Netflix. \n\n"}, {"id": "cm1s9jh", "body": "&gt;The legislation needed is literally one sentence long. \"Internet providers are not allowed to throttle bandwidth based on source of request\"\n\nI might actually support that legislation, but that's not what Title II is.

The bureaucrats would then consider whether the prices are fair. FCC bureaucrats would also hold sway over plans to expand or build digital networks. Under such conditions, who would invest to build the next generation of broadband technologies?\"\n\n&gt;Find me a small innovator that's capable of laying a multimillion dollar broadband network in a space where there's already an incumbent provider. \n\nVenture-funded startups are capable of some amazing feats of engineering, but Title II introduces further regulatory hurdles to doing so.\n\nEdit: I've decided to award you a \u2206, since the more I think about it I agree with your hypothetical single-sentence legislation.

Local or Federal?\n\nIt is local governments which are allowing monopolies.  Either way, the federal government needs to step in and set the rules.\n\nIt is interesting to me that you find laws and rules like the Sherman Antitrust Act to be fine, but others which state the internet should be open and essentially a pay for whatever you can use (utility) and don't discriminate to be bad.\n\nI'd suggest you define what end result you want and then work backwards to find what is needed to make it happen.\n\nI want internet as a utility.  I want dumb pipes which I pay for in size (10,100,1000mbps) and I can use all I want at fair market price.  Today, lets make up a number, a gig costs .01 cents to deliver.  Electric, etc, it costs money to push bits.  Add on a use-fee for future expansion and maintenance.  If I download a terrabyte, charge me $10 plus another flat $15 for expansion/maintenance.  All the while, hey ISPs, you don't get to decide what is and is not allowed and at what speeds.  I'm paying.  You stop caring.\n\nThat is where I want to see internet going.\n\nHow do we get there?\n\n1) Local governments need to be banned from granting monopolies to ISPs.  It's anti-consumer any way you slice it.\n\n2) ISPs need to start sharing their lines.  I'm not saying they need to give them away.  But they need to rent them at fair prices.  Why?  We can't have bundles of 200 lines going to every house.  Shared last mile.  We use it well for telephone.\n\n3) ISPs need to stop fucking with the bits that are flowing.  I don't care if you don't like that I'm visiting website X or using service Y.  I don't care if service Z is sinking your company.  You don't get to decide on ways to make it inconvenient or impossible to use.  I want bits, you give bits.  End of story.\n\nIs this happening today?  No.  Why?  We've handed the keys to the internet to the large content creators who are doing nothing but trying to become larger.  We're letting them run the internet in the same \"hands off\" way we let the banks run.  That's to say we let them do what they want to make a buck and we don't ask questions.\n\nThat is a problem.\n\nRegulation isn't bad.  It's not a boogeyman.  When someone does something _not_ in the public interest, we _need_ the goverment to regulate.  The companies are _proving_ they can't be trusted to do the right thing.  It's time to step in and tell them how to do it.  Just like we did with the telco's.\n\nDo you agree with how the telcos were handled?  I'm talking about sharing the lines.  Forcing competition.  And breaking up those that held everyone hostage to milk as much money as possible?\n\nWhat is being suggested is similar.  Smaller scale as net neutrality isn't about breaking up the big players.  It's not about sharing last mile.  It's not about stopping local monopolies.  It's merely about stopping providers from discriminating against what you request.\n\nI'm all for them going much farther but this is a necessary step to go in the direction I want the internet to go.\n\nWhere do you want it to go?  How do you forsee it getting there?  You don't want net-neutrality imposed by the government.  You don't want the government to intervene.

For the foreseeable future most of the US population will only have a single ISP to choose from for high speed internet.\n\nYour next point is essentially a non-sequitur.  CISPA, PIPA, and SOPA are all failed bills.  There seems to be a sizable contingent in congress interested in those types of bills, but none of them are really affected by net neutrality one way or another.  In a world where Title II regulation has passed, the government has the exact same ability to enforce a law such as SOPA as they would in a world where that isn't the case.  Similarly, NSA surveillance is unlikely to be affected by Title II classification.  The NSA, using whatever legal or illegal means, collecting whatever data they already do, would not be materially affected by net neutrality one way or another.  They would have no greater or worse ability to intercept data under Title II as they do now.\n\nEssentially the specter of 'government regulation' isn't a blank check for the government to suddenly do bad things to the internet, it's important to look at what is actually affected by that regulation.  This doesn't make it any more or less likely the government will do something to the internet, all it does is limit the ability for other proven bad actors (ISPs) to adversely affect the internet for their customers."}, {"id": "2m79tl", "body": "To be clear, I am not opposed to net neutrality as in freedom and openness on the internet, but rather to [Net Neutrality the regulatory regime being pushed by Obama right now](http://i.imgur.com/qOf4NpQ.png).

Due to the nature of the product, the more customers an ISP has, it becomes vastly cheaper to provide service per customer. So it is very easy for companies to start cheap and get a lot of customers, drive other companies out of business until they are the only company left (or one of two or three) creating a monopoly or duopoly. Then they raise prices far higher than is necessary just because they can, you have no other choice but pay or have no internet.\n\nThis leaves the government with two options. Step in and regulate (Title II, like when they broke up Bell phone back in the day) or try and warn the ISPs and push them back until innovation takes over and pushes the monopoly back (what they did, successfully, when Microsoft was nearly a monopoly). The problem is that they tried the second option when the FCC looked at cable broadband and declared that it did not fall under Title II. They did this to try and let the free market handle the situation.

I accept that the free market is best for allocating resources, but the free market doesn't mean no rules at all.  For example, we have rules against collusion, monopoly, and anti-competitive business practices intended to replace \"winning\" in the marketplace with winning by actively harming consumers or competitors.\n\nFor me, this is where NN fits in.  NN is just the internet equivalent of saying that anti-competitive business practices should be illegal.  I would argue that not adhering to NN is itself already illegal under antitrust legislation, but it's an intellectual argument that requires judges to make proper rulings based on interpreting broad antitrust law into technological usage, which they have proven to suck at, badly.  Time Warner Cable cutting a deal with Facebook which allows them better, faster access at the expense of other social networks is an abuse of TWC's position as a gatekeeper in the market.\n\nAn ISP which does not provide net neutrality, in my view, is guilty of violations against the marketplace.  Codifying NN as the law of the land is a clarification of the spirit of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  ISP's have disproportionate market power in that they are literally the pathways to interaction with the rest of the country (and world).  Any actions which degrade the experience of end-users by favoring some websites over others is an abuse of market position, a form of collusion, and a violation of basic free market principles.\n\nNet neutrality is already the law of the land on the principle that anti-competitive business activity is illegal (Sherman Act), but to avoid confusion, it should be codified as law."}, {"id": "2m79tl", "body": "To be clear, I am not opposed to net neutrality as in freedom and openness on the internet, but rather to [Net Neutrality the regulatory regime being pushed by Obama right now](http://i.imgur.com/qOf4NpQ.png).

While I think some of your points are good, I am not sure that the market pressure will significantly change because of Google Fiber. While it has made some differences, the monopolies are already doubling down with legislation and various means to reduce the spread of GF. Various towns that have set up their own fiber systems have been lawyered out of providing service. While I think we all *hope* that GF will help to provide a competitive landscape, I am not so hopeful. (I still hope, just not blindly.) \n\nAs to the point about the government spying on us, this point does not impress me. They already do. Corporations, agencies, and probably just random people spy on each other. I will grant that it may make it a touch easier for them to hide things from us then since the government will have a little more leverage, but they already are doing that. It is not something that we have to worry about possibly happening. It already has. The government being in charge of regulation will just make it like the phones of old. If you were scared of every phone call being recorded, well, same thing now. Or vice verse. \n\nWhile I can understand the libertarian point of view that companies should charge whatever they can get away with, it is not conducive to ~~discrimination~~ dissemination of information or innovation. For instance, the US government originally funded newspapers. This was because information empowered the people to have an opinion. (You can argue propaganda etc. But without information, you can't have any informed opinion.) As technology becomes the backbone of our communication and centered around the internet, it then becomes imperative for everyone to be able to access it. This will not happen when rates are set to be as high as possible. Secondly, innovation suffers since many internet companies have gotten their starts due to the neutrality of data treatment. It would be like a really high tax on business in a city. Only big businesses could afford to make new locations.

The Netflix encrypted streaming model violates Internet standards and wastes lots of bandwidth, costs the ISPs have to soak up. The dispute here is that the ISPs want Netflix, etc. to soak up some of those costs. \n"}, {"id": "2m79tl", "body": "To be clear, I am not opposed to net neutrality as in freedom and openness on the internet, but rather to [Net Neutrality the regulatory regime being pushed by Obama right now](http://i.imgur.com/qOf4NpQ.png).

Title II is a far-reaching regulatory leviathan that has [been growing in complexity since the 1930s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Act_of_1934) and would give the US government far-reaching powers in dictating how the internet is used - see http://online.wsj.com/articles/obama-vs-the-internet-1415667174 (paywall, [search google and click the first result](http://www.google.com/search?q=obama%20vs.%20the%20internet%20-%20wall%20street%20journal)).\n\nWith innovations like Google Fiber, [municipal broadband](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/opinion/the-wire-next-time.html), and [internet microsatellites](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/10/spacex-will-announce-micro-satellites-for-low-cost-internet-within-three-months/) *, it is obvious that internet-providing innovations are being developed at an accelerating pace, and in a few years the mere thought of throttling customers' access to certain websites would be suicide to traditional ISPs (hooray free market!). The only thing that could kill the emergence of smaller incoming ISP competitors is an overbearing regulatory regime that costs a fortune to comply with.\n\nIn the past few years with CISPA, PIPA, SOPA, and NSA surveillance, it has become abundantly clear that the US government abhors freedom and openness on the internet. Do you really think our leaders have suddenly changed their minds are acting virtuously? Of course not. They're looking for the upper hand to control how the internet is used, and if you don't think they will attempt to use net neutrality measures as a backdoor for homeland security and copyright enforcement then you haven't been paying attention. I believe that the net neutrality issue will go away on its own, but that if we screw this up by giving the government regulatory powers we could destroy what makes the internet so great, permanently.\n\nPlease somebody change my view because I seem to be the only tech-savvy person on the internet who feels this way. I even find myself disagreeing with the EFF on this one.\n\nEdit: *One more innovation idea: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/pirate-bay-plans-to-build-aerial-server-drones-with-35-linux-computer/. The point is these things are popping up almost everyday, and there is a huge pot of cash waiting for companies that can find new innovative ways to provide internet access. Like the out-of-control tax code, complex regulatory schemes favor the big players and prevent little guys from trying these new ideas.\n\n**Edit2: /u/pikk has [successfully changed my view](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2m79tl/cmv_i_am_opposed_to_governmentenforced_net/cm1s9jh), with a caveat: I would support a single-line piece of legislation that prohibits content/source-discrimination with surgical precision, but I still oppose the ham-handed Title II designation for reasons I've listed as well as those enumerated in the WaPo article I mentioned above, which I strongly recommend reading.**\n\nEdit3: Just realized I've been saying WaPo when I meant Wall Street Journal. *s/WaPo/Wall Street Journal/g*.
