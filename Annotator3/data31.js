This assumption indicates an obvious lack of understanding about mental illness and how it evolves. Mental illnesses (this includes eating disorders) are influenced by countless variables other than societal pressure. I don't know if you thought this example was funny or clever or adequate as evidence to substantiate your point - because it was none of those things. This is akin to claiming that depressed people have a hard time getting out of bed because they're lazy, and that the solution to this is to tell them to just suck it up and stop whining. \n\nThis list only includes a few factors that contribute to the development of eating disorders, for reference - there are many, many more based on very specific circumstances and environments:\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/factors-may-contribute-eating-disorders\n\nSecondly, you claimed that they made it very clear that, essentially, girls are too weak to handle ridiculously unrealistic dolls. This is an enormous leap from what I read in the article. If you truly believe this, show me how you think the article made a \"very clear statement.\" Otherwise, you're doing some serious mental gymnastics here and making a completely unfounded claim \u2013 seemingly hearing what you only *want* to hear. What I gleaned from the article was this, mostly:\n\n&gt;\u201cI wanted to show that reality is cool,\u201d Lamm says. \u201cAnd a lot of toys make kids go into fantasy, but why don\u2019t they show real life is cool? It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s really all we have. And that\u2019s awesome.\" \n\nNote the use of the word \"kids\" instead of \"girls.\" This includes *all* children and doesn't imply that kids are too weak to handle disfigured dolls. It only implies that the way the doll looks is not an accurate reflection of reality, and kids deserve to be able to experience and explore reality as well as fantasy - even through playtime. What's being advocated for here is that discovering reality as a sort of novel phenomenon through play at a young age is a healthy way to allow children to acclimate to the way things actually are, rather than become conditioned to think there is a certain way things *should* be (this includes the unattainable figure of the classic Barbie).\n\n&gt;What they do and don't approve of doesn't really matter.\n\n&gt;What they do and don't do matter.\n\nReally? Well, what are you doing to advocate for men's rights since you've stated that you believe that women have it easier? What is your plan to fix the issue? What are you doing now to help the cause since you seem to have such a firm stance? If you are doing nothing, then in this same vein of logic, what you do and don't approve of doesn't matter either, and this entire debate is void of meaning. \n\nFinally, I'm not quite sure why this change has caused you to lose some respect for adult women. I'm an adult woman. Does that mean you should respect me less simply because of a decision with which I had nothing to do? Your logic is fundamentally flawed by assuming that this all revolves around men vs. women and who has it harder. Perhaps redefining your view of what the entire argument is even about would help you to understand a different perspective. \n\nYou've mentioned several times that you think girls should suck it up instead of being babied. You forget to acknowledge that this whole \"suck it up\" mentality is one that actually propagates completely unrealistic standards for men in the first place. You forget that there are fathers who humiliate their sons by isolating them in the front yard and tying signs around their necks indicating that they're punished because they couldn't catch a baseball. You forget that the reason that there's an assumption that men cannot be victims of physical abuse by women is because of these standards and because of the suck it up mentality. \n\nSo is everyone supposed to suck it up all the time? When the court takes away the custody of a loving father's children simply because men are deemed less suitable to care for their children even if they are better parents, what then? Well, he can suck it up, right? I mean that's what men do, so what's the issue? \n\nIn my opinion, the point of feminism is to eradicate these useless gender roles that are so deeply imbedded in our society that you can't even see the hypocrisy in your own opinions.

Because that would be equal and show equal concern for both genders and body image/realism? Or do you think that harshly treating people in general makes for stronger people? And/or things like harsher prison sentences make men better/stronger? Or maybe that harder treatment on men separates the weak from the strong? Like perhaps some men come away with body image and self esteem issues, but that minority is a fair sacrifice for everyone else that concludes that stuff just doesn't matter and is thus stronger? And all women suffer from the coddling to the 'weak' ones and would thus be better off if the weak ones were ignored and everyone else could come out stronger?\n\n*(not sure if any of that came across mocking, I don't mean it to be.

The way that women and men are valued differently is not strictly sociological... There are strong instinctive components to this.

Women,  on the other hand,  are valued by men primarily based on perceived genetic fitness and fertility (age,  symmetry, proportion, lack of visible signs of disease). \n\nThis dichotomy can be seen expressed in other species as well,  in different ways. With birds,  for example,  the females tend to select by perceived genetic fitness (appearance) and the ability to perform elaborate rituals,  Implying health and surplus resource collection ability.  The males tend to have less visible criteria,  but tend toward symmetry and availability,  as their mating investment may be much lower. \n\nAt the end of the day,  though we have conscious agency,  our base tendencies are going to stronly reflect our genetic heritage as mammals with a protracted infancy and a very dangerous birth process.

Chinese corporations treat employees like cogs to be replaced once the old one is burned out--they don't invest in their workers or in an atmosphere of creativity. IP protection is a joke, also discouraging innovation. Strong favoritism for the bureaucratically run SOEs make it difficult for competition to occur.

It's not a strong basis for a relationship. Countries work with China, in Africa, for example, but even those countries are angry that the Chinese import their own workers instead of using the locals.

This means that after every bounce, there will be another bounce. So in some sense, the bounces never stop. They just become lower and faster. Yet in real time, [it can be proven](http://www.museful.net/2012/system-modelling/zeno-bouncing) that the bouncing ceases entirely after a finite number of seconds. Now suppose someone is initially hitting the ball like in basketball, bouncing it once every second by adding energy to it after every bounce. Suppose each bounce represents one subjectively felt second, and each real second in time represents, well, a real second in time. Now the person stops bouncing the ball, and it starts bouncing faster and lower, faster and lower. Physically, that ball (if it is a rigid/hard body) will bounce an infinite number of times in a finite number of seconds. If each bounce was a subjectively felt second, then there was a subjective eternity in a few seconds of dying bounces.

The warm blood circulated from the artery into the cylinders of the bypass machine, where it was cooled down before being returned to her body. Her body temperature began to fall, and at 11:05 a.m. Pam\u2019s heart stopped. **Her EEG brain waves flattened into total silence. A few minutes later, her brain stem became totally unresponsive**, and her body temperature fell to a sepulchral 60 degrees Fahrenheit. At 11:25 a.m., the team tilted up the head of the operating table, turned off the bypass machine, and drained the blood from her body. Pamela Reynolds was clinically dead.\n\nAt this point, Pam\u2019s out-of-body adventure transformed into a near-death experience (NDE): She recalls floating out of the operating room and traveling down a tunnel with a light. She saw deceased relatives and friends, including her long-dead grandmother, waiting at the end of this tunnel. She entered the presence of a brilliant, wonderfully warm and loving light, and sensed that her soul was part of God and that everything in existence was created from the light (the breathing of God). But this extraordinary experience ended abruptly, as Reynolds\u2019s deceased uncle led her back to her body\u2014a feeling she described as \u201cplunging into a pool of ice.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the operating room, the surgery had come to an end. When all the blood had drained from Pam\u2019s brain, the aneurysm simply collapsed and Spetzler clipped it off. Soon, the bypass machine was turned on and warm blood was pumped back into her body. As her body temperature started to increase, her brainsteam began to respond to the clicking speakers in her ears and the EEG recorded electrical activity in the cortex. The bypass machine was turned off at 12:32 p.m. Pam\u2019s life had been restored, and she was taken to the recovery room in stable condition at 2:10 p.m."}, {"id": "cm7et5o", "body": "Not after they have zero brainwave activity.

In addition there are the cases where events outside the body are perceived, or even outside normal perceptual reach even when conscious. Finally, the cases with people on the operating table where no brain activity is measured (and indeed very little or no body activity at all), but they still manage to convey details of what happened at that point in time, which rules out the \"made up afterwards\" hypothesis. Or at the very least points to memories being generated with extremely little brain activity, which is very interesting in itself and could be a boon to memory research.\n\n&gt;As for why brains do this, it's presumably because the illusion of being conscious and making conscious decisions provides a massive benefit to the species. Much like the illusion of free will. It provides for a mechanism for feedback of learning into future decision making. \n\nThat's just speculation, and you've not supported why consciousness is necessary in that process at all.\n\n&gt;You're positing that somehow \"consciousness\" has a large metabolic cost. There's no evidnece that this is the case... it's nothing more than an emergent phenomenon of processes that the brain does for extremely valuable reasons.\n\nGiven the relative importance of the brain in the metabolism of species that we consider more conscious, that's no more than normal. Calling something emergent doesn't explain anything. It's like calling the ability of a computer to execute programs \"emergent\".

So if you're a Hindu then the conversation will be about remembering dying in a past life.  If you're Christian then it either has to do with a trip to Heaven or Hell.  If you're Islamic then it will have to do with Islam and Muhammed.  Until you can find a common thread among NDE's that is predictable and is true across the board for all NDE cases you won't see NDE's get much credit.  It's not to say that people aren't having an experience it's just that there's no reason to think it's anything outside of a persons own head.  \n\nYou mentioned that some NDE's have psychic side effects.  You can say it all you want but how are you going to prove that in a scientific setting?  Until you can 1) prove that psychic connections can occur and 2) prove NDE's are a situation that can make psychic connections occur then you're argument is pure conjecture.  \n\nAt the bottom you mention that you want to go after the closed minded skeptics about NDE's. The problem is that there's nothing to go after for the skeptics since they're the one with science on their side.  When a person dies we can verify their brain is doing something so we know the person is experiencing something.  But that experience in no way is proof of psychic abilities or an afterlife.  It's just proof that the brain is doing it's thing up until the last moments of life.  You also say that skeptics fail to provide information on this.  Why would we have to when the burden of proof is on you? We can clearly see the brain working in it's dying moments and that doesn't mean anything for psychic powers or an afterlife.

This is supported by the striking similarity between NDE's and Out of Body Experiences (OBE's) of which we have done quite a bit of study on, and do point to a more biological explanation instead of a spiritual one. There is also the possibility that she's lying.\n\n&gt; Next, how would you explain athiests having NDE's that involve God.\n\nBecause they're aware of religion, and so it makes sense for them to think of that with regards to them almost being dead. I'd be curious to know if the atheists see the god of their former religion, as if that is the case, it would lend credibility to my hypothesis. It would also agree with the many religious people who see their specific religion in the NDE.\n\n&gt; Finally, how would you explain particular NDE's where the experiencer meets spirits (entities) that relate to the experiencer their names and how they are waiting to be born.

You can prove brain activity and observe activity, and hypothesize links between those, and assume it means consciousness. But you can't prove it.\n\nYou are misunderstanding our current understanding of consciousness. Neuroscientists have identified a whole host of brain areas, functions, dysfunctions and disorders, and chemical effects related to consciousness. Damage this area, and you are conscious, but are without this faculty. Damage this other area, and you have these faculties intact, but aren\u2019t conscious.\nAnesthetics have been demonstrated to create a low frequency wave combined with a higher frequency alpha wave that is indicative of unconsciousness. Consciousness is a complex process of interconnected neurons and internal brain communication that produces, as you stated, a subjective experience of human consciousness. Each person\u2019s subjective experience is different, but each normally functioning person is objectively, conscious. The gray areas are the ones I alluded to earlier where brain damage occurs, and the \u201ccomplete\u201d consciousness experienced by normal people is not achieved.\n\nYou are injecting complexity where there needn\u2019t be any. You are taking the emergent property of consciousness and simply inserting a much much much more complicated explanation, that of some other worldly connection, where the evidence doesn\u2019t warrant it. \n\nA common analogue is that of wetness. What makes water wet? Is it an intrinsic property of hydrogen and oxygen molecules? No. Wetness is an emergent phenomenon that arises when a liquid of a certain range of temperature, with a certain set of chemical properties, contacts a tactile sensory organ. Does a person with sensory damage experience wetness? Or do you experience wetness when the water is 210 degrees? No. In order for your brain to register this specific experience as wet, you need a polarized liquid of a temperature that doesn\u2019t burn or overload your nerves to cling to your undamaged skin. It is this combination of events that produces the complex feeling of our hand being wet.\n&gt;That would be like saying that someone speaking and a computer playing an mp3 is the same because they have the same effect. You can't observe consciousness, that's what makes dealing with coma patients tricky.\n\nI don\u2019t understand your mp3 analogy. We understand and can predict how gravity will operate, but have not pinned down certain aspects of it (such as why it operates at the speed it operates at.) We don\u2019t have (non-hypothetical) gravitons to point to yet, so yes, we don\u2019t know exactly what produces the effect of gravity.\n\n&gt;That's circular reasoning, because you wouldn't call anything that you observed psychic.\n\nThis is absurd. Psychic abilities would be among the simplest abilities to test. You orchestrate a simple double blind test wherein all subjects choose a single random string of letters and numbers and securely store them somewhere where the \u201cpsychics\u201d could not access them. You then have the psychic group and the control group (random people) attempt to read the subject\u2019s minds in order to glean the character string. You make it double blind so that the experimenters can\u2019t assist the psychics. Easy as pie. \nWhat you are describing is the fact that people proclaiming to have \u201cpsychic abilities\u201d don\u2019t bother to define what they have, as defining it makes it falsifiable. Ever wonder why a storefront advertises tarot cards, palm reading, astrology, psychic readings and crystal healing? It\u2019s because they are all undefined hokum, and therefore one can easily be an expert in all of them simply by preying on confirmation bias and utilizing cold reading techniques. If someone genuinely had psychic abilities, they wouldn\u2019t waste their time charging $10 for a fortune, they would be winning poker tournaments and court cases.\n&gt;There are plenty of NDE's, anyway. You're well in your right to declare that you can't analyse them very well using traditional hard science methods, but declaring that nothing exists because your tools are not suited to the job is a bit of a sore losers mentality.\n\nThis is your most telling statement, and is the one that bests demonstrates the new-agey spiritual nonsense thought process the best.\n\nFirst, despite the fact that there are numerous mechanisms that explain NDE\u2019s, you, like OP, dismiss them without explanation. You merely dismiss the notion that they call them hallucinations and products of brain activity, without providing any just reason to do so, let alone an alternate explanation.\n\nSecond, since you have categorically defined NDE\u2019s as true, now you calmly assert that you can\u2019t measure them in \u201ctraditional hard science\u201d methods anyway. As opposed to what? Soft science? Oh, pseudoscience, right. Yes, you are correct that you can\u2019t analyze pseudoscience with actual science.\nThis is a good example of the disconnect in understanding of how science works for people with these views. There is no such thing as hard science. Science literally is simply observing a phenomenon, hypothesizing an explanation for that phenomenon, and repeating the experiment to see if the hypothesis predicts the phenomenon a second time. That is it. There\u2019s nothing else to it. So when you apply the scientific method to something and it doesn\u2019t reproduce the result, you move to another hypothesis. Now this isn\u2019t to say you don\u2019t try multiple times, you have to try a lot. But if something consistently doesn\u2019t prove to have any connection, you move on.\nSo when people report NDE\u2019s that are well within the range of possible brain-produced hallucinations, as observed in other instances of trauma or chemical effects, you don\u2019t need to unnecessarily complicate an explanation by injecting what is essentially magic into the equation. People who are in comas or are unconscious don\u2019t have their brain shut off. It has been proven that your auditory centers, your olfactory centers, etc are still active even during unconsciousness. So you can hear, smell, and feel things (assuming that part of your brain isn\u2019t damaged) while unconscious, but because some mechanism (trauma, chemicals, infection) is preventing portions of your brain from communicating in such a way that produces consciousness, you aren\u2019t conscious.\n\nFinally,\n&gt;declaring that nothing exists because your tools are not suited to the job is a bit of a sore losers mentality.\n\nThis is the most egregious statement that you make, and is right in line with other frustratingly hostile statements that I hear all the time from people who ascribe to new-agey stuff. It is nothing but spiritual dogmatism masquerading as something else. \n\nIf we were talking about Creationism, your statement would be: \u201cdeclaring that God didn\u2019t make the Universe just because your tools are not suited to the job is a bit of a sore losers mentality.\u201d\n\nYou, as well as religious people making assertions about reality without evidence are simply injecting your own desire for how you want to see the world work into the discussion.\n\nThe worst part is that you frame the scenario as a battle, where neuroscientists are the bad guys losing by not being able to explain something. Neuroscientists who have ceaselessly improved the lives of millions of people over the past few centuries with their persistent march of progress. Then we arrive at NDE\u2019s and suddenly this group turns into a childish crew of whiners who stumble across what would be literally the most important finding in the history of science and cover up or dismiss the evidence so that they can\u2026..they can\u2026..wait what is the motive for them not to share this discovery? You are making an appeal to conspiracy. That these neuroscientists go: \u201cgeeze! There really is all of this evidence for NDE\u2019s and we just CAN\u2019T FIGURE IT OUT. Well, let\u2019s not let those other people win, we will just insult them instead.\u201d\n\nAll of our advancements come from a simple principle. You apply the scientific method, and follow the evidence. You don\u2019t see anecdotes, apply your own personal explanation that adds in layers of complexity, and then assert conspiracy when subsequent experiments don\u2019t confirm your explanation.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cm7b0v3", "body": "I'm not gonna lie I won't be reading through all that stuff in the first link.  It is a nice list and it seems to cover a lot of in depth topics.  I'm going to bookmark it because it has so much and I would like to go over it but I don't have the time today.  My one thought about all this information is that it's easy to find the information you want on the internet. I could do the same to disprove psychic powers but I'll go back to the one source who's spent his life trying to answer this question for my information.  [James Randi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi) has been offering 1 million dollars to anyone who can prove they have psychic powers in a scientific setting.  To this day no one has been able to verify real psychic abilities.  You can show me all the papers you want but in a real scientific setting psychic powers have not been something that can be predicted or understood.  So until we actually see a psychic who can predictably use their abilities in a controlled setting I won't be giving any credence to the psychic part of the NDE argument. \n\nThe second article was interesting but it started off with the same problems I always see from NDE arguments. \n\n&gt; Ultimately, all materialistic explanations for NDEs must fail because they cannot explain the paranormal components of the phenomena, such as shared near-death experiences where multiple people share a near-death experience, and veridical near-death experiences where the experiencer remembers verifiable information that could not have been perceived with his normal senses even if he were conscious.\n\nThey start by trying to reference some greater beyond and say \"in a scientific context they're not seeing all the paranormal stuff\".  That's all fine and good to say that but until you can measure and test the paranormal the argument is invalid.  With that kind of argument you could say scientists just aren't measuring it against x thing and until they can see that they're just not getting it.  We're dealing with a scientific setting so the paranormal needs to be removed from the argument and we need to focus on things that are predictable and repeatable under the scientific method.  \n\nThe paranormal experiences can be written off pretty quickly because again those paranormal experiences are linked to a religion.  Religion is a geographical phenomenon so wherever you're born will dictate what paranormal experience you have in an NDE.  That tells us that the location of a person drives the experience which is evidence that everything is occurring in their head.  \n\nItems such as shared experiences I would have to read into further but I see no reason to take it as anything other than something happening in your head and as you share that experience people agree they felt it too.  I fall back to this argument because I used to date someone who really got into the pseudo-science / psychic stuff and I saw her try to push similar arguments with something called psychic emotional sharing.\n\nVeridical NDE's have a scientific explanation.  I saw a documentary a few years ago called Ancient Astronauts that did testing around this phenomenon by playing 2 different volumes of white noise into each ear of a person relaxing in a dark room. They were able to replicate the effect of Veridical NDE's which again shows me that it's something occurring in the brain."}, {"id": "cm7bjrx", "body": "Glad you found the links interesting -- I completely understand not having the time, and I appreciate your being willing to investigate it at all.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm not sure how much I trust 1) a magician who 2) has no background in science and 3) a million dollars and his public reputation on the line to conduct an honest inquiry.\n\nI'll be back with more later!"}, {"id": "cm7912x", "body": "I think the problem with NDE's is that they change dependent on the culture they're seen in.  So if you're a Hindu then the conversation will be about remembering dying in a past life.  If you're Christian then it either has to do with a trip to Heaven or Hell.  If you're Islamic then it will have to do with Islam and Muhammed.  Until you can find a common thread among NDE's that is predictable and is true across the board for all NDE cases you won't see NDE's get much credit.  It's not to say that people aren't having an experience it's just that there's no reason to think it's anything outside of a persons own head.  \n\nYou mentioned that some NDE's have psychic side effects.  You can say it all you want but how are you going to prove that in a scientific setting?  Until you can 1) prove that psychic connections can occur and 2) prove NDE's are a situation that can make psychic connections occur then you're argument is pure conjecture.  \n\nAt the bottom you mention that you want to go after the closed minded skeptics about NDE's. The problem is that there's nothing to go after for the skeptics since they're the one with science on their side.  When a person dies we can verify their brain is doing something so we know the person is experiencing something.  But that experience in no way is proof of psychic abilities or an afterlife.  It's just proof that the brain is doing it's thing up until the last moments of life.  You also say that skeptics fail to provide information on this.  Why would we have to when the burden of proof is on you? We can clearly see the brain working in it's dying moments and that doesn't mean anything for psychic powers or an afterlife.

As evidence, I consider 1) frequent reports of psychic phenomena during NDE (sceptics seem usually to ignore that, or simply say it's not reproducible or trustworthy ) 2) similarly - patients having NDE being able to describe details of surgeries that happened while thay had no brain activity 3) people who had NDEs are usually completely convinced that the experince was real and believe in afterlife, reagardless of previous beliefs (sceptics simply say thatm they're deluded, which seems rather closed-minded, even smug, to me) 4) similarly -  people who had NDEs often change their lives in some way and attribute that to the contents of the experince. (probably does not logically imply much, but it's still worth considering imho).\n\nFurther, it seems to me, that the sceptics failed to provide a resonable alternative explanation.

And that's through G-induced loss of consciousness, or G-LOC.  \n\nHere's a link:\n\nhttp://www.near-death.com/experiences/triggers06.html\n\nBasically, scientists can accurately reproduce the exact same responses many people correlate with the NDE, but though the very standardized way of knocking a person out due to extreme levels of G's.  Basically, they put people in a centrifuge, and spin it fast enough that a person blacks out.  The US Navy and Air Force do it with a solid fraction of all of their pilots.  They also ask each one what they dreamed about if they happen to pass out during their centrifuge training, so it's not like these static hypoxic events go without any form of documentation.  From these testings alone, one could reasonably say that the Near Death Experience is almost entirely a result of either the brain shutting down due to hypoxia (a loss of oxygen to the brain), or booting back up after a state of oxygen starvation - even going so far as to say that not everyone coming back from one of these hypoxic events has a simulated NDE, which parallels the fact that not everyone coming back from the brink of death has an NDE.\n\nSimply put, from studies already done by scientists, one can reasonably say that the NDE experience is almost entirely due to a hypoxic event, and that some people are naturally more conducive to these reactions than others.  I only gave one link, but from previous study, there is more out there if you simply google it. I refuse to put more out there, because I feel like if you don't feel like doing some of the legwork here, then you truly don't actually care to have your view changed.\n\nThere is, of course, the other things out there that you put forward that actually don't fit with rigorous testing.  This includes \"frequent reports of psychic phenomena during NDE\", where scientific evidence shows is completely false, yet cognitive bias makes us think is possibly real.  To briefly hit your other points:\n\n&gt; patients having NDE being able to describe details of surgeries that happened while thay had no brain activity\n\nJust watch some G-LOC videos.  [This guy has a vivid dream about being trapped in a maze](http://youtu.be/eMjjGgRLG8k) and he was only out for 30 seconds.  One things that is true about all of these events is that they're extremely vivid.  Sure, they knew they were in a G-trainer, but assume you're in a life or death situation...you might actually think that what you saw was a brief glimpse in to the afterlife.  There are others who say that they saw themselves in the G-trainer, yet never once have been able to label the sticker in the G-trainer that is out of sight of the person in the seat (wasn't able to find an internet link, but going off of actually doing the training and getting told of it from an instructor).\n\n&gt;people who had NDEs are usually completely convinced that the experince was real and believe in afterlife, reagardless of previous beliefs\n\nAgain, I said extremely vivid dreams.  Put a person in an actual life/death situation, then yeah....they might actually think what they saw was real rather than a delusion of a centrifuge trainer.\n\n&gt;similarly - people who had NDEs often change their lives in some way and attribute that to the contents of the experince\n\nWhy, though?  If the NDE showed them an image of the afterlife, and it showed them an image of heaven (as all pleasant NDEs people like to talk about do) then why change their life?  Clearly they're already going there, so why change if you're already going to ultimate paradise?  I'm curious as to how this proves your point?  People who have used drugs that induce a psychosomatic situation (like LSD, or similar drugs) have also experienced mental situations that have caused them to change their lives, so why are those fake but NDEs real?\n\nBasically, you're picking and choosing.  There are more people who have had brushes with death with no vision of an afterlife than people with NDEs.  Those with NDEs experience symptoms very eerily similar to hypoxic events that can be reproduced in a centrifuge.  And finally, the result of those NDEs aren't anything spectacular, and at the best are similar to those who experience deep character changing views that can also come from mind altering drugs.  So...what exactly is special about NDEs?"}, {"id": "2mstrw", "body": "I have read a lot about near death experiences and have watched videos with people who had them.

NDEs are evidence of an afterlife. A hypothesis is the starting point, not the end. A hypothesis can be disproven and that isn't a problem.\n\nA theory is an explanation of a hypothesis that is supported by experiment/observation. A theory can be disproven and that isn't a problem.\n\nWoo is belief, not science. Woo posits that a (extraordinary) belief is true, and then uses favourable evidence to support that conclusion, and ignores unfavourable evidence. Woo is all about certainty, and as such, proof that it is wrong is a massive problem.\n\nBelief isn't like the iterative improvement of science, it's all about acceptance. Belief isn't based on proof, it's based on the premise that a person switches off their critical thinking whilst believing.\n\nBelief isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many beliefs make our lives better. I certainly believe some things that I have no interest in testing (Infact, some of my most unpleasant experiences have been when a deeply held belief has been challenged).\n\nMy point is simple: belief isn't science, and belief has no place in the scientific process. If NDEs are evidence of anything, then we shouldn't shy away from that just because the evidence turns out to support something other than our preexisting conclusions.\n\n&gt; What is the current \"hard science\" hypothesis for the big bang? \"A quantum fluctuation in nothingness\". Metaphysics just is woo all the way down, there's no way around it. So either you swallow the woo factor, or you go back to counting atoms.\n\nJust because a theory isn't intuitive for you doesn't preclude it being correct. We have an incredible amount of experimental data and theory regarding quantum phenomena - the fact that it is counterintuitive doesn't mean it's wrong.\n\nJust because you don't understand a hypothesis/theory that isn't sufficient reason to dismiss it out of hand. We have tons of confusing observations and data that we have little theory to account for - and for science, that's a *good* thing.\n\nMetaphysics and cosmology are different things. Asking *Where did the universe come from?* is an entirely different (and IMO valid) question in both disciplines. However, only one discipline is scientific - cosmology is going to tell us what happened, metaphysics will attempt to find out *what that means to us*.\n\nIf you are willing to swallow woo, then why do you need science to prove anything? \n\n&gt; We all do, don't we? Do you think that people who believe NDEs are just hallucinations shouldn't be allowed to say anything about them either?\n\nI really don't follow how what I said leads to this. \n\nHow does saying the author holds beliefs that are colouring his conclusions a problem? I don't get it.\n\n&gt; There's a big gap between what bats see with their sonar and what we see when a bat flies around, but does that invalidate their experience? Or that there are indeed objects in the dark? If I have a radio and you don't, can you claim radio waves don't exist just because you don't see them and I'm just hearing voices in my head?\n\nThere's a big gap between subjective experience and that which is objectively measurable. All of your examples can be objectively measured (and for that matter, so can NDEs. We just need to put someone having one into an NMRI or PET scanner).\n\nAs for subjective experience, what use is that in our discussion? I can take LSD and trip, and the scientific explanation for why that is is irrelevant to my subjective experience - because it's about what I *perceive* rather than what's objectively at work. I don't care how the NDE feels as a subjective experience other than to the extent of its relevance to any scientific enquiry on the matter.\n\n&gt; \"Dying\" is too broad of a category to be applied to fringe cases like this. There's a variety of ways the body and mind can shut down, with a variety of chances of revival.\n\nDying is a quantifiable process. Whilst our understanding of the gradations and stages of that have expanded, ultimately dying is the cessation of biological processes that support our ongoing physiological processes (and cognition that arises from them).\n\nMany hypotheses of NDE work from the position that NDE is a state where the consciousness is liberated from the body as an independent entity. Science doesn't go about proving a negative (because that's inefficient), it goes straight to the assertion and tests it. Science has given people experiencing NDEs plenty of objective evidence to observe as their consciousness leaves their bodies and *not one case, anywhere, ever* has passed that test.\n\nOn the other hand, injured and dying people frequently experience hallucinations or altered perceptions. Human cognition and the perception that arises from it is *fragile*. I've personally had many experiences where my perception of a situation was impaired or altered - that's only proof of the fragility of my senses.\n\n&gt; NDE is literally Near Death Experience, so I don't see why it applies. Even so, why are you so eager to categorize it in preexisting categories already? We're still mostly collecting evidence and describing the problem at this point.\n\nIt doesn't apply because he was nowhere near death (by the clinical account given).\n\nTerms are important because they carry meaning. NDE has become a popular term, but it's a horrible descriptor because it incorporates a whole bunch of phenomena that have nothing to do with death at all.\n\nTo quantify is to place things into their proper groupings. If the categories are flawed, then they need to be reexamined. The act of quantification is not at fault.\n\nAs for collecting evidence, whilst experiments will always be ongoing, the scientific consensus is that NDE is not evidence of anything but an altered state of consciousness. I'm sorry that fact is challenging to people's beliefs, but that's just how it is - science is in the business of truth, not reassurance.\n\n&gt; Put a test mark on the wall too, and ask patients what it was too. Then you have a better base of comparison. People don't have perfect photographic memory, and filter their memories based on what they are about/concentrate on.\n\nPeople *don't* have perfect recall, which is why we rely so heavily on objective observations. People in altered states of consciousness especially don't have good recall. \n\nThere are ample visible objects (and events) within a clinical environment that a patient can be asked about, there are issues with having to alter visible test marks to prevent 'cheating' and to act as controls, there are issues with presenting what is a fringe theory with a credibility that is unwarranted within a clinical setting open to the public, there's flawed experimental design, etc.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the current testing methodology if you're willing to accept the conclusions of it. You're welcome to design better experiments - just know that a lot of very smart people have come before you in that, and your research probably won't pass peer review.\n\nI wouldn't say that subjective experience is useless, just that for it to be statistically significant it takes a lot of data, careful experimental design, and meticulous analysis of the data - and that's not easy.\n\n&gt; And that's an area of research studying these events can contribute to. Instead of dismissing it as an illusion from the start, why not defer judgment.\n\nI have no objection to scientific enquiry into the phenomena. However, I'm more than satisfied that fantastical explanations have been sufficiently disproved by the weight of the available observations. If you want to put a theory back on the table you're going to need more than what we've already examined.\n\n&gt; The reason why I linked this one was that they specifically kept track of oxygen levels in the blood - and kept them high, and he was able to compare it with morphine-induced hallucinations. So the usual \"it's just a hallucination caused by lack of oxygen\" doesn't fly here.\n\nOkay, so we have a *single* case study that indicates that hypoxia wasn't the likely causal factor in this instance. That's a starting point for science, but it's an ending point for believers like the author.\n\nScience isn't about suspending skepticism, it's about asking questions driven by skepticism. The vast majority of scientific knowledge we have today comes from people trying to prove themselves and others wrong. Science is about finding the flaws in theories. Coming up with a theory is easy - coming up with a theory that survives rigorous third party testing is hard.\n\n&gt; Well, then a lot of sceptics are faith-based, since they are so eager to dismiss everything that contradicts their certainty.\n\nI'm sure that some are, but as with all things it is unreasonable to tar everyone with the same brush. I could say that believers are all irrational, fearful, and self serving, but that would be an unfair mischaracterisation.\n\nSkepticism is a central tenant of science as much as acceptance is of belief. Neither is inherently wrong nor bad, they just occupy opposite ends of the spectrum and as such aren't going to have much common ground.\n\n&gt; Then we ought to research where the difference comes from. \"It's just a random hallucination\" won't do.\n\nHallucinations share qualities with dreams, so your question is similar to *why do we have nightmares?*. \n\nFor me, a really bad nightmare can be caused by nothing more than overheating during sleep - so I make a point to drink water before bed, and use fewer blankets (and I do that because I saw something occurring, I collected data, I formed hypotheses, and I tested those hypotheses until I had a theory that fit better than any other). I didn't buy into my subjective experience as having meaning beyond its merit, and given the outcome of my self experimentation I have been proven correct. \n\nMy point is that the *boring* explanation was right, and there was no need for any fantastical one - NDE is no different in that.\n\n"}, {"id": "2mstrw", "body": "I have read a lot about near death experiences and have watched videos with people who had them.

They would probably believe that this meant that obsolete computers went to some afterlife resembling this, but it's merely a feature of how that type of machine breaks down.\n\nAddressing the broader case:\n\nAnecdotally, humans seem have a common set of experiences at the point where they are injured to the point where their body is unlikely to recover, but there are lots of ways to interpret this. \n\nPossibility A: There is no afterlife, the brain is all electrochemistry. As other people have said, there are lots of ways for a brain to shut down which would induce certain abnormal experiences, and there are ways to induce similar experiences artificially with certain drugs. There are also lots of ways for a brain to die without experiencing anything (particularly if the brain is destroyed almost immediately.)\n\nPossibility B: There is an afterlife. Obviously if there is/are afterlife/afterlives that people can transition into continuously as they die, even when there is some possibility of rescue, then we should expect a few recurring scenarios to be reported again and again by people who almost die. But there are also lots of ways for an afterlife to exist in which you don't go there unless you are definitely irrecoverably dead, or until some special day when everyone is recovered, or whatever.\n\nWe can learn empirically about the relative probabilities and mechanisms in case A and set more precise odds, but I can't imagine what could possibly adjust our estimated odds for case B. If you run an experiment without establishing first what counts as evidence, then literally anything (and therefore nothing) you observe could count as evidence.\n\nI think it's worth considering that our ideas of what an afterlife might be are likely to be influenced by reports of people who have had NDEs - If you get your idea of an afterlife from culturally compiled aggregate of people's common NDEs and then take other similar NDEs to confirm it, you haven't done anything more than confirm \"this is a thing that some people experience when they nearly die.\"\n\n"}, {"id": "2mstrw", "body": "I have read a lot about near death experiences and have watched videos with people who had them.

By definition an NDE is not going to be a conscious experience, would you agree with that?  It is going to be an experience the consciousness must recall somehow in order for that experience to be conveyed to any scientific investigator.\n\nJung points out the extreme difficulty for collecting this kind of information because the unconscious part of the psyche must pass information through the \"filter\" that the consciousness imposes on ALL information it attempts to take in.  This pust any analyst of NDE in an extremely difficult position due to the extremely personal nature of a conscious mind's interpretation of the unconscious events.  There will be meaning in which the analyst will have difficulty determining due to the fact that they do not have access to the full history of all contents in the subject's psyche.\n\nSo in essence, that's the problem for the scientific community: since there has been no proposed hypothesis of the afterlife that is repeatably testable and the evidence of afterlife comes from recollection of NDE phenomena, the problem is reduced to the same problem in psychology of dream analysis, and things like addiction disorders, as difficult as they are to treat, show more promise in putting research efforts towards than studying the possibility that an afterlife exists.\n\nThis, and the fact that we don't know of anyone individual in modern recorded history, ever, who has returned from death for longer than some tens of minutes, but we know way more people who have beat cancer, addiction, ebola... all of this is evidence for researchers with big money behind them to focus on other things.

The scientific community has no time for \"NDE's\" because they are neither testable or repeatable. There is no way to to research on \"NDE's\", because frankly they aren't physical phenomena associated with it. The only research you can do is observing the brain while they happen, and there's no physical evidence in that to suggest anything is happening outside the brain.\n\nTo your points:\n\n1) Those reports AREN'T reproducible. No science will ever describe a physical phenomena whose event doesn't result in testable, reproducible, *physical* evidence. You aren't \n\n2) Again, eyewitness testimonial is not reproducible or testable. It cannot be used in science.\n\n3) People are easily tricked by many things, including their own senses (sight, touch, etc.) The strength of conviction in a belief does not affect whether or not the natural physical laws that govern our universe include that belief.\n\nI don't understand what you expect when you think people should be \"open-minded\". It is not enough to see that someone is strongly convinced of something to also be strongly convinced of it. Many people here are strongly convinced that you're crazy, and I'm sure that that isn't changing your beliefs at all. Perhaps you should be more \"open-minded\" towards their beliefs? No, I thin you use \"open-mindedness\" to conveniently describe believing in something that you personally want to be true before hearing any evidence for it. And science does not work that way.\n\n4) Anyone could change their life and attribute it to anything. It is **not** worth considering for evidence, because as soon as you accept one claim based on that reasoning you logically *must accept any claim based on that reasoning.* If you allow yourself to be convinced in one scenario by someone changing their life, but not in another scenario, you are essentially just choosing what to believe and not believe for no reason at all.\n\n\nIf you don't get the picture yet, science- the scientific method, requiring testable, reproducible evidence, having hypotheses peer reviewed, using statistics and math to describe the universe in predictable way- all of this is designed explicitly to AVOID the type of fake-reasoning you employ in your post.\n\nWhen you look at science, you see \"closed-mindedness\", and I will admit that it *is* possible that the process of discovering new ways of understanding our universe is occasionally slowed by our high standards. However the end result is that **we know that the things we believe are reasonable things to believe. We can trust them to be just as true tomorrow as they are today. They are just as true in New York as on the Moon and in the center of the Sun. We can use our current understanding as a foundation to build upon and learn even more.** Science isn't about finding the easy answer; it's about finding the correct answer."}, {"id": "2mstrw", "body": "I have read a lot about near death experiences and have watched videos with people who had them.

Of those people claiming to have experienced an NDE in these rooms, not a one remarked on or included the pictures - not a single \"...and why the hell am I remembering a bright orange tree-frog on to of one of the cabinets?\" or \"Funny....I remember something about horses....\".  This suggests they were *not* describing the rooms or events as they actually existed or occurred.\n\nWe've also been able to reproduce the \"dislocation\" feeling associated with an NDE through magnetic stimulation of the brain, demonstrating its organic origins.  This is in addition to the inducement of NDE symptoms through hypoxia as the brain drops from consciousness due to lack of oxygen.\n\nCome at it from another angle, brain injury often causes personality change and electrical brain stimulation can cause memories, emotions, sensations, and any number of effects.  When every aspect of your personality can be lost through the destruction of brain tissue or evoked through the stimulation of that same brain tissue, it stands in evidence that everything we are is a function of the physical brain - it leaves *very* little room for anything of *us* persisting past the brain's destruction.\n\nI'm all for further research into what happens during an NDE, as it can help clarify some very interesting aspects of brain function....but the evidence strongly supports NDEs have *nothing* to do with some form of afterlife and everything to do with the way the brain experiences its various failure modes on the way to death."}, {"id": "2mstrw", "body": "I have read a lot about near death experiences and have watched videos with people who had them.
