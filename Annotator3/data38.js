Because trying to hit them back is fighting, and you are not a fighter, you merely defend yourself and then, walk away.\n\n\"Grandpa, people don't fight like that, they swing and swing and swing and swing and.....\"\n\nNow you hit on an actual problem and this is where you need to learn things like counterbalance and using an attackers momentum against them. We spent that whole weekend with him teaching me Marine Corps hand to hand moves and Judo without ever telling me what these styles were.\n\n\"What if the person attacking you is a woman?\"\n\nRun. Just run, son. She clearly isn't thinking straight if she is attacking a man. This probably isn't her first time doing so. She has gotten away with this before or she wouldn't be doing it now. It is NOt your job to teach her a lesson about taking a swing at a guy. Just run.\n\n\"What if you can't run? Like on a school bus?\"\n\nWrap her up, pin her down, and call for help dealing with a crazy person. The longer you use your size, strength and weight to pin her down... the crazier she is going to become. By the time help arrives she will be in full on crazy mode, or she will be broken down and crying and you will look like the attacker.

Mods don't individually review every comment (there are too many comments and too little mod-time for that). So, *largely*, we rely on users to report comments which we do review individually.\n\n2. Except in rule violation cases (Rule 1, 2, 5, etc), such as when hostility or harm is directed at an individual (not a public figure), we do not remove comments based on content, even if it's sexist/racist.\n\nWhy? Because /r/changemyview is about changing the views of people who may hold these types of opinions. For you, it's an opportunity to change their mind about these views (yes it can be hard). If we removed all controversial opinions, there would less opportunities to change these views.\n\nWe are aware that sexism/racism can be offensive. Even if you are arguing against sexism/racism, you can be modded for violating Rule 2 if you are directly/individually hostile. We do not condone sexism/racism, and we remove all comments that are directly hostile at an individual, regardless of what side of a debate it's on. \n\nThis is how this sub is run, and yes, unfortunately, it's not a \"safe space\", but we there are other places on reddit that are \"safe spaces\" and do remove comments based on content.

The [r/changemyview wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules) also describes this:\n\n&gt;We deliberately avoid removing posts and comments if the only reason is that the view presented is offensive or controversial itself. We also can't remove comments just because the argument is made badly, is inaccurate, or contains logical fallacies. Doing otherwise would suppose that we were somehow the ultimate arbiters of truth or correctness, which we aren't. If you're rude and hostile to someone arguing that it's okay to eat babies, but they're otherwise being civil, then much as it pains us, we'd have to remove your comment and not theirs.

That's why everything from March Madness to the FA Cup to the NFL playoffs are so widely loved.\n\nSecond: playoffs give more teams a chance to be the champion.  Going into the NFL season, there are a lot of teams who feel they have a shot to win the champion.  Going into the college basketball season, there are 20+ teams that feel like they have a shot to win it all.  Going into the start of the Premier League season this year, there were 2 favorites to compete for the championship (Chelsea and Manchester City) and *maybe* two more that should have felt like they had a chance to win the league.  More teams feeling like they have a chance to win attracts fans and makes their games more exciting.\n\nThird: it makes a lot of regular season games more meaningful.  In most American sports with playoff systems, half the teams in the league would be eliminated from having a chance to win the title by the middle of the season.  The last week of the NFL regular season would be completely meaningless most years as the title would already be wrapped up.  There's not continental competition to play for in American style sports.  While you have competition for Champions League places, Europa League, the relegation battle, etc., all of the late-season drama in America comes from the playoff race.\n\nObviously both systems have their pros and cons, but the playoff system does a good job of achieving its goals in America, especially in the absence of continental competitions to compete for."}, {"id": "2mizjq", "body": "Correct if I'm wrong but all the major sports in the USA follows this format.

On top of that you have the Champions League which is build perfectly for a play-off scenario and teams from around 50 countries get to compete.

The motivations are different.  In the latter case, league games are significantly less important; maybe I manage/reduce the minutes of my best players to ensure they are fresh at the end of the season; maybe I feel that home court advantage is a big positive for my team and push for the top; maybe I try loose strategies to test them for the playoffs; maybe I tank the end of the season to ensure a better route in the playoffs.  The point being that the team with the best record at the end of the league is not necessarily the best team because maybe a better team had a lower incentive to push for the top.\n\nRelatedly, different team compositions can shine in one type of competition while being underwhelming in another.  I assume from your comments you are an English football fan; take Liverpool under Benitez \u2013 a team that never challenged for the premier league but would consistently do incredibly well in the champions league.  Was it a question of team mentality/attitude? Of good scouting and precise game plans tailored to the opponent?  Of focusing primarily on the CL while other teams spread their resources on more fronts?\n\nMy point is this: **different systems require different approaches to team building et al; consequently, the best team can only be ascertained once the system is given**.  Comparing results under different systems is wonky.\n\nI might agree that if you compare too extremes, league only with single-game elimination playoffs only, the former would statistically have a better chance of giving you the 'better' team at the end of the season.  But most sports build in some form of reiteration to reduce some of the luck element (NFL I guess being the big exception?).  At which point I think my point above remains.\n\nOn a separate note, but without going into too much detail, I feel money, and potentially contracting structures and other elements of the system also have a significant impact in ascertaining the best team.  'Best' to me implies a competition, and it is difficult to compare when one team spends double or triple on salaries/purchases than the next best team."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2miyay", "body": "On PC keyboards, the ctrl key is located in the bottom lefthand corner of the keyboard, meaning either an awkward pinky stretch or a full hand shift is needed to access shortcuts (ctrl + c, v, a, etc.). On the Mac keyboard, however, the cmd keys are located to the immediate right and left of the space bar, meaning they can easily be accessed by tucking your thumb slightly under your hand, or, in other words, by moving your thumb approximately an inch to the right or left of its resting position. Because the cmd key can be reached without changing the resting position of the remaining digits, the user will intuitively know where to reach to complete given commands and will be able to complete those commands more easily.\n\nIn this light, the piano raises an interesting parallel. The \"thumb-under\" technique is widely used to play keys on the opposite side of the index finger because the thumb offers such a wide range of motion. Conversely, there is no \"pinky-stretch\" technique (or at least it's not widely used) to skip a key with the pinky. Not only is this motion awkward, but it's difficulty is also compounded by the fact that the pinky is the weakest finger; a hand shift is typically advocated in these instances.\n\nIs there a good reason the ctrl key is where it is?

However, other medical illnesses aren't treated this way; if you go to the doctor for a routine check-up and your cholesterol is high, the doctor will attempt to intervene and the patient is expected to take the doctor's advice. The crux of my view is that I believe the same should be done for mood disorders. Please CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
