If someone wanted me to do an activity with them that I wasn't comfortable with because I've never done it before\n\nI think what you're saying here that there's a difference between wanting to do something, but not doing it for x reason, and not wanting to do something at all but being pressured to. Your example is inappropriate because it conflates those two distinct reasons. Saying that \"just be who you are\" supports not doing different things is only valid for the former situation; in the latter situation, \"be who you are\" is the assertion that you shouldn't change what you don't want to change to accommodate someone else. Similarly, if a person wants to lose weight *of their own volition*, but for some reason doesn't try to do so, then maybe changing for someone else will encourage them to act. However, if a person is fine with the weight they're at, then they shouldn't do something they don't want to do (lose weight) to please other people. I'm more responding to the notion that ceteris paribus losing weight is always the right thing to do. I think such a notion runs contrary to one of the fundamental principles of economics: what is right to do is *always* what nets an individual the greatest amount of benefit *according to their individual utility function*. Even if statistically everybody wants to be skinnier, if individual x doesn't, then losing weight for them is not the right choice, because it won't make them happier.\n\nI like your answer, except this bit:\n\n&gt; Sometimes it is fairly obvious\n\nAnd sometimes it isn't. What concerns me the most is that different people have different preferences for what size their partners are, and imposing those preferences on other people's bodies is wrong. The answer I was responding to was assuming that the only people who would be rejected for their size must be disgustingly unhealthily fat and deserve to die etc etc or who are otherwise \"obviously\" unhealthy. The reality is that some people have a body preference that can be unattainable for you (for instance, if a guy likes really small and skinny women, and you are average-sized at a good weight for your height, trying to fit his standards is likely to damage your health rather than improve it). That's why bro's blanket answer, that you should always lose weight whatever the cost, is wrong.*\n\n*also, weight is only one factor in the huge set of factors that determines an individual's health. If somebody's weight suffers because they are occupied trying to solve another problem (e.g. cancer patients who are very skinny, or people who take hormonal medication which makes them very fat), then de facto doing something to their weight isn't the thing most immediately helpful to their health, and may be detrimental. Also, people who try to do the best for their health but aren't necessarily extremely skinny (e.g. fat people who exercise - those exist) should't be shamed for not losing weight. But then I'm pretty radical. I don't think anybody should be shamed for anything."}, {"id": "cmxrusr", "body": "&gt; However, I see no downsides to losing/gaining weight to attract someone else.

So if that means you have to stop wearing the terrible punny t-shirt your partner doesn't like so be it, if it means they have to put up with the terrible punny t-shirt because you like it so be it.

With the recent stories about the Pirate Bay takedown and the assault on Sony, it seems apparent to me that the Internet has no laws, no justice and is run with a mob mentality.\n\nIn the case of the Pirate Bay takedown, the Internet has proven that it will not be restricted by laws passed by any government. The government raided the site of the Pirate Bay and confiscated everything. Within a few hours, the Pirate Bay was back online and running almost as if nothing had happened. I would compare this to the Mafia's control of alcohol during prohibition.\n\nAs for Sony's challenges, the Internet has all but destroyed the company's relationship with it's employees, stolen billions of dollars of information and continues to terrorize the company. Sony has now pulled the release of The Interview in a desperate plea to stop the bleeding. This seems like actions that the Mafia took against businesses which would not bend to their will and were destroyed.\n\nI see the future of the Internet following parallels like what was seen in Las Vegas, which was run by the Mafia from the 1950's through half of the 1980's. If you lived in Las Vegas during that time, you were left alone as long as you left the Mafia alone. You lived under the protective arm of the Mafia, you could walk the streets without fear of mugging, or street gangs. If, however, you got too close to the Mafia, or happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, you lost everything, or maybe even died.\n\nThe Internet is the same. You can use the internet without fear of losing your information or money. If you go into the deep web, or talk shit about hackers, you will be destroyed online. If you happen to work for a company, or have your data at a company that irritates hackers, you may lose everything.\n\nI'd like to see this differently, as having this understanding of the Internet means that the future has one of two paths:\n\nIn Las Vegas, the Mafia was destroyed (for the most part, that's all I'll say on the subject, if ya know what I mean ;) The Mafia was replaced by corporate control which has many of the same sins. Are we in line for more Internet Corporate control, with corporate hacking teams running the show?\n\nThe other alternative that I see is some form of government control, with government hacking teams exerting dominion over users. This seems the worst option, as they would bring ideology that would squash open voices.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Terrorist groups most often develop in spaces where people feel marginalized and oppressed, and when they feel like the group offers them the best possible solution to the problems in their life.\n\nThe problem with using military force to curb non-imminent terrorist threats is that it often perpetuates the conditions under which the terrorist group grew in the first place.  It's impossible to selectively kill only those which seek to do civilians immediate harm, without innocent casualties.  Drone strikes by the United States have killed hundreds (thousands?) of civilians and fostered a deep fear of the US among civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and other places where drones are being used.\n\nIf acute military action were the best way to stop future terrorist attacks, Israel would be the safest place on earth.  For decades, they've dealt with terrorism by brutalizing the perpetrators and anyone associated.  The problem is, the blowback from innocent deaths, and the continued economic injustices which are everpresent in the Palestinian territories, prove fertile ground for the recruitment of extremists. \n\nContrast that with Northern Ireland, which after decades of violence has had an enormously successful and peaceful past 20 years.

Motivation.  Desire and want and urge.  Most people never trouble over whether existence was our choice or not.  They simply *are* in an effort to raise a child or run a marathon or govern a country.\n\nWe all have a goal but there is no one goal.  In fact there aren't *any* goals other than those we imagine and decide for ourselves.  Experience is both the byproduct and the result of those goals.  It is both a method for learning and enjoying knowledge.\n\nYou ask why this would be more tempting than not existing at all.

We pick them because we like them.\n\nI point this out because it's a piece of some of your other thoughts.\n\n&gt;If we possess the ability to supersede our natural instincts why is it assumed that we should still strive to exist for as long as possible...If our goal is not to live for as long as possible, then why should we exist at all since such existence was never our doing to begin with?\n\n\nIn spite of this piece we can overcome our natural instincts although I would argue it requires a combination of experience, education (whatever form that may take), and self-awareness.  It also requires a security of resources.  You're able to attack these questions at this angle because you've hit a critical mass of these four attributes.\n\nYet you're asking because you're curious or confused or disconcerted by these ideas which is important because in spite of what may be considered logical conclusions there is an emotional motivation.\n\nTherein lies the answer to this question.  Motivation.  Desire and want and urge.  Most people never trouble over whether existence was our choice or not.  They simply *are* in an effort to raise a child or run a marathon or govern a country.\n\nWe all have a goal but there is no one goal.  In fact there aren't *any* goals other than those we imagine and decide for ourselves.  Experience is both the byproduct and the result of those goals.  It is both a method for learning and enjoying knowledge.\n\nYou ask why this would be more tempting than not existing at all.  To that I say you came to be whether you want to or not and eventually you will die whether you want to or not.  In this brief interlude between those two events, why would you turn down the opportunity to partake of existence to the fullest? \n\nRarely does a single person make a national or worldwide impact on our planet and yet it does happen.  Groups have a higher chance of changing the way cities and countries and worlds work.  History is full of such examples.\n\nFar more often individuals make small impressions on each other doing things which don't get recorded in the books.  They do these things for a variety of reasons although I would argue \"a greater purpose\" isn't typically one of them.  I don't think they're consciously concerned about their legacies.\n\nUltimately what difference does any of this make on your condition?  You are.  Why not be?"}, {"id": "cnfg5bh", "body": "Thanks for getting back to me. \n\nLet me reply by stating that a lot of these questions arose for me after reading the Stranger by Albert Camus. I struggle with the answers to the questions I pose, strictly from a philosophical perspective. \n\nWithin existentialism for example, I always struggled with the absence of suicide as a feasible option. It seemed as if the idea to exist superseded death, even if existence was just for hedonistic pleasure. To me it doesn't seem logical to arrive at the conclusion \"just to exist\". \n\nI think we can create purposes, and those purposes give us meaning and we exist to fulfill that meaning. However when there is no meaning, then why exist? To be clear that is not to be interpreted as \"you shouldn't exist\", but why can't we question if we should or we shouldn't from a rational perspective?\n\n&gt;  In my opinion you are stating a fact rather than pointing out an obstacle. I don't think this thought needs to be worked around. Instead I feel you should accept it as \"it is what it is.\"\n\nI've chosen to harbor on this point because it is a connector between us and other species. As far as we know species as close to us have no control over their existence. Each is placed on this earth and is left to exist in it as they can. However I argue that most of these species have very little control over continuing to choose to exist. To me they are motivated by natural instinct and act upon that instinct. We as humans can overcome our natural instincts. I'm not that familiar with biology but I'd assume that there are very few species that can do the same.  \n\nIf we as humans have an active choice in choosing to exist why is it assumed that that choice should always be to exist? I bring it back to our birth because if we are not compelled by our natural instincts we can question why it is that we exist in the first place. If we come to the conclusion that this existence is none of my doing and there's no other purpose for it, I'd think we'd be more inclined to question the idea you must choose to exist. If we actively contributed to that existence, I think it would be harder to rationalize not wanting to exist. \n\nTo me knowing that we had no input in our existence adds to the validity of arriving at the conclusion that existence should not be assumed. \n\n&gt; Our feelings aren't under our full control.\n\nDoes this mean that we cannot cognitively supersede what we feel? I understand that we have a lot of emotional motivation in our decision making, but is that too say that emotion must always exist? Do you feel that it would be impossible to truly be an existentialist because of this?\n\n&gt; Most people never trouble over whether existence was our choice or not. They simply are in an effort to raise a child or run a marathon or govern a country.\n\nI think this is because they never question it. Either because they've joined in on the belief that their is a purpose behind existing. Or (Atheists for example), they've arrived at the conclusion that since we will eventually die, why not exist (which I believe you've arrived at as well).  \n\n&gt; In this brief interlude between those two events, why would you turn down the opportunity to partake of existence to the fullest?\n\nI don't think that this is the question we really want to answer. I can give you a multitude of reasons why people can come to the conclusion that existing in this form is no longer desirable, but I don't think that's the point. \n\nWhat we really want to answer is if we can rationally question our existence. In other words \"Why wouldn't I question if I should partake of existence to the fullest?\" \n\n&gt; Ultimately what difference does any of this make on your condition? You are. Why not be?\n\nIn order to believe that I'd have to believe that this is the only form of existence I shall possess. If this is not the only form of existence then why not change or bail out of this existence for another?\n\nWouldn't that be a rational thought?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmzkr99", "body": "I mulled over your post for the last few days and I have some thoughts.

At some point this happens to just about everyone.  The wikipedia lists some causes and solutions for the thing.  These may reveal why and how to fix it for you, but don't go too far down the path and start to self-diagnose mental illness or the like.  Let's talk about it.\n\n&gt;The joy I feel doesn't outweigh the anxiety I have towards death. Since we are beings-toward-death, we leave in anticipation of it. It's inescapable. \n\nThis is how you feel.  It's your perspective on the issue.  Plenty of people are afraid of death yet not everyone shares your point of view on this.  Many people are not living in anticipation of death at all.\n\nWhy do you think that might be?\n\n&gt;Not being born means not feeling anything, and not feeling anything means not feeling pain, and pain is a stronger emotion than happiness...I believe that pain is more powerful than happiness. Pain should be avoided at all costs...When I refer to pain, I believe I refer more to loss. Loss of people. Losing people is the worst and you'll live the rest of your life feeling incomplete in some way. I will never be ready to lose my loved ones. \n\nPain is a physical and mental response to trauma although when you're feeling it pain takes on nuance.  Annoying, stinging, burning, aching, wrenching, stabbing, blinding.  Sometimes you see other people in pain and think you could easily handle it.  Sometimes a person's feather weight is for you unbearable.\n\nThis is another matter of perspective and, sometimes, tolerance.  Likewise the idea that pain is more powerful than happiness is just a point of view.  Some people are happy doing their own thing and some people are happy helping others become happy.  You'll see a lot of overlap.\n\nWhy do you think this is?\n\nSometimes pain and happiness mingle and we call it bittersweet as in the case of fond memories of family and friends who've passed.  Loss is a part of life and not a single person looks forward to it.  In a sense loss of a loved one produces the deepest recognition of their value because in this final moment we understand treasure a good person was.\n\nThe flip side of the idea is the treasure the good person *is* and how we might let slip precious moments if we're preoccupied with losing that person.  \n\nDeath is inevitable.  Loss visits everyone.\n\nIs that reason enough to dwell on the idea at the expense of the time which remains?\n\n&gt;As Sartre puts it, \"We are condemned to be free.\"\n\nYes he did.  But there is also Fyodor Dostoevksy who said:\n\n&gt;Happiness does not lie in happiness, but in the achievement of it.\n\nand;\n\n&gt;Man is fond of counting his troubles, but he does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought to, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it.\n\nWe have Franz Kafka, who said:\n\n&gt;A first sign of the beginning of understanding is the wish to die.\n\nand;\n\n&gt;You can hold yourself back from the sufferings of the world, that is something you are free to do and it accords with your nature, but perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering you could avoid.\n\nand;\n\n&gt;Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.\n\nSoren Kierkegaard with these words:\n\n&gt;Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\n\nand;\n\n&gt;Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.\n\nand;\n\n&gt;A man who as a physical being is always turned toward the outside, thinking that his happiness lies outside him, finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him.\n\nYou will find multiple ideas in exploring existence and they might all be correct.  What you choose to embrace, or succumb to, determines the outcome.\n\nIt's all a matter of perspective.  "}, {"id": "cmy2jlh", "body": "My god,  you are amazing.

In the U.K, immigration is consistently in the papers, our leaders are continually speaking about it, and it is *always* discussed on political shows such as Question Time. It's become so popular that we have elected UKIP, a right-wing party who advocates strong immigration policy, as our European representative, not to mention their continued growth in successful elections around the country.\n\nThe rise of right wing parties advocating stronger immigration control can be seen in many other countries - France, Germany, Spain etc, and these parties are all gaining popularity.\n\nFirstly, I think that as we live in Democracy, the will of the people must be heard. If immigration is consistently polling as the number 1 issue people want changing, if the rise of stricter immigration policy parties continue, and if people continue to protest (as shown in Germany recently), the issue *must* be adressed by government.\n\nI feel that isn't particularly the case. If we look to Germany recently - the protest was organized by very shady people, but the elected officials immediately branded those whom worry about immigration as in the same boat as the 'nazis in pinstripes' who organized the protest. Look at the recent comments made in France - people who worry about immigration are 'spiteful'. There's a continued backlash in many of these countries by the elected, which is often presented in ways similar to above - evoke themes of racism, patriotism (often seen as a dirty word in Europe), xenophobia in relation to anti-immigration worries in an effort to simply brush it away. If we take an extreme example - Look at sweden. The fear to criticize immigration is so strong that there are numerous examples where when newspapers report on crimes committed by immigrants - the blurred out, anonymized photos they use in their articles are actually *whitewashed*. As in, made to look as if the immigrants are from European descent. Sweden simply refuses to have any form of discussion on the issue.\n\nNot only do I find this problematic (and wonder if these parties are beginning to rely on an immigrant vote - sort of how the left in the US relies on the hispanic &amp; black vote), I feel it's counterproductive. When the government brushes aside these valid concerns, the populous who do worry will feel embittered and turn to their only remaining solution - these right wing parties.\n\nSo, my first two points are - that, as a democracy, the will of people must be adressed, and that the popularity of the issue and the rise of certain political parties across the european spectrum highlight how much of an issue this is. Further, there's a fear by politicians to adress these concerns, whether they be it simply for being labelled as racist or for some other reason, and that some politicians conversely use the labels just mentioned to actively shut down discussion.\n\nMy final point would be of that of culture. When I read threads and discussions about this, I see comments such as - 'so what? culture changes all the time, deal with it'. Many, siminlar in vain. The question I ask is - why should we? If these countries believe they have certain cultural identities, social functions and beliefs and attitudes, why should they not fight to keep those going? I honestly doubt that such a blaise attitude would be shown if a group of Europeans entered into African/Asian spheres and began to dramatically change the culture and society - no one would dare say 'who cares' for fear of being labelled a racist, or an imperialist, or some long winded 'think-peice' articulating on the ongoing effects of colonialism in a post colonial word.\n\nThere's a very clear and open public opinion that mass immigration is beginning, or has already begun, to effect european culture in negative ways. I think people are certainly within their rights to want to have this issue adressed. I think there are certainly truths within these sentiments - I also think mass immigration has it's positives. But I don't think those positives are worth the negatives, and I feel that with controlled immigration (instead of a system we have now), many of those positives will continue to be felt.\n\nSo CMV, Change my view!\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Firstly we live in a representative democracy which is founded on the principle that the majority of the populations would make very bad decisions about running the country, for example how many people do you think would end up with a decent pension if the government didn't do it. so we elect representatives who listen to our opinions and then decide if they are feasible or sensible and then decide whether to implement them or not. I imagine in a total democracy something like a highly punitive tax on wealthy business owners or bankers in London would pass easily. However as our economy is based around the city of London then this would be catastrophic. \n\nSo politicians have been listening they've just decided that strict migration such as UKIP suggests would be a very bad idea. This is for two reasons. One immigrants are net contributors to our economy, \u00a35bn was the recent figure(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29910497). Secondly one of the core tenets of the EU is freedom of movement and we are not going to be able to change that without leaving the EU another thing that would end catastrophically for us, it being the worlds largest single market and linked to 3.5 million jobs in the UK.\n\nI completely agree with you that maintaining our culture is a good thing but I don't think its the be all and end all and I certainly think that immigration is not the main cause of its degradation. I would be holding onto culture not national pride though. A main theme of our culture is immigration, we are a nation of immigrants: the Romans, the Saxons, the Danes, the Normans and right through to the great level of multiculturalism introduced by immigrants from all over the empire. Tolerance is what truly defines British culture. I know there were a few hiccups but the dismantling of our the empire was one of the most amicable ever. We still have the commonwealth,  it's very rare to see countries that were under the yolk of another on such good terms. I think that culture is what we should hold onto I don't think patriotism gets us anywhere other than isolationism, something I don't think is very viable in the information age. I think clinging to the arbitrary borders of where you happened to be born is pointless but the values of the people who you grew up with and around those values are what matters and they are the values of a nation of immigrants. We've nearly seen patriotism cause economic and social ruin once this year with the Scottish referendum but fortunately British culture beat petty patriotism.\n\nYou said that the rise of the anti-immigration, Eurosceptic parties was indicative of the peoples will. I would attribute it far more to disillusionment with mainstream politics the same thing happened in the 30s with the rise of fascism across Europe. Before I get shouted out Farage is not quite Mosley, yet. We see people feeling that their voices aren't being heard and turning to more radical options like UKIP. This has caused even more of a problem for the main parties as before they were content to ignore immigration because they knew the other parties thought that strict immigration was an equally bad idea but now with UKIP saying that they will do just that the main parties have to respond. So now we are in an unfortunate arms race between the political parties as to who will blink first on immigration and the EU.

It has mainly been Migration Watch and Civitas, and any politician at the time who used it as a source of information, whereby they accuse it of 'basic schoolboy errors' and basically rip the report apart as a pathetic joke and even 'worthless'. \n\nFirstly Germany and France were restricting immigration, it was soley because of this first 5000-13000 report that we didn't. As Jack Straw himself explains :\n\n\n \"One spectacular mistake in which I participated (not alone) was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the Eastern European states like Poland and Hungary which joined the EU in mid-2004.\"\n\n\"Thorough research by the Home Office suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be 'relatively small, at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to 2010'. Events proved these forecasts worthless.\n\n\"Net migration reached close to a quarter of a million at its peak in 2010. Lots of red faces, mine included.\" \n\n\"Other existing EU members, notably France and Germany, decided to stick to the general rule which prevented migrants from these new states from working until 2011.\"\n\n\n\nIt was the initial report that persuaded our politicians that everything would be OK, so they lifted the restrictions resulting in the ensuing chaos. \n\nSo this group, Cream, conjured up a report that has created one of the biggest mistakes in British politics in 70 years. Now people want to hold up another report by the same incompetent group and say it's factual?  I don't think so.\n\n It's a joke that the BBC even gave this second report any air time. It's even sadder that people are so ignorant that they will quote from it, having not even read it and not knowing who created it. As long as the BBC endorse it, it must be OK, right? Of course, the BBC receive millions in grants from the EU and have been notoriously pro-immigration.\n\n\nGood luck with the assignment."}, {"id": "2pkcvf", "body": "My own perspective is British, but this is something I'm seeing crop up in many European countries.\n\nThe topic of immigration is possibly *the* most popular debate going on right now. In the U.K, immigration is consistently in the papers, our leaders are continually speaking about it, and it is *always* discussed on political shows such as Question Time. It's become so popular that we have elected UKIP, a right-wing party who advocates strong immigration policy, as our European representative, not to mention their continued growth in successful elections around the country.\n\nThe rise of right wing parties advocating stronger immigration control can be seen in many other countries - France, Germany, Spain etc, and these parties are all gaining popularity.\n\nFirstly, I think that as we live in Democracy, the will of the people must be heard. If immigration is consistently polling as the number 1 issue people want changing, if the rise of stricter immigration policy parties continue, and if people continue to protest (as shown in Germany recently), the issue *must* be adressed by government.\n\nI feel that isn't particularly the case. If we look to Germany recently - the protest was organized by very shady people, but the elected officials immediately branded those whom worry about immigration as in the same boat as the 'nazis in pinstripes' who organized the protest. Look at the recent comments made in France - people who worry about immigration are 'spiteful'. There's a continued backlash in many of these countries by the elected, which is often presented in ways similar to above - evoke themes of racism, patriotism (often seen as a dirty word in Europe), xenophobia in relation to anti-immigration worries in an effort to simply brush it away. If we take an extreme example - Look at sweden. The fear to criticize immigration is so strong that there are numerous examples where when newspapers report on crimes committed by immigrants - the blurred out, anonymized photos they use in their articles are actually *whitewashed*. As in, made to look as if the immigrants are from European descent. Sweden simply refuses to have any form of discussion on the issue.\n\nNot only do I find this problematic (and wonder if these parties are beginning to rely on an immigrant vote - sort of how the left in the US relies on the hispanic &amp; black vote), I feel it's counterproductive. When the government brushes aside these valid concerns, the populous who do worry will feel embittered and turn to their only remaining solution - these right wing parties.\n\nSo, my first two points are - that, as a democracy, the will of people must be adressed, and that the popularity of the issue and the rise of certain political parties across the european spectrum highlight how much of an issue this is. Further, there's a fear by politicians to adress these concerns, whether they be it simply for being labelled as racist or for some other reason, and that some politicians conversely use the labels just mentioned to actively shut down discussion.\n\nMy final point would be of that of culture. When I read threads and discussions about this, I see comments such as - 'so what? culture changes all the time, deal with it'. Many, siminlar in vain. The question I ask is - why should we? If these countries believe they have certain cultural identities, social functions and beliefs and attitudes, why should they not fight to keep those going? I honestly doubt that such a blaise attitude would be shown if a group of Europeans entered into African/Asian spheres and began to dramatically change the culture and society - no one would dare say 'who cares' for fear of being labelled a racist, or an imperialist, or some long winded 'think-peice' articulating on the ongoing effects of colonialism in a post colonial word.\n\nThere's a very clear and open public opinion that mass immigration is beginning, or has already begun, to effect european culture in negative ways. I think people are certainly within their rights to want to have this issue adressed. I think there are certainly truths within these sentiments - I also think mass immigration has it's positives. But I don't think those positives are worth the negatives, and I feel that with controlled immigration (instead of a system we have now), many of those positives will continue to be felt.\n\nSo CMV, Change my view!\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That content, dating back to enlightenment ideals, is strongly in favor of individual freedom, including the individual freedom of movement.  "}, {"id": "2pkcvf", "body": "My own perspective is British, but this is something I'm seeing crop up in many European countries.\n\nThe topic of immigration is possibly *the* most popular debate going on right now. In the U.K, immigration is consistently in the papers, our leaders are continually speaking about it, and it is *always* discussed on political shows such as Question Time. It's become so popular that we have elected UKIP, a right-wing party who advocates strong immigration policy, as our European representative, not to mention their continued growth in successful elections around the country.\n\nThe rise of right wing parties advocating stronger immigration control can be seen in many other countries - France, Germany, Spain etc, and these parties are all gaining popularity.\n\nFirstly, I think that as we live in Democracy, the will of the people must be heard. If immigration is consistently polling as the number 1 issue people want changing, if the rise of stricter immigration policy parties continue, and if people continue to protest (as shown in Germany recently), the issue *must* be adressed by government.\n\nI feel that isn't particularly the case. If we look to Germany recently - the protest was organized by very shady people, but the elected officials immediately branded those whom worry about immigration as in the same boat as the 'nazis in pinstripes' who organized the protest. Look at the recent comments made in France - people who worry about immigration are 'spiteful'. There's a continued backlash in many of these countries by the elected, which is often presented in ways similar to above - evoke themes of racism, patriotism (often seen as a dirty word in Europe), xenophobia in relation to anti-immigration worries in an effort to simply brush it away. If we take an extreme example - Look at sweden. The fear to criticize immigration is so strong that there are numerous examples where when newspapers report on crimes committed by immigrants - the blurred out, anonymized photos they use in their articles are actually *whitewashed*. As in, made to look as if the immigrants are from European descent. Sweden simply refuses to have any form of discussion on the issue.\n\nNot only do I find this problematic (and wonder if these parties are beginning to rely on an immigrant vote - sort of how the left in the US relies on the hispanic &amp; black vote), I feel it's counterproductive. When the government brushes aside these valid concerns, the populous who do worry will feel embittered and turn to their only remaining solution - these right wing parties.\n\nSo, my first two points are - that, as a democracy, the will of people must be adressed, and that the popularity of the issue and the rise of certain political parties across the european spectrum highlight how much of an issue this is. Further, there's a fear by politicians to adress these concerns, whether they be it simply for being labelled as racist or for some other reason, and that some politicians conversely use the labels just mentioned to actively shut down discussion.\n\nMy final point would be of that of culture. When I read threads and discussions about this, I see comments such as - 'so what? culture changes all the time, deal with it'. Many, siminlar in vain. The question I ask is - why should we? If these countries believe they have certain cultural identities, social functions and beliefs and attitudes, why should they not fight to keep those going? I honestly doubt that such a blaise attitude would be shown if a group of Europeans entered into African/Asian spheres and began to dramatically change the culture and society - no one would dare say 'who cares' for fear of being labelled a racist, or an imperialist, or some long winded 'think-peice' articulating on the ongoing effects of colonialism in a post colonial word.\n\nThere's a very clear and open public opinion that mass immigration is beginning, or has already begun, to effect european culture in negative ways. I think people are certainly within their rights to want to have this issue adressed. I think there are certainly truths within these sentiments - I also think mass immigration has it's positives. But I don't think those positives are worth the negatives, and I feel that with controlled immigration (instead of a system we have now), many of those positives will continue to be felt.\n\nSo CMV, Change my view!\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even if you deported all immigrants tomorrow and literally never allowed them or their children to come back your culture would still change over time.\n\nI don't want to deport all immigrants, and I don't want to lose the benefits that immigration grants. I simply believe that we can achieve both of those with stricter, tighter, more controlled immigration that limits the cons whilst retaining the pros - something you continue to conflate with 'remove all immigrants'. And I think you're aware that there's a difference between the cultural shift of, say, 15th and 16th century Britain, and a cultural shift caused by an influx of immigrants of different cultures - let's not pretend they're one and the same.\n\n&gt;But I'm not looking for \"things that affect culture\" I am looking for things that damage it\n\nCulture;the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society.\n\nWould you deem faith schools as damaging to culture? Especially ones that extremely limit interaction with people different to oneself, like say, Islamic Faith schools? In Birmingham, UK, there was a very large furore over these schools and some of the teachings/beliefs being taught in them. How about the Rotherham scandal? A group of people with very different beliefs in regards to attitudes toward womens resulted in 1400~ young girls being raped - again, something that wasn't prevented because of a fear of being labelled 'racist' for targeting the individuals who commited the act. Or is that not, how do you put it, 'dangerous enough' for you? How about the protests and response to Salman Rushdie's knighthood? Should I go into other countries where we have issues of immigrants not integrating with the communities, commiting awful crimes, spreading incredibly anti-european beliefs and ideals? Belgium? Sweden? France? \n\nAgain - I don't want to pick on immigrants, and I'm not saying all immigrants are this way. These are the 'bad' stories, the worst cases, and an improved system in regards to immigration can limit these from happening. Better policy is needed.\n\n&gt;So the answer here is \"no\" then. Free speech is not being oppressed. You are meeting a cultural resistence to the things coming out of your mouth. But shucks, you're still free to express them, right?\n\nI guess so - I suppose Theo van Gogh met 'cultural resistence' to the things he created. Y'know, cultural resistence via 8 bullets to his person, partial decapitation, and having a knife plunged into the centre of his chest. And I suppose all those people who've been critical of a certain religion with fatwa's and death threats on their heads *can* still speak about what they want - they just have to deal with the lingering spectre of death hovering over their heads.\n\nI don't like discussions about censorship, especially the way you've framed it. It's a murky conversation where people have different ideas on where the line is drawn.\n\n&gt;What do you want governments to do in regards to culture? Force immigrants to adopt the mainstream culture? Whoops, now you're damaging their culture.\n\nWell, I've already stated what I want governments to do. Stricter policy in regards to immigration. I believe that would have a net benefit to preventing many of the issues I've spoke of.\n\n&gt; Force immigrants to adopt the mainstream culture? Whoops, now you're damaging their culture.\n\nWhich is more important?\n\n&gt;If you desire integration from immigrants you have to accept that they're going to be bringing their own customs and cultures with them. They're not going to suddenly change religions, or their way of living, just because they've moved to a new country.\n\nActually, no. I do expect them to curb their ways of living, *especially* if their ways of life are in direct opposition to the one of the country they now inhabit. If they hold beliefs that are categorically denounced as wrong in European countries, I expect them to change that belief or face consequences.\n\n&gt;I'm asking you. What is your fear in regards to culture? I'm not making a facetious argument here - I want to know why you think culture is in danger.\n\nWhat I think is irrelevant to my CMV - my post states that the majority of the population feel that culture is in danger, but those people aren't being recoginized sufficiently by their governments.\n\nThat said, I think there's some issues with the freedom of speech, I'm wary about certain attitudes I've come across in regards to women, I'm concerned with the issue of religion and the problems all that entails.\n\n&gt;So essentially, you're upset that culture is changing around you and you want to be able to direct it's change. Well tough luck because that's how it would work with or without immigration. Sure, you could go all Cromwell and legally try to impose your opinions on what the culture should look like. But in the end, people will still enjoy going to plays - so to speak.\n\nDo you want to point to where I said *\"I\"* want to control it? What I want is a democratic process that listens to the will of the people - a process which enacts the change that is agreed upon. I don't see that happening, despite the topic of immigration being one of the most popular issues for years.\n\nI think you should go back to my CMV post and read back on what I said in regards to 'culture'. I stated that, in discussions regarding immigration and it's impact on culture, the argument is brushed aside. I then asked why it should be, given that we wouldn't hear the same response if it was the otherside of the coin, and that polls have indicated that the populous have demonstrated that they feel strongly about this issue consistently. I then tied that back into the issue of tighter immigration control, another major source of public discontent, as being a viable solution to this issue.\n\n&gt;What does \"labour market performance\" have to do with integration? We're talking about culture.\n\nNo, we were talking about integration. And one of the key, if not most important, aspects is how immigrants integrate into societies economically - because that sets the precedent for many other aspects of the conversation (including culture).\n\n&gt;What would you find convincing?\n\nWell, if I knew that, we wouldn't be having this conversation now, would we?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmxkqiq", "body": "Very little of your post addressed my question.

They don't have the time to pursue something they consider worthwhile, which may be part of...\n3. They don't want silly flings or physical-only relationships.\n4.

Surround yourself with people who don't care about that.\n\nI found a thread a while back that really helped me, maybe you can find one similar, it was about people who were in the same situation as you and I, and the fact that it was evidence that we aren't alone, was comforting.\n\nHang tough brother, try to find a new hobby to occupy your mind (for me its skateboarding), you'll come right."}, {"id": "2pkb6i", "body": "23 yo MALE here...Will turn 24 soon. \n\nHave never been in a relationship with anyone. And when I say never..I mean never in all extent of not being in a relationship...Have never held hands with anyone. Barely go past having random conversations with the opposite sex. Have Not even been in a text-buddy kind of relationship if that sort of thing even exists. Have done multiple things to try and change all this. Things just dont seem to work out for me and I remain a Kissless Virgin.\n\nAnd when I look around I see all my friends and the people around me are so happy and positive because they have someone in their life.\n\nHere comes the kicker...I have even been told by some people(indirectly) on multiple occassions that having never been in a relationship makes a loser. At first I never really took that seriously, but now it started getting to me when I started realising this. Started becoming more and more depressed at the fact that I have never been with anyone...in all my 23 years on this planet...I have never shared anything even slightly romantic with the opposite sex, while most of my friends were busy having fun. I was all alone. \n\nSo CMV, Change my view on why a person who has never been in a relationship is a loser?\n\nThanks in advance everyone! \n\nCheers.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

How do you measure winning and losing? Is it money and power? Is it how much sex you are having? Is it in convincing someone to love you?\n\nWhat do you think of men driven into poverty after three divorces and paying a salary to each of those women? How about the Texan guy who will be forced to pay 1 billion dollars to his former mate?\n\nWhat benefit does a 'relationship' bring you? If you mean regular sex you can get regular sex from a prostitute. It costs about the same as maintaining a relationship, but sex is guaranteed each time, and its focused on your pleasure rather than hers. If you are only interested in regular sex a prostitute or learning to charm women into fwb or one night stands will suffice.\n\nIs it wealth and power? Does that make you a winner? The Pope is sometimes a virgin who is loved and respected by a billion or more people. Chances are that if you become wealthy at thirty many women will line up\nTo mate with you and try to have this 'relationship' that you find so important.\n\nHumans are evil egotistical animals, and everyone is looking to\nProfit. Men and women enter relationships to get something out of them, if they do 'love' emerges. I would say a 20 something with wealth, friends, and freedom is less of a loser than a 20 something tied to a pregnant demanding woman who isolates him from his friends and reduces his employment opportunities or ability to make decisions.\n\nIf you want to be loved move to a city with a large population and statistically speaking if you have some modest wealth a woman will decide to mate with you. But it is wrong to measure your success an winner or loserdom on whether a woman wants to show you affection. It often backfires and makes your circumstances worse.\n\nGeorge Clooney remained single for a long time, nobody can call him a loser. John Edwards was married and had a family, but cheated on his wife while she had cancer and many would probably consider him a loser now. He had a relationship, many homeless men had relationships and in some cases the women took everything they had, that Iranian terrorist fuck\nIn Sydney had a wife and kids, who he murdered, and was clearly a loser before and after he met that poor unfortunate woman\n\nTl:dr: a relationship with a woman is not a success, and lack of a relationship or a woman does not make someone a loser by any measure "}, {"id": "2pkb6i", "body": "23 yo MALE here...Will turn 24 soon. \n\nHave never been in a relationship with anyone.
