If our ancestors thought like you did and didn't want to bring a child into a troubled world, you might not even be alive today. People have historically had to deal with a lot of pain and suffering. It is an unfortunate side effect of the human condition, but to question whether we should continue bringing children into the world because of this pain and suffering is to question the legitimacy of the human race. That line of thinking can only lead to nihilistic conclusions. Every generation of humans has faced problems, and most of them have persevered. We have simply had to improve our conditions bit by bit, and adapt to new environmental, social, economic, and political realities.\n\nIf you recognize the problems and immediacy of climate change and teach your child about it, your child is likely to live sustainably, and will potentially persuade others to live sustainably as well. The impact of one person on the planet is far less than the potential for people to change the impact of others. if we ever want to solve the problem of climate change (and unsustainability as a whole), it is important that as many people as possible take it seriously and recognize it as fact. Education plays a key role in this, but parents are also an important piece in the puzzle.\n\nIn terms of overpopulation concerns, you can have 1-2 children and remain under population displacement level. If this is still a concern for you then you might consider adoption. That way you can raise a child without the associated guilt of bringing them into a changing world or contributing to overpopulation. I personally plan to have one child naturally and adopt another of the opposite gender. \n"}, {"id": "2nz6pz", "body": "I really want my view changed here. Badly.

Metaphysically, there isn't any reason why something cannot *simply be* objectively meaningful. (At least, none that I've heard.) If this doesn't make sense to you, then for whatever answer you gave for the first question, ask \"but what makes *this* the answer?\" For example, if your answer is that God has ordained something meaningful, then ask, but why does God ordaining it make it objectively meaningful? At some point, if you believe in objective meaning at all, you will reach your \"it simply is\" moment. Non-theists can say that the happiness you are your family and close friends share on certain occasions *simply is* meaningful, objectively. Another point: meaning and significance need not be *cosmically significant* or eternally significant; life can still matter in the here and now, and for some (probably brief) period after our lives are over.\n\nOn my (non-theistic) worldview, there is no reason why my relative cosmic insignificance leads me to depression.

Even if there is no heaven or hell, everyone is going to die eventually.  If you just focused on these things they would inevitably make you feel depressed.

The protection doesn't exist because homosexuals are/were in need of jobs, but because their sexual orientation was being used as means for not hiring them rather than their qualifications. \n\nAgeism is the same. It's not an issue of employment statistics, but rather valid or invalid reasons for not hiring somebody, or for firing them. When young people don't get hired it isn't because of their age; it is because of their inexperience. They are certainly cheaper and have more energy, so it would make sense to hire them into any job on that basis; except they lack the experience that years on the job give you. That is relevant.\n\nBut not hiring somebody who does have experience because they are older and may have more medical problems, or closer to retirement, etc., well, that's discrimination if it doesn't affect their job performance.

In Griggs, the Supreme Court ruled that the employer has the burden of proof of necessity of any test that has a disparate impact on different ethnic groups.  If the same criteria were used for youth as for race, the employer would have to be very careful to use the least-discriminatory methods possible to assess experience.  Measurement as 'time spent' would be far too crude to be acceptable."}, {"id": "cmi1xdf", "body": "Requiring N years of experience would be a slam-dunk case of illegal discrimination if youth were actually treated as a protected class in the way that race/religion/etc are."}, {"id": "cmibw9d", "body": "Age gets rational basis whether you're old or young.  I don't know what OP means by 'protected class.'  Everybody is technically protected to some extent, but usually we use that phrase to refer to heightened protections above rational basis.  Age - old or young - gets rational basis.  It's in the least protected tier of scrutiny.\n\nThe ADEA doesn't change the rational basis classification; it just creates enforceable rights and remedies for people that meet its threshold, part of which is being over the age of 40.  There are tons of exemptions (e.g., policy-makers and CEOs) and it's generally very hard to prove a claim under the statute precisely because all the employer (usually) needs to do is show their policies were reasonable (with an extra wrinkle for constructive discharge claims.)  If there's a reasonable factor other than age, the policy will probably hold, even if there is disparate impact.\n\nLet's pretend that people under 40 had the same enforceable rights and remedies.  We'll use your example of requiring X amount of experience.  We'd probably go after this as a disparate impact claim.  A 25 year old applies for a job and doesn't get it.  The reason is his lack of experience.  Younger people almost always have less experience because they've been in the workforce less time.  This is going to disproportionately affect (disparate impact) younger people more than older people even if that's not the purpose of the policy.  Is it reasonable to hire people with more experience than not?\n\nSure, it is.  People with more experience probably require less training.  They probably have an established network or client base.  They probably have foundational knowledge so they can hit the ground running.  Overall, they're more likely to yield a faster return on investment.  These probabilities are all reasonable grounds besides age for a company to make its hiring decision.  The policy holds.\n\nThis is an analysis taken from actual case law where city police officers over the age of 40 brought a disparate impact claim under the ADEA because they were getting smaller pay raises than their younger counterparts.  The city's reason behind this was to keep with regional averages.  The court found it was reasonable even if it affected older people more than younger.  There was some other rational (reasonable) basis for the city's decision besides age.  The policy holds.\n\nThink of it like the ADA:  disability still gets a rational basis review but the ADA creates specific, enforceable rights and remedies against private parties for people who have disabilities.  These statutes don't change the standard so much as make them applicable against parties that are not traditional state actors and, consequently, would not otherwise be held to constitutional standards and norms such as equal protection.\n\nAge does not and never, ever will receive the same heightened scrutiny of race and nationality.  Even sex only gets quasi-suspect classification and that's something you're (arguably) born with.  Age is not a discrete and insular minority, has no history of political powerlessness, no history of purposeful unequal treatment, and most people will be the age in question at some point so it's not its own group.

But this isn't. This is a CMV about the discrimination law. \n\nYou have plenty of problems with how young people have it hard, but in most cases, the older person relaunching is harder than the younger person launching or relaunching.

Not only do they not have it, often they have responsibilities on top of it.\n\nIn regards to your* problems about 'unreliability' - I doubt this is strictly a problem with 'young people' as a general class and can also be clumped into 'inexperienced.'

If you're running a business, and you have a job position open and get applicants with experience and someone without, then you hire the person with experience. Sometimes, you hire the person with ANY work experience. The best indicator of future behavior is past behavior. So how do young people adjust? They get education or they go out and try to do things on their own. \n\nNow I will agree with you, these days it is tough for young people. But being tough for young people doesn't mean that old people in a particular situation don't also have it tough, and it doesn't mean that these laws are dated. Part of the reason young people have iot* hard is that old people are staying in their jobs for longer. If they don't leave, people don't get promoted, and there are just simply less low lever positions. Now, that doesn't just categorically effect young people, that effects ANYONE looking for a job in a industry they don't have experience in. I don't see that as discrimination, but I do see that as a problem with possible answers.\n\nSo - I agree that young people may have it tough, but in all of your situations an old person in the same circumstances would have it tougher given the circumstances having less experience.

Even take a low level job like a barista. If the barista knows a lot about the different kind of coffee drinks and has already developed the ability to make them, the employer wouldn't have to spend WAGES to train that person. However, the inexperienced person can learn both those things, but it costs wage hours and resources (milk, coffee, waste caused by mistakes) to get that inexperienced person up to par. \n\n&gt; you have to explain to me what laziness has to do with level of experience.\n\nIf you have no work experience, you haven't spent anytime investing into relevant experience. Of course, if a person has spent no time investing in their future, they are considered lazy regardless of age. If the person is young, he is perceived as being lazy only in virtue of him not having gained any experienced. I can see that a person can associate youth with lazy given that a lot of youth they observe are not acquiring experience. But once gained experience, the person isn't considered lazy. One might think that kids these days are all WOW addicted good for nothings, but come time to hire and you see someone who spent the last 5 years going to community college, transferring to university, and worked that entire time, your perception is changed because they have experience. There efforts are incompatible with them being lazy.\n\n Now, an additional argument is that the old person can also be perceived as being lazy. A hiring manager looking to hire an older person versus a younger person can look at the older person and say, \"This is a low level position, you should be doing something way above this by now. That's lazy that you aren't doing that other thing.\" In that case, it is clear the experience is what is relevant. Him being old is an additional factor because there is a value judgment of how that older person spent his time. But guess what, he was content with his car factory job that paid him enough to be considered middle class. He shouldn't be considered lazy just because they closed the factory, maybe short sighted, but he surely was working hard the entire time. In that case it is in virtue of age, not prior experience, that the older applicant would be considered lazy NOT merely based on having experience, but the kind of experience he has. \n\nIn regards to your example, I highly doubt that has ever really happened. For one, if the 35 year old only had 3 years of relevant experience, there would be a slew of other concerns the employer would have about hiring this guy. What did he do for the last 10 years after he got out of college? That's a big gap in your story, and it isn't trivial to the conversation. The 35 year old has 10 more years of life experience that you are simply leaving unaccounted for. In that case, the employer would look at the applicants and say, \"Wow, this kid has just as much experience. We can train him up and we can work him in this company for quite some time.\" But honestly, I never heard of someone being considered for a manager job from outside the company with only three years of experience. That premise seems kind of ludicrous to begin with. Another thing to consider is that many mothers returning to the work force have this same problem. Yes, raising a kid is a valuable life experience, but not having relevant work experience does hurt your human capital. Men could be hired more than this class of women in virtue not of stigma, but that the men applicants are simply more qualified having not had to spend the time raising the kids. \n\nFinally, I think you have some very vague notions of 'fit the bill.' I don't really agree that all other protected classes are known to have negatively desperate outcomes in employment. I am sure that there are plenty of employed Muslims. What is wrong about not hiring a Muslim isn't that they are at some kind of statistical disadvantage, but that they are judged on something that isn't relevant to the job. And that there are old people who have good outcomes is irrelevant, the law doesn't defend them. That's like me saying that because Oprah and Jay-Z have it well off, black people shouldn't be a protected class. The question shouldn't be about statistical relevance, because most protected classes are statistically irrelevant. Most people aren't disabled, most people aren't homosexual, yet those are two classes which warrant protection. The question is does the law protect? And the elderly law does protect. This is the point relevant to your CMV.\n\nWhile not entirely relevant to your CMV: I agree young people should have laws that protect them, but not anti-discriminatory laws. Instead, they should have a bolster of legislation that enables them to gain relevant experience without the high costs. I believe our society should be funding education significantly more than we currently are, and that the amount of debt that people are incurring to just simply make it in our society is ridiculously large and borderline oppressive. This wouldn't just true of young people, but anyone trying to use education as a means of gaining relevant experience (older people, mothers, etc).

However, I don't think that her subjective happiness or financial means is the goal of punishment. Punishment doesn't merely exist for victims, one of its most important functions is to be a deterrent for other people. The other husbands in the NFL are thinking \"If I do this I will be suspended\" not \"if I do this is it worse than her having millions of dollars?\" Let's be honest, I'd probably let somebody punch me in the face for 100,000. That doesn't mean that I think that should be legal or moral. \n\nThe NFL also really needed to take a stand that this behavior is wrong. Beating spouses is wrong, and I think you're wrestling with what a lot of victims wrestle with of weighing the decision to leave vs. staying and having income, a stable home, love, etc. But the NFL is in a weird position because their players are, for better or worse, looked up to.
