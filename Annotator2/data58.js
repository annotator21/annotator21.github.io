People would suffer severe injuries or die while on the job due to poor safety procedures. Even those that were extremely careful still suffered from poor health conditions as a result of dust and other environmental hazards. Work hours were often 10+ hours long, without breaks. Wages were even worse than they were now as there was no minimum wage. Those that voiced their opinion about the situation would simply be fired and replaced. To put things simply, work back then was hell. \n\nThis harsh environment led to a push for workplace regulations that set standards for safety, employee compensation, and who could be hired.\n\nAs most jobs were in factories, which at the time had horrible working conditions, work was seen as a hazardous environment. As such, it was seen as a necessary action to prevent child labor. Exposing children to conditions that put their lives,  health, and well being at risk was definitely something that needed to be prevented. It was a necessary action, and considering that it was their primary means of employment, other safe jobs may not have been considered.\n\nEntry-level factory jobs aren't quite as large as they once were due to computer programs and automation replacing people, and the jobs that do exist usually require some form of basic training.\n\nNowadays, there are plenty of employment opportunities that have little to no hazards involved. Retail and food service positions carry minimal risks to health.\n\n\nI believe the only jobs that should require an age of 16+ or 18+ are those that pose a risk to the employee. Things such as working with electronics, factory machines, welding, automotive engines, etc. Anything that can cause significant harm as a result of mistakes should remain 18+.\n\nFolding/Hanging up clothes at a clothing store or making a sandwich wrap isn't going to cause any harm at all, even in the case of extreme stupidity.\n\nI'm not saying anyone should be employable at any age, but rather that the current situation is too strict. One shouldn't have to be 15/16 to perform basic tasks.\n\nWhen I was 13 I was already doing freelance programming online. My age was a secret, of course, but it didn't make a difference. I completed projects based on instructions and maintained professional communication. If someone like me can perform skill-based jobs at a competitive level at the age of 13(shit pay though since it was freelance and I was a novice), I'm sure others are capable of completing the basic, competitive tasks that a retail or food service job requires.\n\nI also feel like allowing people to begin working at a younger age builds character. Working for a business, even if its just simple tasks, teaches you crucial values that you will use in future careers, and it leads you to appreciate what you have. When I got my first job at a PC repair shop at the age of 18, I suddenly began to appreciate everything I had. Prior to that I was quite spoiled, and took everything my parents bought for me for granted. It also gave me a sense of self-worth, as I knew I was doing something for the better(fixing people's computers and stuff).\n\n**edit:** Additional regulations would need to be put in place to improve upon it, but I feel like a few additional policies as described in my comments below could result in better youth development and a better economy.\n\nSo yeah, please CMV."}, {"id": "cmif715", "body": "For your points regarding safety, I agree.

Working for a business, even if its just simple tasks, teaches you crucial values that you will use in future careers, and it leads you to appreciate what you have. When I got my first job at a PC repair shop at the age of 18, I suddenly began to appreciate everything I had. Prior to that I was quite spoiled, and took everything my parents bought for me for granted. It also gave me a sense of self-worth, as I knew I was doing something for the better(fixing people's computers and stuff).\n\n**edit:** Additional regulations would need to be put in place to improve upon it, but I feel like a few additional policies as described in my comments below could result in better youth development and a better economy.\n\nSo yeah, please CMV."}, {"id": "cmifhmv", "body": "The chief concern with age restrictions isn't the labor itself but the number of hours one puts in.

I don't think there's anything wrong with asexuality or bisexuality or any form of -sexuality that doesn't hurt someone. I am biromantic and I can sort of understand being heteroromantic or homoromantic. But I have not heard a description of aromantic that does not make me feel like those people need help. \n\nFrom my perspective, romantic attraction is just a natural extension of normal love, like the love you have for your friends or family. To fall in love means to trust and care about someone else even more than you do about your friends, enough to want to spend your life with them and dedicate a significant amount of your time and resources to their happiness and your mutual happiness. I think love is very important to being mentally and emotionally healthy. I don't think you can be emotionally healthy if you don't have any friends, if you shun people and never express love. So when people say that they are physically incapable of loving and trusting someone enough to enter a romantic relationship, I feel like something has to have gone wrong. \n\nSexuality is one thing. Sexuality is about physical response and physical acts, it is who turns you on and who you want to have sex with. Bodies are weird things, physical reactions can range into bizarre in most situations (I mean, consider allergies) and the actions people take are their own business (again, so long as nobody's getting hurt). But romantic feelings are based in emotion and thought and when something is very different with emotion and thought, when you are *lacking something* that most people have that has to do with emotion and thought, we call it a mental disorder. People who are lacking the ability to properly control their motivation and attention have ADHD. People who are lacking the ability to feel alright most of the time have Depression or Bipolar disorder. People who are lacking the ability to distinguish reality are schizophrenic or have delusions. So why are people who are lacking the ability to form romantic relationships...considered fine? \n\nWhy is there a disconnect between the view of someone who can't make friends (such as those with [Schizoid Personality Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder), which we do consider problematic) and people who can make friends but can never take it any further than that (people with Aromanticism, which we don't consider problematic)?\n\nI guess the crux of my argument is that I believe there are different kinds of love of varying strengths. Love for your mom, for your grandma, for your aunt, for your best friend, for inanimate things. And I think romantic love is kind of the epitome of it, something to strive for. It's one thing to not be in love or not be looking for love, but to say you're actually just totally incapable of it? I call that mental illness.\n\nChange my view?\n\n**EDIT: Thank you, /u/nikoberg.

I feel like romantic love is generally such a large part of life that it's a little crazy to say that life is exactly as good without it. Look at how many movies, songs, books, webcomics, stories, plays, not only explore it but just offhandedly mention it because it's *expected*. Can something so integral to our society and our idea of what it means to be happy really not increase our happiness at all?\n\n&gt; What makes romantic love more important than love for your friends or family?\n\nI'm not arguing it's the most important thing in the world. I'm just arguing that it *is* important. So to answer your question with a question: What makes it less important than love for your friends or family?\n\nIf someone couldn't make friends, most people would consider that a problem that needed fixing. If someone claimed they were physically incapable of feeling friendship, most people would consider that a serious problem and maybe a sign of psychopathy. If someone's family wasn't abusive and the person didn't care about them at all, treating them like strangers and never going to weddings or funerals or deathbeds, they would also be seen as having a problem and being a horrible person. Why do you consider romantic love so *un*important that lacking it doesn't matter at all, when all the other forms of love are vital and lacking it is huge?"}, {"id": "cmirb18", "body": "I would think distress is purely personal.  If you feel you are distressed, you are, and if you don't, you aren't.  Even if, upon comparison, an outside source disagreed, their opinion would be meaningless.  This of course is assuming the person wouldn't lie about their feelings."}, {"id": "2nzufr", "body": "I don't want to believe this, I've tried to find a good counterargument, but this is how I feel. I don't think there's anything wrong with asexuality or bisexuality or any form of -sexuality that doesn't hurt someone. I am biromantic and I can sort of understand being heteroromantic or homoromantic. But I have not heard a description of aromantic that does not make me feel like those people need help. \n\nFrom my perspective, romantic attraction is just a natural extension of normal love, like the love you have for your friends or family. To fall in love means to trust and care about someone else even more than you do about your friends, enough to want to spend your life with them and dedicate a significant amount of your time and resources to their happiness and your mutual happiness. I think love is very important to being mentally and emotionally healthy. I don't think you can be emotionally healthy if you don't have any friends, if you shun people and never express love. So when people say that they are physically incapable of loving and trusting someone enough to enter a romantic relationship, I feel like something has to have gone wrong. \n\nSexuality is one thing. Sexuality is about physical response and physical acts, it is who turns you on and who you want to have sex with. Bodies are weird things, physical reactions can range into bizarre in most situations (I mean, consider allergies) and the actions people take are their own business (again, so long as nobody's getting hurt). But romantic feelings are based in emotion and thought and when something is very different with emotion and thought, when you are *lacking something* that most people have that has to do with emotion and thought, we call it a mental disorder. People who are lacking the ability to properly control their motivation and attention have ADHD. People who are lacking the ability to feel alright most of the time have Depression or Bipolar disorder. People who are lacking the ability to distinguish reality are schizophrenic or have delusions. So why are people who are lacking the ability to form romantic relationships...considered fine? \n\nWhy is there a disconnect between the view of someone who can't make friends (such as those with [Schizoid Personality Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder), which we do consider problematic) and people who can make friends but can never take it any further than that (people with Aromanticism, which we don't consider problematic)?\n\nI guess the crux of my argument is that I believe there are different kinds of love of varying strengths. Love for your mom, for your grandma, for your aunt, for your best friend, for inanimate things. And I think romantic love is kind of the epitome of it, something to strive for. It's one thing to not be in love or not be looking for love, but to say you're actually just totally incapable of it? I call that mental illness.\n\nChange my view?\n\n**EDIT: Thank you, /u/nikoberg.

What if the tables were turned and they could feel intense romantic love but not casual friend love, so they couldn't form friendships? Wouldn't that be an issue?\n\nPossibly, but not because they're \"missing out on experiences.\" I, personally, will never know what it's like to be female. And for that matter, I won't really know what it's like to enjoy sex with a female, because my tastes don't lean that way. You could say in a sense that I'm missing out, and if I were bisexual or a different gender I would get a fuller experience of life. But I don't particularly have any desire to change my orientation, or my gender; not experiencing that doesn't bother me, and I have a feeling you likely feel the same way. I don't meaningfully suffer because of my inability to experience something that another human being can. \n\nThe issue, if it existed, would be because it's probably that someone who can't form friendships would be bothered by it, and would suffer harmful dysfunction in everyday life. Now, if this turned out not to be true, then sure, we could say it's harmful. But the key point is that we have to judge based on the experiences of the people actually experiencing it, and not on our own desires and inclinations.\n\n&gt;The same way that being infertile is still a negative medical issue, even if the woman who is infertile doesn't want kids at the moment. \n\nWell, *should* it be a negative medical issue? We consider it so only because our society (and almost every society, for that matter) values childbirth and raising children, and we consider it a harm to someone to be unable to have children of their own. Since this is generally true, we agree that this is harmful, and this should be considered a medical issue.\n\nBut take, for example, the case of vitamin C production. Namely, that most people can't do it. This could be considered a dysfunction- this was a fairly recent mutation that occurred because we generally don't to synthesize vitamin C for survival. But there's no social norm attached to this, and no reason it should bother us, despite the fact that we could call it a dysfunction."}, {"id": "cmil7ck", "body": "&gt;Being aromantic is more like not enjoying any form of media.

But I have not heard a description of aromantic that does not make me feel like those people need help. \n\nFrom my perspective, romantic attraction is just a natural extension of normal love, like the love you have for your friends or family. To fall in love means to trust and care about someone else even more than you do about your friends, enough to want to spend your life with them and dedicate a significant amount of your time and resources to their happiness and your mutual happiness. I think love is very important to being mentally and emotionally healthy. I don't think you can be emotionally healthy if you don't have any friends, if you shun people and never express love. So when people say that they are physically incapable of loving and trusting someone enough to enter a romantic relationship, I feel like something has to have gone wrong. \n\nSexuality is one thing. Sexuality is about physical response and physical acts, it is who turns you on and who you want to have sex with. Bodies are weird things, physical reactions can range into bizarre in most situations (I mean, consider allergies) and the actions people take are their own business (again, so long as nobody's getting hurt). But romantic feelings are based in emotion and thought and when something is very different with emotion and thought, when you are *lacking something* that most people have that has to do with emotion and thought, we call it a mental disorder. People who are lacking the ability to properly control their motivation and attention have ADHD. People who are lacking the ability to feel alright most of the time have Depression or Bipolar disorder. People who are lacking the ability to distinguish reality are schizophrenic or have delusions.

Love for your mom, for your grandma, for your aunt, for your best friend, for inanimate things. And I think romantic love is kind of the epitome of it, something to strive for. It's one thing to not be in love or not be looking for love, but to say you're actually just totally incapable of it? I call that mental illness.\n\nChange my view?\n\n**EDIT: Thank you, /u/nikoberg.

Aromatics are as varied as any group, and I can also easily see how what you say applies to some aromantics, but to say it applies to all is not just too simple, but simply untrue.\n\nOkay. Thank you for responding. I have a few questions for you:\n\n1. What is your definition of a \"romantic relationship\" and how does it differ from being best friends with someone?\n\n2. This is \"Change My View\", not \"Tell Me I'm Wrong Without Explaining Further\". If you're going to say something like \"I don't think anything you've said relates to me...I can see how what you say applies to some aromantics, but to say it applies to all is...simply untrue\", could you please at the very least specify which part of my arguments you're talking about and why you would say they aren't true?"}, {"id": "cmil26r", "body": "1.

Basically I am sexually attracted to people I think are attractive, which for some reason has a link to  how smart the woman is. But anyways, I'm here to explain what it's like going in my head surrounding romance.\n\nI have had two girlfriends, both of which I had a difficult time functioning. I get awkward, anxious, distant, serious, and generally dense when I was around them. And I started to feel bad about the relationships, and eventually I got very scared that I was going to get hurt, and it fueled a paranoia, which in relationship #1 was reasonable. After I broke it off with her I found out she was planning to end the relationship for a while. This was all around the time I'd just healed from a traumatic injury that had me off of my leg for almost a year of hell. And as soon as I was freed from the horrible trapped feeling, I noticed I still felt trapped. I went to a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. The point of all that is, come girlfriend #2, she was basically perfect. In my anxiety I was a mess. She couldn't understand it, and it made me not enjoy the times I was having with her. I knew I would've felt guilty if I broke up with her, but as my anxiety worsened I couldn't even handle talking to her without shaking all over, feeling scared, and crying. I eventually broke up with her, and I felt liberated. Free. I also felt like selfish scum for feeling so happy after I broke up with her. Ever since, I've noticed women I like, but a conflict would go on in my head. It's much a grey area- a gap between aromamtic and romantic. I can't decide. Thinking back I can remember that making out with girls seemed wrong. I had no reason to feel this way. I'm stuck somewhere in between wanting a girlfriend and denial of all romantic feelings. I don't even know if my feelings on this are controlled well enough.. I just can't decide which is better\n\nAs for the question, I think that aromantic persons literally just do not see the value in dating, and I'd extend this to asexuality.

In order to eat healthy and not fall into the fast food poverty cyclical trap, people need to: be paid a living wage that allows them to afford nutritious foods, be given enough time in their days to be able to shop for, prepare and cook the nutritious foods, be educated on how to prepare and cook nutritious foods and educated on what nutritious food even is, and be exposed to cooking nutritious foods as a routine from a young age (from their parents). \n\nThere is *a lot* of stuff that needs to be corrected about our society and the Big Food industry in order to stop the obesity epidemic in the U.S., and *none* of that has to do with shaming overweight people or telling them that they're unhealthy. They *know* they're unhealthy; what they don't know is how to become healthy. Telling them that they're unhealthy does nothing. It is not the solution. \n\nWe see post after post on here saying we should stop \"glorifying\" obesity, which just means we should not *not* shame obese people and the OPs think doing that is \"glorifying\" obesity, and all the posts seem to have this \"holier than thou\" air to them as if the OP thinks that if we all just stopped being nice and accepting to fat people that obesity would go away. As if our acceptance of people having overweight bodies is what *causes* them to continue to be overweight and not get healthier? Please. It's a huge wide-scale problem in society pertaining to food education, food affordability and availability, and lack of personal time for working class folks.

It's both their biggest strength and biggest flaw. The ubiquity of the 'standard' controller layout (D-pad, two analog sticks, and 4 buttons in a diamond) means that game developers have 20 or 30 years of collective knowledge of how design games with that form factor in mind. If the wiimote/nunchuck were as ubiquitous we would have many more game ideas that worked with those controllers. Instead what we get is developers trying to make games that use older controller styles because that's what they're used to. Even Nintendo is guilty of it - many of their biggest franchises used the same mechanics as before even though they are not as well suited to the controller (see Mario Galaxy and Brawl for example). That doesn't mean the controller is bad; it means that for those controllers to really succeed we need to have a period of experimentation and refinement. But to do that costs money and time. Games need to be released that try new ideas, and those are risks that many businesses would rather not take. It also means that developers can't just port their existing games to the console and expect it to work like they can for the Playstation and XBox.\n\nSo yeah, the problem isn't the controller themselves, its the historical context they exist in.

They are a **toy company.** If you look at material regarding their manifesto they mention this quite frequently. In reality, the reason that so many first party titles do so well for Nintendo, is that in typical Japanese fashion, they develop for the Japanese audience first and everyone else second. That being said, since it's advent Nintendo in typical toy market fashion released a \"paired toy\" or a toy that compliments other products from it's product line. We see this in stuff like Transformers, He-man, Skylanders, ect. \n\n&gt;&gt; The third-party support for Nintendo is shit. \n\nBack in the 90s, release options for game devs were severely limited. Before PSX/N64 Nintendo had the Lion's share of the market with Sega trailing in the number 2 spot. Then suddenly Sony jumps in and gives a third option, and finally Microsoft joins the console wars in 2000 with Xbox. That being said, developers primarily had to develop for Nintendo consoles to see their game get off the ground. Remember, back in the day there wasn't a method to the madness, if you made a title that wasn't console exclusive, it wasn't about matching the parameters, that was too complex an idea at the time. You had to make **a whole new game.** See:Campcom's disney titles and how drasticly different they are between consoles.\n\nOk so fast forward to today. Nintendo, is staying consistant with it's agenda. It's making toys as a toy company, and if you judge it on that basis it's doing a fantastic job. Nintendo isn't vying for third party competition. They don't want it. If a dev makes a Wii/Wiiu game, the ball is in Nintendo's court on that issue, but they know that their brands  are so strong they don't need third party support.\n\n\n\nTl;dr: You're making a category mistake of what Nintendo's goals are under the premise that they are a video game company.

This is called having a business plan and sticking to it.\n\nPost N64 they really started to cater to that market.  They knew that countless parents were calling any, and every, video game system out there \"a nintendo\".  They were going to the store to pick up a nintendo for little billy.  They focused on family fun and big multiplayer, and for good reason.\n\nSony and Microsoft went after the 'hardcore' crowd...hard.  Blood? Gore? Sex? Violence? We got it @ Sony and Microsoft! And look at their gaming divisions, both are generally considered pretty weak children of their parent companies.  Playstation and Xbox have both largely been big money loser hardware for their companies, and it's not like Sony or Microsoft have pushed out any really compelling first party titles.\n\nBut Sony is also an electronics, film, camera, semi-conductor, movie, telecom congolomarate.  They can afford to have a hardware loser and shitty titles and make it up in other ways.  Same with Microsoft. \n\nThey can hemorrhage money out of every single orifice in these divisions because they can still churn a profit through licensing and market share.\n\nNintendo? Nintendo makes Nintendo.  They can't build a $1000 console and sell it for $400 and try to recoup the costs in licensing.  They can't sink millions in R&amp;D to design a new processor chip.  Nintendo needs to make money on it's consoles, and it needs to make money selling games.  It has absolutely nothing to do with their controllers, and everything with staying in business.  They have, arguably, the strongest video game IP in on the market between Mario, Donkey Kong, and Zelda.\n\nKnow what happens when they try to make a clone of the PS4/XB1? They go the way of Sega, lose hardware all together, and are relegated to a minor, semi-decent software house.\n\nChildren LOVE Wii and Wii U controllers.  It's perfect for them.  The games are decidedly designed for gamers under the age of 12, and for families on a budget.  That's their whole market and business model.\n\nWithout that differentiation, without the absolute best motion controller, or the unique Wii U? What have they got? They don't have shit is the answer."}, {"id": "2nzh1p", "body": "I would consider myself a Nintendo fan. In my opinion, Nintendo has historically had, by far, the best first-party games of any console. Mario, Zelda, DK etc. will be the series that will forever be tied to society's perception of what a game is. I also believe that the N64 was, when compared to the standards of its day, the best console ever made. That said, they have dwindled to a niche company that is pretty much limited to selling to gamers under the age of 12, and adults who are willing to buy an entire console just to play Smash and Mario Kart with their friends while high (I am one of those people so I don't judge). I have a PS4 too, and would say I spend at least 75% of my gaming time, and well over 90% of my gaming budget on games for it despite adoring all things Nintendo. The reason for this is simple. The third-party support for Nintendo is shit. It's nearly impossible to find a decent game for the Wii or Wii U that isn't first party. And the reason for this is obvious. The wacky controllers. Aside from a limited number of applications that get old real fast, these controllers are awful. How are devs supposed to make a good game for them? Even when playing first party games that are optimized for them and that are stellar in quality, like Twilight Princess and Super Mario Galaxy, I find myself wishing I had a normal style controller in my hands. IMO Nintendo could have created a console that was, in essence, a clone of the PS4/XB1 and been way more successful. Third party devs would make all their games available for it, rather than shit-quality ports that come out much later (ie Watch Dogs). This would, in turn, encourage way more people to buy the console and, more importantly, games for it. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Plenty of people hate their fucking jobs and get treated like shit and get paid a lot less than porn. Also, I'm pretty sure people don't die filming porn. If adults can choose to enlist in the fucking army why can they not choose to get fucked on camera?"}, {"id": "2nz84m", "body": "I've arrived to this conclusion as a result of the experiences and environment of having lived in two extremely contrasting locations: Las Vegas, NV(Sin City), and Atlanta, GA(Right in the middle of the bible belt, also a place where people are extremely passionate about college football). After having engaged in numerous debates with people on this issue, I've heard countless reasons why people think porn is wrong or immoral. I will just go over three main ones and explain why college football is much worse.\n\n1) Porn is wrong because it monetizes someone's body in a way that compromises their health and integrity.\n\nThe hypocrisy in this statement is astounding, coming from anyone who is involved in college football. So having sex in front of a camera jeopardizes someone's health and integrity. But having 250lb men who can run like track stars repeatedly bashing into each others' heads as hard as they can doesn't? \n\n2) Porn sets an unrealistic expectations of body image for young girls.\n\nWhat is more of an unreasonable expectation? For a girl to be maybe slightly more attractive than average(with all the fetishes in porn these days, there is an ever broadening acceptance of body types). Or for a boy to be 6'4\", 250lbs, 5% body fat, able to bench 400 lbs, and run a 4.4 40? \n\n3) Porn is wrong because people are selling their bodies.\n\nOn a certain level, isn't everyone selling their body? Even the most basic and mundane of office jobs require you to use your fingers to type. I imagine a lot of folks will not want to get into a debate on that deep of a subjective topic though, so I will just stick to comparing it to college football. AT LEAST they're actually selling their body and getting compensated for it. Better than constantly engaging in brutal physical contact, risking serious injury and even death in some cases; not even receiving a dime. All this while the schools and owners of the NCAA make millions upon millions as a result of your hard labor and suffering. The free education argument doesn't fly either. Everyone knows that barely half of students who went to college focused on academics are able to find a job upon graduation. Let alone \"student-athletes\", who everyone knows takes filler classes in pointless majors; has other students on campus do their homework so they may remain academically eligible. \n\nCMV\n\nEDIT: A few common arguments that keep popping up so I will just address them here so I don't have to copy and paste over and over. \n\n#1) STDs are rampant in the porn industry\n\nPorn stars are actually 80% LESS likely to get an STD than a member of the general public of the same age.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1cu016/til_professional_porn_actors_are_80_percent_less/\nI wonder how much less likely they'd be to get one than say, the popular captain of the football team?\n\n#2) Football provides an avenue for future career opportunities that porn does not.\nhttp://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/dan-marino-vince-young-broke-nfl-players-lost-fortunes/\nIf this is true, why are 78% of NFL players going broke within two years of retirement? If these colleges are doing such a good job teaching football players valuable life and career lessons. Why is it that even the most gifted, the top 1% who make the NFL, can't apply those valuable lessons 2 years removed from the end of their careers?\n\n#3) Another common argument I've seen is this: \"Porn doesn't make their workers any happier or healthier. Football does through encouraging exercise and teaching life lessons.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PepuR7rxSw\nHere is an interview which is backed by a study that shows porn stars are happier, healthier, more likely to be content with their body, and less likely to have an STD than the average woman. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmi8u53", "body": "Am I missing something - you've described how both industries are objectively similar, not how football is \"worse\""}, {"id": "cmi8u53", "body": "Am I missing something - you've described how both industries are objectively similar, not how football is \"worse\""}, {"id": "cmi93d1", "body": "I think I have. \n1) Getting repeatedly hit in the head hundreds if not thousands of times is certainly worse for your health than having sex.\n2) It's much easier to fit into one of the many fetish categories of porn, than to be able to run a 4.4, bench 400lbs, have 5% body fat, etc.\n3) Selling your body is better than giving away your body for free."}, {"id": "cmi93d1", "body": "I think I have. \n1) Getting repeatedly hit in the head hundreds if not thousands of times is certainly worse for your health than having sex.\n2) It's much easier to fit into one of the many fetish categories of porn, than to be able to run a 4.4, bench 400lbs, have 5% body fat, etc.\n3) Selling your body is better than giving away your body for free."}, {"id": "cmih6pi", "body": "No football player ever has had anywhere near 5% body fat.

After having engaged in numerous debates with people on this issue, I've heard countless reasons why people think porn is wrong or immoral. I will just go over three main ones and explain why college football is much worse.\n\n1) Porn is wrong because it monetizes someone's body in a way that compromises their health and integrity.\n\nThe hypocrisy in this statement is astounding, coming from anyone who is involved in college football. So having sex in front of a camera jeopardizes someone's health and integrity. But having 250lb men who can run like track stars repeatedly bashing into each others' heads as hard as they can doesn't? \n\n2) Porn sets an unrealistic expectations of body image for young girls.\n\nWhat is more of an unreasonable expectation? For a girl to be maybe slightly more attractive than average(with all the fetishes in porn these days, there is an ever broadening acceptance of body types). Or for a boy to be 6'4\", 250lbs, 5% body fat, able to bench 400 lbs, and run a 4.4 40? \n\n3) Porn is wrong because people are selling their bodies.\n\nOn a certain level, isn't everyone selling their body? Even the most basic and mundane of office jobs require you to use your fingers to type. I imagine a lot of folks will not want to get into a debate on that deep of a subjective topic though, so I will just stick to comparing it to college football. AT LEAST they're actually selling their body and getting compensated for it. Better than constantly engaging in brutal physical contact, risking serious injury and even death in some cases; not even receiving a dime. All this while the schools and owners of the NCAA make millions upon millions as a result of your hard labor and suffering. The free education argument doesn't fly either. Everyone knows that barely half of students who went to college focused on academics are able to find a job upon graduation. Let alone \"student-athletes\", who everyone knows takes filler classes in pointless majors; has other students on campus do their homework so they may remain academically eligible. \n\nCMV\n\nEDIT: A few common arguments that keep popping up so I will just address them here so I don't have to copy and paste over and over. \n\n#1) STDs are rampant in the porn industry\n\nPorn stars are actually 80% LESS likely to get an STD than a member of the general public of the same age.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1cu016/til_professional_porn_actors_are_80_percent_less/\nI wonder how much less likely they'd be to get one than say, the popular captain of the football team?\n\n#2) Football provides an avenue for future career opportunities that porn does not.\nhttp://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/dan-marino-vince-young-broke-nfl-players-lost-fortunes/\nIf this is true, why are 78% of NFL players going broke within two years of retirement? If these colleges are doing such a good job teaching football players valuable life and career lessons. Why is it that even the most gifted, the top 1% who make the NFL, can't apply those valuable lessons 2 years removed from the end of their careers?\n\n#3) Another common argument I've seen is this: \"Porn doesn't make their workers any happier or healthier. Football does through encouraging exercise and teaching life lessons.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PepuR7rxSw\nHere is an interview which is backed by a study that shows porn stars are happier, healthier, more likely to be content with their body, and less likely to have an STD than the average woman. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmikvj3", "body": "Everyone seems to be splitting hairs rather than going for the intuitive answer so I'd like to give this a try.

I will just go over three main ones and explain why college football is much worse.\n\n1) Porn is wrong because it monetizes someone's body in a way that compromises their health and integrity.\n\nThe hypocrisy in this statement is astounding, coming from anyone who is involved in college football. So having sex in front of a camera jeopardizes someone's health and integrity. But having 250lb men who can run like track stars repeatedly bashing into each others' heads as hard as they can doesn't? \n\n2) Porn sets an unrealistic expectations of body image for young girls.\n\nWhat is more of an unreasonable expectation? For a girl to be maybe slightly more attractive than average(with all the fetishes in porn these days, there is an ever broadening acceptance of body types). Or for a boy to be 6'4\", 250lbs, 5% body fat, able to bench 400 lbs, and run a 4.4 40? \n\n3) Porn is wrong because people are selling their bodies.\n\nOn a certain level, isn't everyone selling their body? Even the most basic and mundane of office jobs require you to use your fingers to type. I imagine a lot of folks will not want to get into a debate on that deep of a subjective topic though, so I will just stick to comparing it to college football. AT LEAST they're actually selling their body and getting compensated for it. Better than constantly engaging in brutal physical contact, risking serious injury and even death in some cases; not even receiving a dime. All this while the schools and owners of the NCAA make millions upon millions as a result of your hard labor and suffering. The free education argument doesn't fly either. Everyone knows that barely half of students who went to college focused on academics are able to find a job upon graduation. Let alone \"student-athletes\", who everyone knows takes filler classes in pointless majors; has other students on campus do their homework so they may remain academically eligible. \n\nCMV\n\nEDIT: A few common arguments that keep popping up so I will just address them here so I don't have to copy and paste over and over. \n\n#1) STDs are rampant in the porn industry\n\nPorn stars are actually 80% LESS likely to get an STD than a member of the general public of the same age.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1cu016/til_professional_porn_actors_are_80_percent_less/\nI wonder how much less likely they'd be to get one than say, the popular captain of the football team?\n\n#2) Football provides an avenue for future career opportunities that porn does not.\nhttp://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/dan-marino-vince-young-broke-nfl-players-lost-fortunes/\nIf this is true, why are 78% of NFL players going broke within two years of retirement? If these colleges are doing such a good job teaching football players valuable life and career lessons. Why is it that even the most gifted, the top 1% who make the NFL, can't apply those valuable lessons 2 years removed from the end of their careers?\n\n#3) Another common argument I've seen is this: \"Porn doesn't make their workers any happier or healthier. Football does through encouraging exercise and teaching life lessons.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PepuR7rxSw\nHere is an interview which is backed by a study that shows porn stars are happier, healthier, more likely to be content with their body, and less likely to have an STD than the average woman. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmibs9f", "body": "&gt; The free education argument doesn't fly either.

While the job market for grads in the last 5 years has been very difficult, and might have a nationwide placement rate of &lt; 50%, I doubt that is true over the long term.  It wouldn't be fair to use this argument based on an outlier set of years.  Second, it's not clear that student athletes who graduate have a worse job-placement rate.  My guess would be that it would be higher, as success as a member of a sports team is a quality highly prized by employers.  As a manager looking at two people with the same degree, the person who also played sports for 3-5 years would have an edge.

Everyone knows that barely half of students who went to college focused on academics are able to find a job upon graduation. Let alone \"student-athletes\", who everyone knows takes filler classes in pointless majors; has other students on campus do their homework so they may remain academically eligible. \n\nI don't think you understand the demographics of student athletes. There are over 400,000 student athletes in the USA, and most of them are well aware of the fact that after college they will not be a professional athlete. In football for instance, [less than 2% of college football players turn pro](http://www.businessinsider.com/odds-college-athletes-become-professionals-2012-2?op=1), the rest end up doing something else. Of that other 98%, maybe 5% had a legitimate shot of making it and might have a hard time coming to grips with not making the NFL, but a lot of those guys, especially ones not playing at the big schools, know that playing football well is their ticket to an affordable education and some good times playing a game they love. \n\nSecond, just because these people play sports doesn't mean they are immediately dumb either. You only hear about the guys taking filler classes and dumb majors because they are the ones ESPN talks about when discussing first round draft picks in the coming NFL draft.\n\nFurther, I'd argue that being a successful college athlete should bode well later in life if you can find another passion to fill the hole that is left by sports when you graduate. They've already shown the drive and the passion necessary to excel at something in life, meaning they have the capacity to repeat that doing something else.\n\nLastly, there is nothing inherently wrong with pornographic performers or college football players. Most of the players, as I mentioned above, know they aren't going to make the NFL. However, they know they need a post-secondary education and if they can play football, a game they love, while getting their education cheaper than normal or free, why would someone pass that up. I would have jumped all over an athletic scholarship in hockey if it meant I could have got my degree for free while playing the game I love. \n\nAs for pornographic performers, they are just using their looks and features they were born with to make an honest living. It's a fairly safe and regulated industry these days as far as I can tell.\n\nNow, that all being said, I do have an issue with how much money the NCAA, a non-profit organization, makes from college football, but that was just a tiny part of your argument. The NCAA is corrupt, and while not as bad as FIFA, a non-profit shouldn't be bringing in the big bucks."}, {"id": "2nz84m", "body": "I've arrived to this conclusion as a result of the experiences and environment of having lived in two extremely contrasting locations: Las Vegas, NV(Sin City), and Atlanta, GA(Right in the middle of the bible belt, also a place where people are extremely passionate about college football).

When was the last time a 20 year old female had the brain of an 80 year old as a result of being hit in the head over and over from porn?

Football does through encouraging exercise and teaching life lessons.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PepuR7rxSw\nHere is an interview which is backed by a study that shows porn stars are happier, healthier, more likely to be content with their body, and less likely to have an STD than the average woman. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmiqq1q", "body": "I also dislike college football, but for different reasons that I think are more valid. So while I agree with your view, I think that it's the wrong reason.\n\nFirst, in terms of monetizing someone's body in a way that compromises health. You have to understand that most players in college will not suffer career-ending injuries. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that a majority won't even have an injury with a serious long-term effect. And some will never be injured. That's the way it is with all sports. The fitness you would gain from being an average (or even below average) football player on a SEC football team will serve you well long-term. I can't say the same for the fitness you would gain from constantly having sex.\n\nSecond, although you can argue that porn doesn't create unrealistic expectations for body image, you definitely have to quantify it. Honestly, I think that it doesn't because people realize that no matter what their situation (Except guys with small dicks, and even then there's probably a market somewhere) there's a place for them somewhere in porn. The most unrealistic expectations that come from porn, I think, are just how sex works in general. But to the point of college football. Almost everyone knows that you have to be GOOD to play football in the SEC. And you have to be well above average in high school to play football in college anywhere. Your example of \"a boy to be 6'4\", 250lbs, 5% body fat, able to bench 400 lbs, and run a 4.4 40?\" also is limited to certain positions. A running back that size would be at a disadvantage to a wide receiver at that size. They'd be too big. Likewise, they'd be at a disadvantage to a lineman. They'd be too small. Different positions require different physiques. A good running back might be 5'10 and 210 lbs. A good defensive tackle might be 6'6 and 305. Both people in those positions, even at a high level, will likely be above a 5% body fat.\n\nThird, Porn is wrong because people are selling their bodies. Your counter to this is weak, quite honestly. A job like most people have require certain skills, and they require training. You cannot just walk in to an office, and get paid. You have to have education and training if you want to make a career out of it. Same thing for football. You can't just walk on to an NFL team and say \"Here's my body\" You're selling more than just your body. You're selling your education, experience, and training. In porn, you literally just need a body. Having certain attributes help, but you don't need anything more. And while you're right about the NCAA football players not getting paid, a lot of them aren't playing for money. They're playing because they love football. They know they're probably not going to make the NFL, but once you get the taste of competitive sports like that, you want to be involved as long as possible.\n\n\nLike I said, I don't disagree that college football is worse, but the part of your view that needs to be changed is the WHY. And it's the same reason you should hate the olympics. The athletes, AKA the ones providing the entertainment, are not being paid at all. The coaches make millions, the networks make millions, if not billions, and in both the NCAA and the IOC, they won't hesitate to kick the athletes to the curb if they break any of the rules about \"integrity\" while both organizations are notoriously greedy and corrupt.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmiqq1q", "body": "I also dislike college football, but for different reasons that I think are more valid.

And no, I am not getting porn and prostitution confused. I have worked in, and worked with many people who work/have worked in, porn. It is not the safe, professional environment you suggest.

After having engaged in numerous debates with people on this issue, I've heard countless reasons why people think porn is wrong or immoral. I will just go over three main ones and explain why college football is much worse.\n\n1) Porn is wrong because it monetizes someone's body in a way that compromises their health and integrity.\n\nThe hypocrisy in this statement is astounding, coming from anyone who is involved in college football. So having sex in front of a camera jeopardizes someone's health and integrity. But having 250lb men who can run like track stars repeatedly bashing into each others' heads as hard as they can doesn't? \n\n2) Porn sets an unrealistic expectations of body image for young girls.\n\nWhat is more of an unreasonable expectation? For a girl to be maybe slightly more attractive than average(with all the fetishes in porn these days, there is an ever broadening acceptance of body types). Or for a boy to be 6'4\", 250lbs, 5% body fat, able to bench 400 lbs, and run a 4.4 40? \n\n3) Porn is wrong because people are selling their bodies.\n\nOn a certain level, isn't everyone selling their body? Even the most basic and mundane of office jobs require you to use your fingers to type. I imagine a lot of folks will not want to get into a debate on that deep of a subjective topic though, so I will just stick to comparing it to college football. AT LEAST they're actually selling their body and getting compensated for it. Better than constantly engaging in brutal physical contact, risking serious injury and even death in some cases; not even receiving a dime. All this while the schools and owners of the NCAA make millions upon millions as a result of your hard labor and suffering. The free education argument doesn't fly either. Everyone knows that barely half of students who went to college focused on academics are able to find a job upon graduation. Let alone \"student-athletes\", who everyone knows takes filler classes in pointless majors; has other students on campus do their homework so they may remain academically eligible. \n\nCMV\n\nEDIT: A few common arguments that keep popping up so I will just address them here so I don't have to copy and paste over and over. \n\n#1) STDs are rampant in the porn industry\n\nPorn stars are actually 80% LESS likely to get an STD than a member of the general public of the same age.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1cu016/til_professional_porn_actors_are_80_percent_less/\nI wonder how much less likely they'd be to get one than say, the popular captain of the football team?\n\n#2) Football provides an avenue for future career opportunities that porn does not.\nhttp://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/dan-marino-vince-young-broke-nfl-players-lost-fortunes/\nIf this is true, why are 78% of NFL players going broke within two years of retirement? If these colleges are doing such a good job teaching football players valuable life and career lessons. Why is it that even the most gifted, the top 1% who make the NFL, can't apply those valuable lessons 2 years removed from the end of their careers?\n\n#3) Another common argument I've seen is this: \"Porn doesn't make their workers any happier or healthier.

Football, fundamentally, is a game (though I'm not denying the college football is highly lucrative). You generally only play games because you like to (unless of course you're directly pursuing the NFL) and for no other reason, while businesses are different. I'm not denying that many (more likely *most*) porn stars enjoy what they do and do porn because they want to do porn instead of other things, but at the end of the day most of them probably wouldn't do the things they do if they don't get paid for it. College football players, barring special cases (like corruption or actually pursuing the NFL) do it for free every day.

The vast majority of CFB players wont make the NFL and they know it. But theyre going to college for free so they can take advantage of it. Many of those kids are also in colleges they could never have gotten into otherwise so they are getting a better education than they could have hoped for. Sure, a lot are lazy and stupid and fail to graduate. Theyre still better off then than where they would be without football. They still had an opportunity to get ahead in life. Whether they take it is up to them. \n\n2) it actually really helps with job prospects. Not only are alumni more willing to hire someone who was on sports teams (especially at big sports schools), employers like atheletes in general. they are assumed to show dedication and teamwork by simply being on the team. Employers like this and are sometimes willing to overlook a lower GPA because of it. \n\n3) I believe that porn actually does lead to distorted images of females and sex. Porn is how most guys learn about sex now. That means that a lot of guys may expect sex to be like porn if they havent actually had sex yet. This can of course lead to unreal standards as they are used to seeing porn stars who have unreal bodies and sex abilities (its their job after all). example, anal IRL and anal in porn are two completely different things. Football doesnt really set any expectations for anyone, except other football players. \n\n\n\n4) your wealth argument is unimportant. Who cares if they are broke after retiring? thats their own fault. there are also tons of NFL people who are doing just fine. Im sure there are porn stars who are also broke and others who are doing fine too. obviously porn stars make a lot less money though.

Sexual diseases are rampant, as sex education and safe sex practices are not widespread. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that many scenes (in both gay and straight porn) are required to be performed bareback (without condoms) and hence the rate of transmission of STDs and the rate of unwanted pregnancies is quite high. Porn stars are also often required to go outside their comfort zone and perform acts they would not otherwise contemplate in order to gain employment. I read an interview with Stoya, a popular pornstar, in which she stated that once of her very first jobs was a lesbian shoot announced at the last minute. She was perfectly comfortable with it, but more vanilla performers may have trouble finding work. It's not like pornstars are highly paid either - they get by, but not like the pay of a professional athlete. It also carries a stigma that can make it harder to pornstars to find further employment and can lead to bullying and abuse. Also, though many pornstars are consenting adults, sex trafficking and illegal prostitution still do occur, as well as child pornography. These illegal acts are often well hidden in the porn industry. Finally, porn is not a lifetime job - unlike college athletes becoming professional athletes, pornstars have nowhere to go, and unless they are very successful will have the same troubles finding work as they age as athletes do, but without the massive financial benefits associated with professional sport that allows early retirement. There are also no jobs for them to move on to - retired athletes can become coaches or commentators, for example. Retired pornstars have no obvious avenue of employment."}, {"id": "cmilton", "body": "The porn industry actually has a lot of flaws.

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that many scenes (in both gay and straight porn) are required to be performed bareback (without condoms) and hence the rate of transmission of STDs and the rate of unwanted pregnancies is quite high. Porn stars are also often required to go outside their comfort zone and perform acts they would not otherwise contemplate in order to gain employment. I read an interview with Stoya, a popular pornstar, in which she stated that once of her very first jobs was a lesbian shoot announced at the last minute. She was perfectly comfortable with it, but more vanilla performers may have trouble finding work. It's not like pornstars are highly paid either - they get by, but not like the pay of a professional athlete. It also carries a stigma that can make it harder to pornstars to find further employment and can lead to bullying and abuse. Also, though many pornstars are consenting adults, sex trafficking and illegal prostitution still do occur, as well as child pornography. These illegal acts are often well hidden in the porn industry. Finally, porn is not a lifetime job - unlike college athletes becoming professional athletes, pornstars have nowhere to go, and unless they are very successful will have the same troubles finding work as they age as athletes do, but without the massive financial benefits associated with professional sport that allows early retirement. There are also no jobs for them to move on to - retired athletes can become coaches or commentators, for example. Retired pornstars have no obvious avenue of employment."}, {"id": "cmimxmv", "body": "See #1 and #2"}, {"id": "2nz84m", "body": "I've arrived to this conclusion as a result of the experiences and environment of having lived in two extremely contrasting locations: Las Vegas, NV(Sin City), and Atlanta, GA(Right in the middle of the bible belt, also a place where people are extremely passionate about college football). After having engaged in numerous debates with people on this issue, I've heard countless reasons why people think porn is wrong or immoral. I will just go over three main ones and explain why college football is much worse.\n\n1) Porn is wrong because it monetizes someone's body in a way that compromises their health and integrity.\n\nThe hypocrisy in this statement is astounding, coming from anyone who is involved in college football. So having sex in front of a camera jeopardizes someone's health and integrity. But having 250lb men who can run like track stars repeatedly bashing into each others' heads as hard as they can doesn't? \n\n2) Porn sets an unrealistic expectations of body image for young girls.\n\nWhat is more of an unreasonable expectation? For a girl to be maybe slightly more attractive than average(with all the fetishes in porn these days, there is an ever broadening acceptance of body types). Or for a boy to be 6'4\", 250lbs, 5% body fat, able to bench 400 lbs, and run a 4.4 40? \n\n3) Porn is wrong because people are selling their bodies.\n\nOn a certain level, isn't everyone selling their body? Even the most basic and mundane of office jobs require you to use your fingers to type. I imagine a lot of folks will not want to get into a debate on that deep of a subjective topic though, so I will just stick to comparing it to college football. AT LEAST they're actually selling their body and getting compensated for it. Better than constantly engaging in brutal physical contact, risking serious injury and even death in some cases; not even receiving a dime. All this while the schools and owners of the NCAA make millions upon millions as a result of your hard labor and suffering. The free education argument doesn't fly either. Everyone knows that barely half of students who went to college focused on academics are able to find a job upon graduation. Let alone \"student-athletes\", who everyone knows takes filler classes in pointless majors; has other students on campus do their homework so they may remain academically eligible. \n\nCMV\n\nEDIT: A few common arguments that keep popping up so I will just address them here so I don't have to copy and paste over and over. \n\n#1) STDs are rampant in the porn industry\n\nPorn stars are actually 80% LESS likely to get an STD than a member of the general public of the same age.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1cu016/til_professional_porn_actors_are_80_percent_less/\nI wonder how much less likely they'd be to get one than say, the popular captain of the football team?\n\n#2) Football provides an avenue for future career opportunities that porn does not.\nhttp://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/dan-marino-vince-young-broke-nfl-players-lost-fortunes/\nIf this is true, why are 78% of NFL players going broke within two years of retirement? If these colleges are doing such a good job teaching football players valuable life and career lessons. Why is it that even the most gifted, the top 1% who make the NFL, can't apply those valuable lessons 2 years removed from the end of their careers?\n\n#3) Another common argument I've seen is this: \"Porn doesn't make their workers any happier or healthier. Football does through encouraging exercise and teaching life lessons.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PepuR7rxSw\nHere is an interview which is backed by a study that shows porn stars are happier, healthier, more likely to be content with their body, and less likely to have an STD than the average woman. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmircw5", "body": "I don't believe you can exploit someone unless they are somehow being coerced or forced to do some thing. \n\nPornstars and college athletes are not faced with a choice of life or death when it comes to their professions.

Worse than that, all of this is going to happen in my lifetime. \n\nIf I had a child now, I would be bringing someone into the world who is utterly and completely irresponsible for how much damage their ancestors did to this planet, and yet will bear the most terrible cost.

Yes, the climate is very much warming up, and yes, it's going to become more and more difficult to adapt, but humanity finds a way.  The average temperature of the planet will rise several degrees.  Sea levels will rise.  Some places will be inundated, but humanity will survive it.  \n\nClimate change will not kill people.  It will make it more difficult for them to thrive, but most societies are already living well beyond what's necessary to stay alive.  If resources become scarce, then societies will scale back before they simply start dying.\n\nAnd, yes, this sounds a little self-centered, but if you're able to read the IPCC report, then you live in a place that's going to do okay in a new climate.  You live in a place with the resources to adapt.  Changes to infrastructure can help to mitigate the effects of anything you're going to see over the next few generations.  Rising sea levels can be dealt with by building better water management systems or simply living somewhere inland (I live 200 miles from the coast, I honestly couldn't care less how much the sea level rises, because it isn't coming up here).  \n\nMost of the world outside of the polar regions will see more extreme weather more frequently, but it isn't something that will kill people en masse.  \n\nYes, life is going to require some changes, but you need not worry about the planet becoming uninhabitable within the next century.\n\nI realize that all that is pretty vague, but I'd be more than happy to address any specific concerns that you have."}, {"id": "cmizqje", "body": "&gt;Climate change will not kill people.\n\nClimate change has already killed people.
