No one has a problem with this, and it is recognized as a legal reason to kill somebody. Self defense or defense of others. Absolute defense to murder. It's not \"shady circumstances\" is my point.\n\nShady circumstances is when an armed person kills an unarmed person, and the only evidence that the unarmed person was being violent is the word of the killer, which there is reason to doubt but often not enough evidence to rebut. Shady circumstances is when someone besides a court decides someone should die for their earlier crimes, when they are not in the process of being violent. In movies we are OK with vigilantism because we see the bad guy commit the crime, we are 100% certain he raped or murdered, and because of the way the story is written we are sure he will do it again, thus we are comfortable with the hero gunning him down. That's not real life. We are neither certain the \"bad guy\" did the things we think, nor are we sure they will do it again. \n\nAlso there's a huge problem with your presumption that people are basically automatons; one thing on one track that will never change. Criminal is not a class of person that marks a person permanently.

A truckload of innocent babies could be considered expendable if that is literally the only way to save ten truckloads of innocent babies. It isn't much of a revelation that sometimes military assets are sacrificed in pursuit of a greater mission. However, the leadership of the military is supposed to take great care that lives and resources are never sacrificed needlessly or in vain. The US military, more than any other in history, has been willing to go to great lengths to preserve the lives of its servicemembers. The death of a US service member is *expensive* both in terms of actual resources that are expended as well as the political will that is lost when a service member dies.

You proved your point.\n\n1b. Why complain about Little Mac being old but not Duck Hunt or Pacman? Duck Hunt wasn't even a single character, let alone a playable one. What's wrong with reviving classics?\n\n2a. Lucina is different from Marth in that her hitboxes are bigger. She may not be as strong as Marth but it is easier to connect a strong hit with her. /u/Fri3dR1ce describes this much better and is more knowledgeable here: http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/2jng1d/lucina_vs_marth_misconceptions/\n\n2b. The sword wielding characters you mentioned all play very differently. Link/Toon Link have ranged abilities that aren't present in the others. Shulk has his own thing going on with his different modes and the play style for him is built around that. Marth and Ike may seem similar at first glance but have totally different movesets and things to concentrate on. If you aren't taking advantage of what these different characters have to offer and are just using them all the same, you are diminishing your opportunities for ASS KICKING.\n\n3a. Yes, Peach pulls out Toad as a B move. \n\n3b. Toad has no abilities. Even in his new game coming out, he just walks around and uses his environment to his advantage. At least the villager has different things relating to different tools and activities he uses/does. There is nothing to base a fight style nor move set off of."}, {"id": "2oygq8", "body": "Little Mac: Every character in the game has a balance between strength and recovery.

I'm not saying he's too strong or too weak, but certainly does not have an acceptable balance.\n\nAlso, he hasn't been a playable character in a video game since Gamecube, and hasn't had his own release since Gamecube. \n\nLucina: Just another Marth clone, slightly faster and slightly weaker. Certainly not deserving of a character slot in SSB4. There are also far too many sword wielding characters in the game, with all having essentially the same play style: Marth, Lucina, Shulk, Ike, Link, Toon Link. \n\nToad: Toad is finally getting his own feature game on the WiiU, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. Nintendo tends to put new characters in to the SSB series when they get their own feature game. Pit is an example of this. Toad has been a big part of the Mario series, and is very deserving of a spot in SSB. He is the only character from Mario Kart 64 that is not in SSB. \n\nThe only issue with Toad being a character is that Peach's neutral B pulls toad out but they could change this easily.\n\nConvince me that they haven't made mistakes with the roster in SSB4.

And especially with kids - having several kids definitely means that the absolute maximum amount of time and care that each kid can have from you is lowered. \n\nOf course all of this is pretty personal. For me if I love something (or someone), then I want to be able to commit a certain amount of my time and attention to it because being able to commit to people (and dogs and kids) that I love makes me happy and fulfilled. If I had a ton of time and a lot of attention to give, then I could potentially have more than one thing in that spot. But I don't have a ton of time and a lot of attention to spare, and I would feel that committing to multiple partners (or kids or pets or whatever) would not be fair of me to do right now. "}, {"id": "cmroawy", "body": "It depends on what you'd consider love, actually. For me, that's linked very much to commitment. Attraction I wouldn't limit to one person - if someone is my type and interesting and funny, then of course I'd be attracted to them. But 'love' in the sense of how I would personally experience it in a committed relationship is different. I would consider to be a shared experience, something that all partners in a relationship can have. It's a work in progress, built over a period of time with another person and includes a good deal of intimacy. How I'd love any one person is unique to them, but it *does* take effort to nurture.\n\nCould I potentially love several people at once? Absolutely, I don't see why that wouldn't be possible. \n\nDo I *want* to? No. \n\nBecause of the time and effort it takes to commit to someone, I would actually not be interested in adding another person to the mix. I understand how polyarmory works, I'd be fine if my partner felt they were able to, but I don't want to put in the effort to love anyone else as strongly as I would them because that would mean I have less resources to give to my current partner that I do really love and would bend over backward for. I don't want to be in a situation where two people that I love equally might both be asking me to bend, but in different directions. And let's face it, while your love might be potentially unlimited, your time, money, attention, affection and other similar factors might not be. \n\nIt's a real world limitation, mostly. Can some poly people make it work? Sure, but it's a level of effort involved to love and commit to more than one person that I don't know if most people can handle. I know *at this point in time in my life*, as a young adult, that I certainly couldn't. Maybe in future things might be different, but for the majority of people, with all the commitments that they're juggling, loving more than one person and committing to more than one partner is *difficult*. Kudos to those who can, but they're not the average person. \n\nSo what I'd say is that when people love and commit to each other, they generally (in most cases) expect a certain amount of effort to come with that. Logistically speaking adding more people means less total time to spend on each of them and way more interpersonal issues and problems to work out. \n\nIn short, it's not an issue of limiting love, but being limited in loving. I would prefer not to put myself in a situation where I was in love with more than one person because of that. Hopefully that makes sense!\n\n(Just to note, I'd have no problem with a partner who was poly or being one of the points in a V or something like that. Would be much less interested in a triad or being the centre of the V, though. How other people feel they can handle things is on them, but for me - and I think I can speak for most people here - it's a lot of pressure and a fuckton of work to love and be loved by more than one other person.)"}, {"id": "cmrtejx", "body": "\u2206, but not for what you might think.\n\nWhat I find most thought-provoking about what you wrote is the part about being asked to bend in two different ways.

My love for him is not an attachment to his presence, but a selfless desire to see him be happy.\n\nLove is not obsession. I think, when we obsess over another person, we have a need for them. That need, if unfulfilled, causes us pain and discomfort, which fuels our obsession. I think many people experience this when they first experience romantic love. When I first \"fell in love\" with my wife, I obsessed over her. I needed to be with her to be happy and to be away from her was pain. Ultimately, my obsession was selfish, not selfless, and therefore not love. Now, being married for the better part of a decade, I do truly love her even though I no longer obsess over her the way I did when we were younger.\n\nFor me, love is one thing: a driving desire to put the needs of another person before your own. That can be love for a romantic partner, a friend, or a family member. Love is always love.\n\nAnd so, since I view love defined in that way, I separate it from sexuality. I could have sex with someone and not love them just as I could have a deep love for a best friend and never engage with them sexually.\n\nSo, I think I would say that yes, we are all designed to love more than one person because, even if all you have are two parents and one friend, that is three people right there for you to love.

I used to think that it would be great if Wikipedia had small Google text ads on each page, a little something relevant that you might want to click on. And while it could really be profitable, it also leads to those who *seek* profits. Those who have no relationship to you except as a data point. \n\nAs I've become older and more aware (along with the Internet), I've been paying attention to web tracking, and where it happens. And one thing I've discovered is that there is a *shockingly large* amount of it. Google Analytics, for instance? It's on about 80% of webpages. That's an even distribution, nor bounded by category, meaning that Google (in return for telling statistics to webmasters) knows 80% of all webpages that you go to. Porn, news, social media, and *information*. It's a pretty complete picture of who you are and what you do. \n\nAnd it's not only Google. It's tens of companies, ones that you've never heard of before like Quantcast. All of them want as much information as they can get from you, to sell to whoever is the highest bidder that day. \n\nI say all of this because of the element of *trust* that other people are talking about in this thread.

It doesn't care if you look up things that are controversial, or dangerous, or embarrassing. But if it were open to ads, a lot of people would suddenly have access to that data.

You don't survive verbal abuse, because the damage can cause emotional scars and mental anguish, but is impossible for verbal abuse to result in a loss of life.  We don't even survive *depression*, something that for those who suffer from it, can make every waking minute an absolute hell. No, we say we *battle* depression (but if you should try to kill yourself and live, you would have certainly *survived* the suicide attempt). \n\nI think using 'survive' with rape is an attempt to communicate just how horrible and life-changing the experience can be. Also, being a survivor implies strength and perseverance. But in using the word where it isn't appropriate, you undignify victims of rape. \n\nChange my view."}, {"id": "cmulxjc", "body": "\"Survivor\" is appropriate because rape is absolutely life threatening.

While you claim lip service, the fact that there is a significant roadblock to passing bills shows that the difference between conservatives and liberals \"paying lip service\" is still a very real difference. Certainly, many Dems are not as liberal as I would have them, but they are massively more liberal in many respects.\n\n&gt;Pay lipservice towards liberal ideals and bettering the common man and then do nothing other than maintain the status quo\n\nFor a party that does nothing, I sure have heard quite the outcry about Mr. Nazi Obama and how he's been ruining this country with his Socialism... and I guess you think healthcare reform, pushing for immigration reform -- I'll remind you that the House has been sitting on an immigration bill from the Senate for quite a while, and they haven't even be allowed to vote on it by Mr. Boehner; but sure, they do literally nothing *eye roll* -- and pushing legislation for equal pay and treatment for women is totally the \"status quo\". Again, the reaction I hear from the other side is outcries of socialism and communism and the sky falling. That's not exactly the reaction I expect to hear to maintaining the \"status quo\".\n\n**NEWSFLASH**!! Doing things you don't like is not the same as \"doing nothing\".\n\n&gt;do nothing other than maintain the status quo and distract you by making a bunch of noise about social issues... wait... which party does that again?\n\nDistracting you with social issues, eh?\n\nI happen to think that health care (as if this isn't an economic issue **LOL**) and civil rights are a big deal, but I also am guessing that you're leaving out welfare, unemployment, and wage issues as \"social\" issues? Because those totally don't have a huge economic impact */s*; and besides, we totally don't hear about those from the left....\n\nTo answer your question, however, that would be both parties.
