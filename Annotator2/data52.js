This is not some sort of prescriptivist rule, by the by - just an observation based on a broad range of written (and spoken) material. Speech is *always* going to be somewhat less formal than writing, so it's acceptable for the president to use \"you\" in the State of the Union Address.

How he made it to top 4, I don't know. \n\nIt feels like they keep some people in for entertainment purposes. Please, change my view! \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That's what happened to Leslie, unequivocally (and also Lynn in Season 4). I will say, though... there's a lot more sugar in a Boston Cream Pie than in a raised donut, which is often a savory device anyway.\n\nWhen you have 2 contestants that have problems at the same time like Courtney and Kira, without either one having anything outstanding, that is a situation where there's considerable room for the kind of bias you're talking about.\n\n It's pretty hard to say that *either* one didn't deserve to leave that time. Courtney had one significant flaw, but Kira's filled donuts both had no filling, and tasted bad. Cutter could also have been booted, but his flaws were less severe. \n\nThere are many times when I think they should have either eliminated 2 contestants or none at all, but that's a very sparingly used plot device on Master Chef, unlike say Hell's Kitchen where it's quite common. They pretty much stick to the \"well, we have to eliminate exactly one contestant\" format of that particular show.\n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2o66aa", "body": "https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/825334990873936/?type=1\n\nInspired from the link above. If you can't see it, it's a picture of a woman taken in new york with the caption that she only believes her hair and hands to be beautiful. Unsurprisingly, the thread has been inundated with comments from people (most of them women) telling her that she is being too hard on herself, that she is gorgeous, that she should appreciate youth, and other platitudes. While I get that these people are coming from a good place, I don't think it's the right thing to do for the following reasons.\n\nIt's ultimately very condescending. What the commenters are saying when they say \"You're wrong, you're beautiful!!!11!!\" is that is in capable of objectively analyzing herself and that she has to defer to strangers for that information that she can't discern for herself. I think it's very clear to her that she is not a runway model and that she is a little obese, so trying to tell her that she can't see herself properly in the mirror comes off more as an insult, or a \"you're just saying that to make me feel better\" moment.\n\nI also think that it's a good thing when people can look at themselves in an objective way. Very few people face their own flaws and never do anything about them because they are fed this \"love yourself no matter what\" BS, so they go on with a bad personality or a bad diet and never wonder what they are doing wrong, but instead blame other people (Or in this case, the media) for their problems. \n\nI can appreciate people who see the flaws in themselves because then they can take the next step and work to improve themselves. In terms of beauty, I believe that most of it is controllable through dress, hairstyle, and most importantly, maintaining health. They are all controllable things and we all have the power to take control of that. This is what I believe people should put more emphasis on if someone questions their appearance. Tell them that if they don't like how they look, then they have the power to change it and that you believe that they can. \n\nEDIT:I've softened my stance due to a post that showed there there are situations where this could be appropriate. I appreciate all the comments and discussion, but I believe it's time to move on to the next thing."}, {"id": "cmk2may", "body": "Your use of \"beauty\" and \"objective\" in the same sentence is the major flaw in your argument.

Like agreeing when your friend says some girl is hot, or saying this facebook girl is attractive when she isn't (to me or you apparently). Obviously some dude might fall in love with her, multiple maybe, and everyone has personal choices, but there's definitely a popular taste in beauty which we'd agree on. \n\nSo instead of saying we shouldn't tell people they're beautiful.

They should go with their biological sex, if they dont feel as the opposite.\n\nGender expression: Isn't this again based on stereotypes?

If they weren't you would hopefully change that, unless you are afraid of the consequences or something. Genderqueer? wut? \n\nIf I understood it correctly it's gender identity which it is the most focus on. Its the binary of the gender identity which is the \"gender binary\", right? Or are all of these points a part of what you define as \"gender\"?\n\nI believe all of these expressions are made up by people who want to feel different and special.

If you haven't been there, its full of pictures of what people have put up on their tumblr pages, making fun of their thoughts about feminism and \"social justice\". I couldn't really understand the humor of it though, because all of the posts there revolve around a concept I didn't know about, with confusing words such as \"cisgender\", \"gender binary\" as well as \"kins\" etc. After finally understanding the humor of the entire thing, I've become really interested in the all of these definitions. \n\nI was suprised to learn that not believing in a gender binary however was considered PC.

If you happen to go more for women than men, that would still render you bi. I dont see the reason for the spectrum.\n\nBiological Sex: I only believe in male and female. Not intersex nor anything inbetween. If you happen to be transgendered, then I guess you would also want an operation to completely change into the other sex, thus making you the other biological sex. (If you are refering to the biological sex the body has for some in depth medical reason, then I think that just needs to stay between you and the doctor). If you happend to be born with both sets of reproductive organs then you still are one of the two, completely biologically - you'd just need an operation. So yeah, I have no idea what intersex means. If someone says they dont feel as if they are either a boy or a girl and therefore invented that intersex thing, I'd say they are basing that upon gender stereotypes - which is a somewhat bad thing. They should go with their biological sex, if they dont feel as the opposite.\n\nGender expression: Isn't this again based on stereotypes? I guess you could rank someone on your perception of how masculine and feminine they are, but that is still based on your perseptions on what boys and girls should be like. I mean.. I dont really see the point of there being a graph for that.. And I dont see why anyone would want to come across as \"androgynous\", but why we have a term for that suprises me even more. \n\nGender Identity: You are either a man or a woman. Atleast thats what I believe. As I mentioned in the paragraph about biological sex; I dont understand why these two wouldnt be the same. If they weren't you would hopefully change that, unless you are afraid of the consequences or something. Genderqueer? wut? \n\nIf I understood it correctly it's gender identity which it is the most focus on. Its the binary of the gender identity which is the \"gender binary\", right? Or are all of these points a part of what you define as \"gender\"?\n\nI believe all of these expressions are made up by people who want to feel different and special. They happen to not feel exactly like the rest, (much like everyone else, ever) and therefore think there is something special about them.

If you haven't been there, its full of pictures of what people have put up on their tumblr pages, making fun of their thoughts about feminism and \"social justice\". I couldn't really understand the humor of it though, because all of the posts there revolve around a concept I didn't know about, with confusing words such as \"cisgender\", \"gender binary\" as well as \"kins\" etc. After finally understanding the humor of the entire thing, I've become really interested in the all of these definitions. \n\nI was suprised to learn that not believing in a gender binary however was considered PC. Moreover, after checking out a couple of TEDx talks and articles I have found that they all [reference these four graphs or scales](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1600-Genderbread-Person.jpg). I'll just go through all of these expressions and tell you what I believe. \n\nSexual Orientation: I believe in the three terms for sexual orientation, but I dont see any reason to have a graph or a scale, there is no reason to put someone for instance inbetween straight and gay. If you happen to go more for women than men, that would still render you bi. I dont see the reason for the spectrum.\n\nBiological Sex: I only believe in male and female. Not intersex nor anything inbetween. If you happen to be transgendered, then I guess you would also want an operation to completely change into the other sex, thus making you the other biological sex. (If you are refering to the biological sex the body has for some in depth medical reason, then I think that just needs to stay between you and the doctor). If you happend to be born with both sets of reproductive organs then you still are one of the two, completely biologically - you'd just need an operation. So yeah, I have no idea what intersex means. If someone says they dont feel as if they are either a boy or a girl and therefore invented that intersex thing, I'd say they are basing that upon gender stereotypes - which is a somewhat bad thing. They should go with their biological sex, if they dont feel as the opposite.\n\nGender expression: Isn't this again based on stereotypes? I guess you could rank someone on your perception of how masculine and feminine they are, but that is still based on your perseptions on what boys and girls should be like. I mean.. I dont really see the point of there being a graph for that.. And I dont see why anyone would want to come across as \"androgynous\", but why we have a term for that suprises me even more. \n\nGender Identity: You are either a man or a woman. Atleast thats what I believe. As I mentioned in the paragraph about biological sex; I dont understand why these two wouldnt be the same. If they weren't you would hopefully change that, unless you are afraid of the consequences or something. Genderqueer? wut? \n\nIf I understood it correctly it's gender identity which it is the most focus on. Its the binary of the gender identity which is the \"gender binary\", right? Or are all of these points a part of what you define as \"gender\"?\n\nI believe all of these expressions are made up by people who want to feel different and special. They happen to not feel exactly like the rest, (much like everyone else, ever) and therefore think there is something special about them. I think this is also the case for the \"kins\", for those of you who's been on /r/tumblrinaction.\n\nThanks!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If you happen to go more for women than men, that would still render you bi. I dont see the reason for the spectrum.\n\nWhile you might not bother putting your exact [Kinsey scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale) rating on a dating profile, that spectrum is still a handy concept to know of when it comes to understanding yourself and your own desires.\n\nI'd wager most straight people would rate themselves a zero on that scale without actually thinking about it.  That means \"Exclusively heterosexual\".  They're a guy and they know they like girls.  Or they're a girl, and they know they like guys.  They aren't gay or anything!  So why bother with this spectrum stuff!\n\nBut what if at some point during their life, they met *one* person of the same sex that they did feel attracted to?  Something random about that person's style just hit their buttons somehow and they felt a strong attraction they'd never felt at all from the same sex before.  Or maybe they got to know and admire someone well enough that they fell in love, even though they only feel a mild physical attraction compared to their usual stronger attraction to the opposite sex.\n\nSomeone who'd always assumed they were \"totally straight\" might have a real crisis of identity at this point.  Does this mean they're gay now?  Or should they go around saying they're bi all the time even though they normally don't care about dating both genders at all, it was just this one time with this one person and it'll probably never come up again!\n\nI'd tell them to just go for it, and bump themselves up to a 1 on the scale. (Predominantly heterosexual, only incidentally homosexual) Problem solved.\n\nOr what if someone is usually attracted to the opposite sex, and only has ongoing relationships with the opposite sex, but they do enjoy getting a little wild making out with people of the same sex when they're out clubbing?  Maybe rate them a 2. They don't take it too seriously or go too far, but they try it a lot as opposed to a one-off freak occurrence.\n\nThese are just hypothetical examples, to show that it's possible to still have *some* contact or desire for the opposite sex while still thinking of yourself as predominantly straight most of the time.  For people in the 1-2 range, maybe they were game enough to experiment while they were young, but found that they certainly do prefer to stick with the opposite sex more, and there's no point in calling themselves \"bi\" into the future when they're only actively looking for straight relationships.  Or maybe they still feel occasional attractions for the same sex, but they're only interested in settling down seriously in a straight relationship, since they want kids through natural childbirth.\n\nBut they're definitely not a *zero* on the scale.  Whatever their individual reasons, by acknowledging the spectrum, they can do things with the opposite sex on rare occasions, or just feel random attractions they never act on, without feeling like they have to rewrite their whole identity."}, {"id": "2o65my", "body": "Hi!\n\nIt wasnt that long ago when I shown the subreddit /r/tumblrinaction, by a friend of mine.

If someone says they dont feel as if they are either a boy or a girl and therefore invented that intersex thing, I'd say they are basing that upon gender stereotypes - which is a somewhat bad thing. They should go with their biological sex, if they dont feel as the opposite.\n\nGender expression: Isn't this again based on stereotypes? I guess you could rank someone on your perception of how masculine and feminine they are, but that is still based on your perseptions on what boys and girls should be like. I mean.. I dont really see the point of there being a graph for that.. And I dont see why anyone would want to come across as \"androgynous\", but why we have a term for that suprises me even more. \n\nGender Identity: You are either a man or a woman.

If they weren't you would hopefully change that, unless you are afraid of the consequences or something. Genderqueer? wut? \n\nIf I understood it correctly it's gender identity which it is the most focus on. Its the binary of the gender identity which is the \"gender binary\", right? Or are all of these points a part of what you define as \"gender\"?\n\nI believe all of these expressions are made up by people who want to feel different and special.

"}, {"id": "2o65my", "body": "Hi!\n\nIt wasnt that long ago when I shown the subreddit /r/tumblrinaction, by a friend of mine. If you haven't been there, its full of pictures of what people have put up on their tumblr pages, making fun of their thoughts about feminism and \"social justice\". I couldn't really understand the humor of it though, because all of the posts there revolve around a concept I didn't know about, with confusing words such as \"cisgender\", \"gender binary\" as well as \"kins\" etc. After finally understanding the humor of the entire thing, I've become really interested in the all of these definitions. \n\nI was suprised to learn that not believing in a gender binary however was considered PC. Moreover, after checking out a couple of TEDx talks and articles I have found that they all [reference these four graphs or scales](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1600-Genderbread-Person.jpg). I'll just go through all of these expressions and tell you what I believe. \n\nSexual Orientation: I believe in the three terms for sexual orientation, but I dont see any reason to have a graph or a scale, there is no reason to put someone for instance inbetween straight and gay. If you happen to go more for women than men, that would still render you bi. I dont see the reason for the spectrum.\n\nBiological Sex: I only believe in male and female. Not intersex nor anything inbetween. If you happen to be transgendered, then I guess you would also want an operation to completely change into the other sex, thus making you the other biological sex. (If you are refering to the biological sex the body has for some in depth medical reason, then I think that just needs to stay between you and the doctor). If you happend to be born with both sets of reproductive organs then you still are one of the two, completely biologically - you'd just need an operation. So yeah, I have no idea what intersex means. If someone says they dont feel as if they are either a boy or a girl and therefore invented that intersex thing, I'd say they are basing that upon gender stereotypes - which is a somewhat bad thing. They should go with their biological sex, if they dont feel as the opposite.\n\nGender expression: Isn't this again based on stereotypes? I guess you could rank someone on your perception of how masculine and feminine they are, but that is still based on your perseptions on what boys and girls should be like. I mean.. I dont really see the point of there being a graph for that.. And I dont see why anyone would want to come across as \"androgynous\", but why we have a term for that suprises me even more. \n\nGender Identity: You are either a man or a woman. Atleast thats what I believe. As I mentioned in the paragraph about biological sex; I dont understand why these two wouldnt be the same. If they weren't you would hopefully change that, unless you are afraid of the consequences or something. Genderqueer? wut? \n\nIf I understood it correctly it's gender identity which it is the most focus on. Its the binary of the gender identity which is the \"gender binary\", right? Or are all of these points a part of what you define as \"gender\"?\n\nI believe all of these expressions are made up by people who want to feel different and special. They happen to not feel exactly like the rest, (much like everyone else, ever) and therefore think there is something special about them. I think this is also the case for the \"kins\", for those of you who's been on /r/tumblrinaction.\n\nThanks!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If you identify as a girl because X, Y, Z and I am a girl, but don't X, Y, Z - well now people are going to be making X, Y, Z assumptions about me - so I can't really describe myself as a girl anymore unless i want people to jump to conclusions about my personality. \n\nthe real movement should have been to eliminate gender, not further sub-categorise it. so that we were getting to the point that saying 'i'm a girl' indicates only physical and anatomical things about me and no assumptions can be made about my personality. but we've gone the opposite way where we're instead hunting for that perfect 1-word to describe the personalities of multiple human beings.

It may be a convenient argument for you to make but it has very little to do with anything particularly \"English\". \n\nA single language being spoken by all the world's people is hardly a new idea. In fact, it was usually the first thing a conquering force would do when occupying a new land.

Why didn't the British use one of the local Indian languages to run the subcontinent and why did the Indians accept English language government ? Because there are over 300 languages spoken in India and having one common language that has no clear relation to any one of them (therefore ruling out resentment on that front) happens to be an equalizer from an Indian point of view.

In brief, there is no better term, and \"American\" is already established as the usual term. Furthermore, no other country in the Americas is vying for the right for its citizens to be called \"Americans\" -- all the other countries already have their own adjective forms for their citizens (although I do think the adjective form for non-persons should be \"US\" -- as in \"US President\"). \n\nAs for the main premise, I am against calling the country \"America\" for a number of reasons.\n\n1. The full country name is \"The United States **of America**\". This literally means that there are some states that are united and that they are part of a larger entity, namely, America, which of course means the Americas. Contrast with, for example, the Republic of Germany, which is an entity called \"Germany\" that is a republic, rather than a Republic that is a constituent part of something larger called Germany. Logically, the short form of the name should therefore be the United States, the States, the US, or USA, which are all names for the country that already exist. \n\n2. As above, the \"America\" in \"the United States of America\" stands for \"the Americas\". It stands to reason, then, that \"America\" should be used as the overall term for North and South America and their countries and not just for one of the countries.\n\n3. In other countries, \"[America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#Terminology)\" (in the respective languages) already has a meaning pertaining to the continents and not the USA. It is certainly Ameria-centric, then, to expect that these other-language speakers need to shift their world view to \"America = USA\". At the very least, this can cause communication problems: if a Spanish or French speaker refers to \"America\" while speaking English, should I expect them to be meaning USA or the continents? If they hear \"America\", do they know which referent is meant? Do they have to deduce that USA is meant when the speaker is American, but that the continents are meant when the speaker is Canadian?\n\n4. A good number of dictionaries' primary (or [only](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/America)) definitions of \"America\" pertain to its continent-based usage; [others](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/america?showCookiePolicy=true) list its use as synonymous with USA as being specific to USA. This tells us something about how this term is perceived and what people will learn this term to mean when they look it up.\n\nI concede that \"America\" *is* used to mean USA and shouldn't be outlawed, but I believe that this usage is primarily part of the US dialect and relevant primarily only within that dialect. Expecting everyone else worldwide to adhere to or even accept this usage is pointless and counterproductive to clear communication."}, {"id": "2o4gkq", "body": "I feel like people who accuse the United States of having a large Ego solely on the fact that it self-references as America have no basis for their accusations.

Other words that exist but aren't used widely: Yankee, Dixie\n\n&gt;Third, why does Micronesia get to call itself that? Or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Or any other name for that matter. China has part of the Mongolian region in it.\n\nBecause the UK doesn't call itself Kingdom or Great. Micronesia is made up of states exclusively within Polynesia(small islands-micro). China, and pretty much every country's name, doesn't overstep its borders the same way calling the United States America does.\n\n&gt;Fourth, we didn't just pull the name from nowhere. We were known as the British American Colonies. So when we were no longer British we just became American. We had no other identifier than American.\n\nAgain, this is based on the name of the continent, not country. North America.
