For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \n\nNow I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \n\n---------\nEdit*\n\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested.

For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \n\nNow I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \n\n---------\nEdit*\n\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested. If a cop grabs my arm and I pull away he may think in about to get aggressive and he'll tase me or tackle me or accidentally choke me to death for fear of his own safety\n\n\u2206 so the problem is deeper than policy, it's the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws, its the people and traditions. I'd still like to see more protection for civilians but \"allowing\" resisting arrest probably isnt the right avenue, a new generation of judges may be more lenient towards it but thats a different story.\n\n----\n\nEdit**\n\n&gt;Maybe in theory, but is that really a bluff you want to call when the police officer starts saying \"No, you can't walk away. Get back here.\"? \n\n&gt;I don't think that's something we want either, otherwise we've just given the same dangerous latitude to civilians that we currently give to the police when we allow them to exercise deadly force if they \"feel threatened.\"\n\n\u2206 I can't remember the policy on giving out delta's but you're points were very clear.

Someone being arrested has *no idea* what kind of evidence the cops have for arresting them. Obviously the person being arrested shouting \"I didn't do it!\" isn't sufficient grounds for letting them go-- in fact, we can't really trust someone being arrested to be completely honest, we have to go in and weigh their evidence against the evidence against them. And to do that, we need a trial, and to do that, we need to have them arrested.\n\nNow, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but the obvious argument here is \"What if you know 100% for sure you didn't do it?\" Well, you might be innocent, but again, we can't just take your word for it.

You know perfectly well you were out of town.

Maybe the person who killed your neighbor broke into your home first, stole your gun, happened to look similar to you and was identified by witnesses as being someone who looked just like you do.\n\nSo now we've got your murder weapon used to kill someone close to you by someone who witnesses identify as looking exactly like you. You ask me, that's *really good evidence* to arrest someone and take them to trial. And that's where you have your opportunity to submit evidence that you were out of the country, *and* that the locks on your back window were broken, as well as the lockbox where you keep your gun.\n\nSo now you've proved your innocence, justice system worked, good job everyone let's all go home.\n\nBut is there any point there where you think the arrest shouldn't have happened?

I actually had something like this happen to me in high school. teacher was new, older and basically had zero control over the classroom. one overly obnoxious black girl was standing in the middle of the class talking extremely loud with her friend after the teacher asked everyone to sit and be quiet, everyone did so but her. I found this HIGHLY disrespectful and I told her to please be quiet and sit down as the teacher had so clearly asked.       \n\nThis sassy black girl didnt like that, me impeding on her conversation and what not which clearly was a sign me diss'n her or something. She proceeded to curse and yell and say all sorts of horrible nasty things to me. I never yelled or unreasonably raised my voice (ya know, for indoors and what not). Some of my classmates tried to get in on it and I stopped them I said: \"hey, hold on guy, i got this\". Problem was she was resisting, and cursing up a storm and not once did I show aggression nor did I use any foul language or insults. Granted she was clearly in the wrong here, but typically when \"fights\" of any sort break out both parties are usually to blame and are punished accordingly. however when the discipline \"official\" or whatever we called him at the time, showed up at the classroom to haul the offending students away, I was spared and vouched for and she was dragged away to who knows where. See I knew If I didnt become aggressive, curse, yell, and basically break a ton of rules during this little brawl that I couldnt be in the wrong and thus not get in any school yard trouble.

I'm not saying its wrong, but I do not think this is the best reasoning for why arrests are so bad. Humans have other \"natural instincts\" but I think following one's mind, logically, is a better measure of a situation than naturally following your innate desire to rebel against arrest.\n\nNow, I agree that jail time/arrest time is bad and could be significantly bad in some cases (bear in mind, I've never been in jail and this is only things I've read). Time wasted in jail when your family, friends, or coworkers may need you, potential beatings/r***, and just mental trauma are indeed awful and ideally no one would have to go through that. In that sense, I can understand many people not wanting to be arrested. (if I missed any crucial details, please let me know)\n\nBut, society isn't perfect, and there's no way (currently at least) to immediately test a suspect. So I think it comes down to a choice between the police's suspicions of an individual versus the individual's needs. But I believe that if individuals are given the right to resist arrest and police aren't able to stop them, this can lead to a lot of scenarios of truly bad people getting away with crimes. In exchange, you'll get some good people put away for hopefully short periods of time, and I think that's a worthwhile tradeoff. If something horrible happens to the innocent person in jail/he's treated poorly, they would hopefully be able to recoup their losses in court.\n\nI would also address how many think a lot of police seem to get off easily/not so easily, but I think that's a whole 'nother conversation."}, {"id": "2od6s9", "body": "I've thought this for a long time, and the recent surge in media awareness has brought this idea to the forefront of my mind. \"Resisting arrest\" is currently a felony offense in multiple states (USA..) but anecdotally the charge is used to basically trump up the 'offenses' committed by the perp.

State, 136 Ind. 306. This premise was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case: John Bad Elk v. U.S., 177 U.S. 529. The Court stated: \u201cWhere the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right. What may be murder in the first case might be nothing more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no offense had been committed.\u201d\n\u201cAn arrest made with a defective warrant, or one issued without affidavit, or one that fails to allege a crime is within jurisdiction, and one who is being arrested, may resist arrest and break away. lf the arresting officer is killed by one who is so resisting, the killing will be no more than an involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Housh v. People, 75 111. 491; reaffirmed and quoted in State v. Leach, 7 Conn. 452; State v. Gleason, 32 Kan. 245; Ballard v. State, 43 Ohio 349; State v Rousseau, 241 P. 2d 447; State v. Spaulding, 34 Minn. 3621.\n\u201cWhen a person, being without fault, is in a place where he has a right to be, is violently assaulted, he may, without retreating, repel by force, and if, in the reasonable exercise of his right of self defense, his assailant is killed, he is justified.\u201d Runyan v. State, 57 Ind. 80; Miller v. State, 74 Ind. 1.\n\u201cThese principles apply as well to an officer attempting to make an arrest, who abuses his authority and transcends the bounds thereof by the use of unnecessary force and violence, as they do to a private individual who unlawfully uses such force and violence.\u201d Jones v. State, 26 Tex. App. I; Beaverts v. State, 4 Tex. App. 1 75; Skidmore v. State, 43 Tex. 93, 903.\n\u201cAn illegal arrest is an assault and battery. The person so attempted to be restrained of his liberty has the same right to use force in defending himself as he would in repelling any other assault and battery.\u201d (State v. Robinson, 145 ME. 77, 72 ATL. 260).\n\u201cEach person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest. In such a case, the person attempting the arrest stands in the position of a wrongdoer and may be resisted by the use of force, as in self- defense.\u201d (State v. Mobley, 240 N.C. 476, 83 S.E. 2d 100).\n\u201cOne may come to the aid of another being unlawfully arrested, just as he may where one is being assaulted, molested, raped or kidnapped. Thus it is not an offense to liberate one from the unlawful custody of an officer, even though he may have submitted to such custody, without resistance.\u201d (Adams v. State, 121 Ga. 16, 48 S.E. 910).\n\u201cStory affirmed the right of self-defense by persons held illegally. In his own writings, he had admitted that \u2018a situation could arise in which the checks-and-balances principle ceased to work and the various branches of government concurred in a gross usurpation.\u2019 There would be no usual remedy by changing the law or passing an amendment to the Constitution, should the oppressed party be a minority. Story concluded, \u2018If there be any remedy at all ... it is a remedy never provided for by human institutions.\u2019 That was the \u2018ultimate right of all human beings in extreme cases to resist oppression, and to apply force against ruinous injustice.\u2019\u201d (From Mutiny on the Amistad by Howard Jones, Oxford University Press, 1987, an account of the reading of the decision in the case by Justice Joseph Story of the Supreme Court.\nAs for grounds for arrest: \u201cThe carrying of arms in a quiet, peaceable, and orderly manner, concealed on or about the person, is not a breach of the peace. Nor does such an act of itself, lead to a breach of the peace.\u201d (Wharton\u2019s Criminal and Civil Procedure, 12th Ed., Vol.2: Judy v. Lashley, 5 W. Va. 628, 41 S.E. 197).\nYou are also within your rights not to answer any questions without a lawyer present, and if possible, to demand a video recording be made of the entire encounter that you or your lawyer keep as evidence, so that federal prosecutors can't get away with charging you with making false statements to a government investigator and testilying about what you said. See this article.\nAs a practical matter one should try to avoid relying on the above in an actual confrontation with law enforcement agents, who are likely not to know or care about any of it. Some recent courts have refused to follow these principles, and grand juries, controlled by prosecutors, have refused to indict officers who killed innocent people claiming the subject \"resisted\" or \"looked like he might have a gun\". Once dedicated to \"protect and serve\", far too many law enforcement officers have become brutal, lawless occupying military forces.\nSee also:\nFalse arrest \u2014 Wikipedia article\nThe Common-Law Right to Resist, by \"ExCop-LawStudent\", May 5, 2013 \u2014 Makes some valid criticisms of the above article. He is correct that recent precedents and statutes do not support resistance to unlawful arrest, except where excessive force is used, but we regard those to themselves be unconstitutional, and thus null and void, as a matter of principle. Of course, people need to be aware that constitutional principle is not the practice in courts today, and perhaps be prudent about that.\nThe Right to Forcefully Resist Unlawful Arrest, John-Henry Hill, September 30, 2013.\nThe Right to Resist Unlawful Arrest, [No author shown], Natural Resources Journal, Jan. 1967.\nWhen the Right to Resist Becomes the \"Duty to Submit\", William N.

For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \n\nNow I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \n\n---------\nEdit*\n\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested.

For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \n\nNow I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \n\n---------\nEdit*\n\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested. If a cop grabs my arm and I pull away he may think in about to get aggressive and he'll tase me or tackle me or accidentally choke me to death for fear of his own safety\n\n\u2206 so the problem is deeper than policy, it's the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws, its the people and traditions. I'd still like to see more protection for civilians but \"allowing\" resisting arrest probably isnt the right avenue, a new generation of judges may be more lenient towards it but thats a different story.\n\n----\n\nEdit**\n\n&gt;Maybe in theory, but is that really a bluff you want to call when the police officer starts saying \"No, you can't walk away. Get back here.\"? \n\n&gt;I don't think that's something we want either, otherwise we've just given the same dangerous latitude to civilians that we currently give to the police when we allow them to exercise deadly force if they \"feel threatened.\"\n\n\u2206 I can't remember the policy on giving out delta's but you're points were very clear. Especially when you circled back to: \"it's a problem with individual officers, not the system\" while I agree that the officer is obviously the main factor I think there is a systemically induced fear on both sides which is not addressed (and maybe even escalated) by allowing civilians to resist.\n\n----"}, {"id": "cmm1rz3", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cmm1rz3", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cmm2v2j", "body": "Sorry ControlD, your comment has been removed: \n\n&gt; Comment Rule 2\\. \"Don't be rude or hostile to other users.

Learn to understand your audience on a personal level and figure out just why they hold their views so you can make them stick their nose in their own cognitive dissonance. \n\nIt's hard. Yeah.

You just see it in higher definition on here because there aren't necessarily images attached and because there are so many niches.\n\nI agree, though, that the format of the site doesn't really do anything to push boundaries or challenge ideas. I also agree that this is extremely unfortunate. Reddit has the power to make better citizens instead of letting people sit back and indulge in mindless consumption of cat pictures and the occasional story of someone somewhere \"fighting the man.\" Because, you know, fuck Comcast et al., but it's easier to upvote that story rather than actually *do* something about it. Volunteer work? I wonder whether the most prolific Redditors have ever even had a *paid* job!

I have not tried my best. I don't think I've ever tried my best. Growing up I was always quiet and polite, and never really got in trouble. At school I was bright enough to coast through everything, and now I have a job, I earn decent money, I support myself. It's okay, but it doesn't light my fire. When I come home in the evening to spend it with my boyfriend - whom I love, very much - I do a few things I enjoy (reading, playing video games, redditing, cuddling and watching a film) and a few more boring things (make dinner, tidy up a bit, get ready for the next day). And that's kind of it. I live for the weekends when I can have a lie in, game a lot, and especially at the moment, get ready for Christmas.\n\nI've been thinking recently that maybe there should be more to life than this. Like, I really want to write a novel - or, maybe it would be nice to do something I love, for a job. I don't know what that would be, though. Maybe it would be nice to move into a smaller house so I could save a little money. Maybe I could learn to drive. Things like that. But then I think well... what's the point? I'm pretty happy as I am now. I'm certainly not doing my 'best', but that seems like such hard work when I'm already competent and content at the moment. Why would I over exert myself when I've already got to where I need to be?\n\nI have a few friends who are into self betterment, keeping fit, healthy, etc. I admire them, but I have no motivation or thought to better myself or do the same. I have a gym membership that I go to occasionally if I start to put on a little weight, until it goes off again. What would 'doing my best' achieve that I don't already have? Does it change the way you view the world? Does operating at your best make everything awesome? Do you get everything you want? Doesn't is just set you up to fail, on those days you don't manage your best?\n\nA lot of self-help stuff is about trying your best to do something. But sometimes, someone's best is shit. And sometimes, someone's not-very-much-effort is amazing. Nobody seems to want to say that very much. People seem to think \"Well it doesn't how well you do, as long as you try your best\" - but I disagree. I think all that matters is how well you do. No one's going to get to the end of their life and go \"Well at least I tried\" - or do they? I don't know.\n\nThere must be meaning in doing one's best, because so many people do it, or aim for it. But I don't see it at all. CMV?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Now you practise all day and managed to do a time of 3:28, and this put you in first place.  Wheee.  But what if you keep practising, and you lower that to 3:25, 3:22 and finally 3:21 and can't move it form there in days of practise.  You are now at your new best.  You already were #1 but you were not at your best.  You ave yourself a present of maxing out your little GTA V car racing skill in that one track.  \n\nThis might seem like a silly self-competing example, but there is a lot of this in many disciplines.  In martial arts, sports, work, studies, relationships and anything else, you have a lot more to give, and this gets the best out of you.  \n\nStupid example: in [japanese fencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTDL5KW12d0) you have to always give more then you have.  Passing out is almost admired, and doing something exhausting and not stopping is considered standard.  After years of this I learned to always know my body can do much more.  When your muscles tell you \"this is it, we are done, we can't continue\" your mind goes \"nonsense, we keep going, we are not even half way\" and your muscles obey.  Now imagine applying this to sex.  You can't imagine how much a SO appreciated this.  \n\nAnd I think when you are at the end of your life and feel you gave everything and took nothing to the grave with you, life is more complete and happier.  But maybe that's just me.

I haven't spent masses of time at the gym I go to, but I have spent enough to know this feel (even a little); I've always found it fascinating, how the body can feel like it's at the end of its tether, but the mind kicks in with \"Nup, you can still do more\".

He says \"I'm sorry, but you miss most classes, you don't do homework, and this is the first time you've talked to me. I can't help you.\" After hearing this, my friend gets worried, but she has to try something.

I often wonder why I am okay knowing I have the potential to do so much but still sometimes find myself feeling completely disinterested in fully realizing this potential. \n\nWhat usually gets me out of this apathetic attitude and back into fighting spirit is simply taking a step back, and forgetting about the whole \"realizing my potential\" thing. \n\nExample: A couple months back, I decided I wanted to put some significant time into improving my kick serve (tennis). One of the main reasons I was doing this was that I was preparing for an upcoming tournament, and I wanted to make sure my serve was reliable. But on the day that I had decided I would go to the courts and practice, I found myself sitting on my couch and sort of wondering what the point of it all was. Why should I waste an hour or two of my day working on a single aspect of my tennis game? Why can't I just go casually play with my friends or co-workers like I usually do, where I just get to have fun hitting the ball without worrying about my technique, my consistency, my conditioning, etc.? Why am I even pushing myself to play in tournaments when I know I often crumble under pressure? Some people seem to enjoy playing in a serious atmosphere, but I definitely don't. Sure, pushing myself to go through all this might make me a better player, but I'm already plenty good. Much better than the average player, to be honest. Why stress myself out trying to be even better?\n\nEssentially, I was all but set to give up on the idea of making the long walk to my neighborhood's tennis courts and just relaxing at home. But some small part of me (I feel like you, OP, must also have some very similar \"small part of you\", or else you wouldn't have made this CMV) seemed to be dissatisfied with where things were headed. This small part of me was struggling to remind myself why I ever got good at tennis in the first place. It wasn't really because I wanted to be the best. It wasn't because other people around me were improving, and I felt like there was an expectation for me to keep up with them. It wasn't because I felt like my life felt unfulfilled without getting better. It was purely because I *liked* what I was doing everyday - playing this sport that I innocently decided to pick up on some fateful day of my life. \n\nI love smacking a fuzzy neon ball as hard as I can, and watching as people struggle (to no avail) to reach it. I get a huge sense of satisfaction in smacking the ball and hearing that /*pop/* that signifies you hit a clean shot right in the middle of the frame. I love noticing how parts of my game that I previously felt sucked start to get better and better with practice, knowing that my diligence is paying off. I love being able to add more \"weapons\" to my arsenal as I learn how to better execute dropshots, volleys, slices, and so on. With more tools in my belt, I get to be more creative with my strategies, and even get to start mimicking cool things that I might have seen pros do on ESPN the night before. Practicing my kick serve isn't supposed to be a chore, even though I was inadvertently making it out to be one. The difference was simply in perspective, and I just needed to remind myself: I am trying to get better because I want to. Not because of some far-off goal that I want to be the best player in the nation or something. Getting to say I am a better tennis player and winning tournaments is *simply a happy side effect* of my natural desire to keep playing and keep improving. When I was able to re-frame things this way in my mind, you bet I was out the door and on my way to the courts.\n\nJust wanted to humbly share my own experience that I thought might relate. If this is off the mark and isn't really what you were looking for, then I'll just say thanks for giving me the opportunity and motivation to think about this topic myself and to remember what my motivation is for a lot of things in my life!"}, {"id": "2oalss", "body": "I've recently realised that the way I live my life is not the best.

They tend to heavily favor their own field of expertise and other areas that interest them, while downplaying the importance of areas that don't peak their interest, or that they don't agree with.  Starting with the premise that certain fields are inherently better is the first step towards close-mindedness.  One area you don't value personally may contribute something to society that you hadn't considered.\n\nSecond, humans are not purely utilitarian.  So much of what we do and where we gain pleasure is in frivoulousness.  Sure, science may help us feed more people and grow the economy, but so much of the spice of life lies in the arts.

In an at-will state, the standard is pretty much \"any evidence that'll convince your boss\" or even \"not obviously innocent\" if your boss doesn't like you. Even when you throw in powerful unions (vanishingly rare in the private sector) and arbitration, the standard is still pretty much \"preponderance of the evidence\", which is much looser than \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". So there are a lot of cases where a prosecutor might not be sure he can get a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" but a university or employer or agency could fire/discipline/etc based on much less.\n\nAdditionally, a private employer doesn't have the same \"due process\" investigative restrictions in a lot of areas. They can generally compel your assistance with their investigation in ways that a prosecutor couldn't - if you \"plead the 5th\" they can just fire you. They don't need any sort of warrant or anything to read your work emails or work computer's browser history or even spy on you with hidden (or not-hidden) cameras.\n\nThirdly (bonus reason), private employers can punish you for things that aren't crimes but are still \"morally\" questionable. For instance, many PEDs are not necessarily illegal, but still have a bad influence on the game (and incentivize other players to take risky drugs just to keep up) and are generally opposed by the public. Similarly, cheating on your physics test isn't a crime. So with the state powerless to prosecute these actions, there's a need for private groups to police them.\n\nTaken together, there's a powerful incentive to have things like NFL/NCAA/university investigations, but they shouldn't be the final, or only, word.

Glorification of war is a bad thing, and going to war too easily is a bad thing, but simply having a military is not.\n\nWe (people who generally oppose wars) have to consider that in the real world, armed conflicts arise whether we like it or not. Having a military can help avoid a conflict spreading to your home country.  This is not to say that all US military involvements are justified or that soldiers always do the right thing. But even if we created a policy that avoided war and intervention, we would require some small military as a defensive force. Having some protection is not morally wrong; using vast military power to hurt others for personal or even national gain is far less moral.

The first is fairly simple: the military has too much ability to kill - the weapons are just too powerful.  The second is more complex: the military is a tool for political elites to kill those with whom they disagree, that these killings will often be unjust, and that the previous two facts imply that the military is morally wrong.  \n\nI'm going to focus on the second argument because the first argument relies upon it.  The capacity to kill only seems morally relevant insofar as the capacity is used (or likely to be used) unjustly.  I would tend to agree with you on the first two statements.  It is a tragedy that there is a system set up that involves sending a poor kid who just wants to pay for college off to kill (or be killed by) another poor kid who was conscripted by his country or a civilian who didn't do anything wrong besides living in the wrong place.  However, I would disagree with your assertion that the military as a whole is morally wrong.  The military exists because it is very easy to get around peaceful mechanisms for resolving disputes without it.  If the two of us are arguing over something, resorting to violence is an easy way out unless there's some force there to stop us.  Within the state, that force is the police.  Outside of the state, no such force exists.  Each country has to provide its own protection in the form of the military.  While the world might be better if no country did so, when a conflict arose, there would be a huge pressure for every country to arm itself so that it could get what it wants.  \n\nSo, I would disagree that the military is wrong because it is necessary.  A country cannot exist without some mechanism for providing security, and there is no evidence that people (setting aside hermits) can be secure without the protections afforded by a country and a military in some form.  Additionally, the military needs to be subject to oversight and needs to take its orders from someone else.  Clausewitz famously referred to war as politics by other means - an attempt to compel an enemy to do your will by force.  The military is a tool, bound by a set of rules and a system of oversight (these of course vary in effectiveness and scope from country to country) to ensure that its actions are designed to attain the political goals of those who control it.  If it could decide to do whatever it wanted, the result would be chaos.  The fact that elites tend to use the military in the wrong ways says more about the mechanisms used to select, reward, and punish those elites than it does about the military itself.   \n\nThis probably won't change your mind about joining the military, not liking the ways the military is used is a totally reasonable reason to refrain from joining.  But I don't think you should blame the military for the ways it is used, you should blame the people who misuse it and the system that is set up to make it easy for them to do so.
