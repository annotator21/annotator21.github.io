The main reason that alcohol regulation is much more lax at the federal level is because the [repeal of prohibition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) put alcohol regulation (up to and including bans) largely in state hands.  \n\nThe only caveat I'll say in regard to calorie labeling specifically is that I don't know how much variance takes place in some beverages.

Religion is a nice, easy route for them to take. However, I believe that these people would still be out there looking for destruction outside of religion.\n\nLet's do a thought experiment though.  Imagine you are in the place of one of the 9/11 hijackers, and you lived in a world without religion.  Instead, the leaders of al Qaeda were honest and had to recruit you based on the facts.  Would you be easily swayed by, \"Hi, I'm bin Laden, and I want you to go end your life on this planet and no longer exist because I think the U.S. sucks.  Oh yeah, I won't do it myself because I value my life, so you go end your pointless life for me.  Nothing else waits for you but oblivion.\"  How hard would it be for terrorists to recruit people to suicide missions without religion?  Sure, it's still possible, but it's much harder to do.  In fact, I would consider that the majority of \"suicide missions\" would only take place as a defensive measure of last resort if it weren't for religion.\n\n&gt; I think everyday crime and general lack of want to do good would be rampant.\n\nSo we've got secular nations such as Germany that have thriving economies and much stronger social safety nets than religions nations such as the U.S., but also they have less people in prison that we do.  However, take a look at the people in prison.  The majority will claim to be religious.  Homeless people also always claim to be religious on their signs or when they beg on the streets.  Either they're faking it as a form of social engineering, or their religion has failed them.\n\n&gt; Those people who are currently receiving direction from god to live \"good lives\" would have no direction. This alone could be enough to stop people from doing things that society agreed isn't correct.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.  For example, the most religious states are the ones that have the most people on welfare and the ones that have higher rates of teen pregnancies.  Religion tries to control people, but in reality it holds society and individuals back by promoting myths rather than proven scientific solutions to problems we face.\n\n&gt; Very common in the US, people don't always wish to follow the laws of society created by men, but will fear repercussions from the Devine. Do not underestimate the control that the fear of eternal damnation has on people (even at a subconscious level).\n\nWe jail a higher percentage of our population than any other nation on Earth.  We also have an extremely corrupt form of government with the worst party using the cover of religion to dismantle any benefits the majority gain from society.  Fear of divine retribution doesn't seem to affect those in power, only those under control.\n\n&gt; Also, please remember that various religions were created out of necessity to keep people under control. I do not believe that society is mature enough, or ready, for this measure of control to be lifted.\n\nYou're right that it was created to keep people under control, but whether you like it or not it is being lifted.  I personally grew up religious and as an adult unchained myself from it because it was a hindrance to living an authentic life appreciating each moment.

Imagine you are in the place of one of the 9/11 hijackers, and you lived in a world without religion.  Instead, the leaders of al Qaeda were honest and had to recruit you based on the facts.  Would you be easily swayed by, \"Hi, I'm bin Laden, and I want you to go end your life on this planet and no longer exist because I think the U.S. sucks.  Oh yeah, I won't do it myself because I value my life, so you go end your pointless life for me.  Nothing else waits for you but oblivion.\"  How hard would it be for terrorists to recruit people to suicide missions without religion?  Sure, it's still possible, but it's much harder to do.  In fact, I would consider that the majority of \"suicide missions\" would only take place as a defensive measure of last resort if it weren't for religion.\n\n&gt; I think everyday crime and general lack of want to do good would be rampant.\n\nSo we've got secular nations such as Germany that have thriving economies and much stronger social safety nets than religions nations such as the U.S., but also they have less people in prison that we do.  However, take a look at the people in prison.  The majority will claim to be religious.  Homeless people also always claim to be religious on their signs or when they beg on the streets.  Either they're faking it as a form of social engineering, or their religion has failed them.\n\n&gt; Those people who are currently receiving direction from god to live \"good lives\" would have no direction. This alone could be enough to stop people from doing things that society agreed isn't correct.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.  For example, the most religious states are the ones that have the most people on welfare and the ones that have higher rates of teen pregnancies.  Religion tries to control people, but in reality it holds society and individuals back by promoting myths rather than proven scientific solutions to problems we face.\n\n&gt; Very common in the US, people don't always wish to follow the laws of society created by men, but will fear repercussions from the Devine. Do not underestimate the control that the fear of eternal damnation has on people (even at a subconscious level).\n\nWe jail a higher percentage of our population than any other nation on Earth.  We also have an extremely corrupt form of government with the worst party using the cover of religion to dismantle any benefits the majority gain from society.  Fear of divine retribution doesn't seem to affect those in power, only those under control.\n\n&gt; Also, please remember that various religions were created out of necessity to keep people under control. I do not believe that society is mature enough, or ready, for this measure of control to be lifted.\n\nYou're right that it was created to keep people under control, but whether you like it or not it is being lifted.  I personally grew up religious and as an adult unchained myself from it because it was a hindrance to living an authentic life appreciating each moment.  Religion is meant to control people as an \"opiate of the masses\" and the few benefits it provides could be done in many other ways.\n"}, {"id": "cmvn3f8", "body": "I feel that you are overly aggressive and throwing out fallacies, as a result.

I don't believe in the supernatural or an afterlife, yet I have no interest in stealing, for example.  This moral works on a purely human level where we hate to have our stuff stolen so we should oppose stealing in general.  It doesn't require religious beliefs.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, I believe you are being harsh criticizing the 85% of the US population that believe in a higher power. 84.9% of these people are not \"radicals\" or \"fanatics\". They are simply looking for an explanation as to why we are, where we are going, and why it matters.\n\nI'm not sure where I harshly criticized them to be able to address this.  I will harshly criticize ideas, but not the people who hold them.  We're all stupid when it comes to something, including myself.  However, belief in an invisible sky giant who wants to make sure your local sports team wins their championship game but killed your grandma before you could see her one last time isn't logical.\n\n&gt; I agree that everyone should enjoy every moment of their lives here on Earth, but why does this have to conflict with the belief in higher power?\n\nIt's because religions are a tool to control people used by the powerful.  The way they do this is to get them to sacrifice things in their lives (or sometimes their very lives) to facilitate the needs of the church.  It's often a promise of delayed gratification -- e.g. \"if you don't sleep with someone else before marriage you'll get heavenly rewards\" or \"if you are poor it's ok because you'll be rich in the afterlife.\"\n\n&gt; The last point I will bring up, before I close, is that the laws and customs that we have today are a direct result of these religions that you are against.\n\nI disagree with that.  Things like the enlightenment and modern law are more rooted in the logic and philosophy of the ancient Greeks than they are of any Judaic religion, for example.  The bible is full of what we would consider injustice, even genocide, and suffering.  The same could apply to many major religions if not most of their histories.\n\n&gt; Where will society be when this base erodes? Will the things that we believe are right and wrong today still hold true hundreds of years after religions are no longer common place? \n\nIt might be a bit cliche but we've most past the morals of religion in so many ways.  Christianity justifies slavery, yet it's been banned over several generations here.  We're in the process of eliminating bigotry against homosexuals (and this isn't a new thing, as it was widely practiced even in the time of Jesus.)\n\n&gt; We can't know for sure, but I'm inclined to think that society will continue on the path of egotism, selfishness, and lack of family bonds.\n\nWe've always been like this, it's just that our modern technology has enabled us to take it further.  However, we are living in a society with longer lives, less crime, and better access to food and healthcare than in the past.  Yes, not everyone globally has this, but you and I do, so from my perspective this is an improvement over the past.  We have created lots of challenges for ourselves as well, but I also feel that there's always a possibility of reaching new levels of improvement for mankind.\n\n&gt; You point out the fire and brimstone, but are not giving any credit whatsoever to the finer points of peoples religions.\n\nIt's because I personally do not see concrete benefits of those religions.  At best, they function as a crutch in my opinion.\n\n&gt; Hey - I have an idea! Let's forgo religion all together and leave it up to our governments to tell us what to believe and how to conduct our lives!\n\nIf this is a democratically-controlled government (in some manner, not necessarily direct democracy) then that is an improvement.  The reason is because a government of the people and for the people requires a consensus to operate, while a religious society operates as a form of tyranny where the rules are dictated from the top down.  That being said, I don't think the U.S. government is the way to go, just that better forms of governments do exist and are used to improve lives for the citizens of the countries that live in them."}, {"id": "cmv0ok1", "body": "I think you underestimate how powerful a force the idea of a god is to everyday people in everyday life. Your assumption that without religion, people's moral compass would be the same is incorrect IMO. I believe that even the thought of karma/eternal damnation is enough to deter many people (many atheist included) from committing certain acts. I realize that even religious people commit heinous acts/crime, but I believe it would only get worse with less religion. \n\nReligion promotes unity and community values, and as society moves away from these fundamental ideals, we are already beginning to see a lack of caring for your neighbors.

Simply, a person I like asks me that and it seems like this huge test. And I know what the desired answer is. So I'm either gonna lie and hope to God they don't live on a farm or I'll say the truth and have them think I'm either a psycho or a stone-cold bitch.

If hypothetically I have a few hundred applications for a position to fill, what do I do? At some point you need to acknowledge that the goal is *not* to \"find and hire the best candidate for the job\". The goal is to efficiently use your resources to do the best thing for your company, even if that means missing out on a good candidate because its not cost effective to devote that much time and effort into the search.\n\nSo, the reality of it is that employers need a low cost way to whittle down the initial field of applicants. And basing it off 4 year degrees is a VERY cheap first pass, and even though it knocks out some good applicants, which sucks, it does weed out a ton of junk candidates, making the remaining applications more manageable.\n\nThe low cost is a big plus, but its also very reliable. If you graduated, that's an almost universal stamp of approval that you mean some minimum threshold. And its something that doesn't make sense to lie about, as its so easy to verify. But for work experience, its a lot more complicated. You don't \"graduate\" from past jobs, so the fact that you were at some other position for 4 years doesn't really actually say much without digging in and calling references and asking lots of questions. And even then you pretty much have to rely on the specific references provided, which were selected by the applicant and baises the results in favor of them. So even if your non-degree resume looks great, its a lot more expensive to verify. And the bummer of it is that other applicants who are not as good as you can pretty easily make a resume that will look comparable, but won't stand up to scrutiny. So the only way to get to the bottom of it is to do the expensive work of getting in touch with references and past employers, which is a lot of work.\n\nUnless you have a contact in the company through past experience or networking, the unfortunate truth is that on average, applications that look like yours probably aren't worth their time.\n\nAnd if they're getting satisfactory results by filtering out based on degrees, why would they change? You might suspect that there's an even better way of doing it, but here I'm skeptical. If there's this vast untapped pool of high quality workers being completely ignored by most companies, somebody is going to figure this out and exploit it and get a hiring edge. But I don't generally see that happening. These policies also didn't just materialize in a vacuum. They've been adopted gradually over time based on the experience of employers in dealing with applicants The prevalence of this tactic indicates that the people who have the most experience dealing with resumes have collectively decided that on average, candidates with any 4 year degrees are more likely to be hire-able than those without. There are exceptions for sure, but those exceptions are just too expensive to pick out from other similar looking applications."}, {"id": "2paw2l", "body": "I was recently looking around online for a job, as my current contract is coming to an end. Many of the jobs I was looking at required a university/college degree.

No one I know has been able to explain why they want a candidate to have this, so I'm hoping i could get a bit of an explanation on that as well. Now I understand this is all depending on the type of job, and that some in some instances it makes sense that you have a specific degree, but for jobs like doing Administration, or Human Resources, a job that could be taught with simple On Job Training, requiring a person to sit in class for 4 years seems like a waste of time.\n\n\nI think to request a degree instead of looking at real world experience for a job is completely pointless.\n\nCMV.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But you misplace your blame: it's not competition that's at fault, it's distribution. Competition entails that you have an *opportunity* (ideally, an equal opportunity) to get coveted thing x. Access to food, medicine, education in our world today is determined by *distribution*. i.e., it's not that starving children in Ethiopia lose the competition for food - it's that they're never given the chance to compete for food because of a complex network of political and economic factors that make disposing of food surpluses a more beneficial decision than distributing those food surpluses in famine-struck regions. Consider also the 30s famine in Ukraine. At the time, Ukraine was already part of the USSR - so competition wasn't a thing. However, they still starved, despite not having to compete for food, because that food was taken away and distributed elsewhere. You have to be given access to a resource before you can compete for it.\n\nToday, the biggest problem is access, not competitiveness. Realistically, the majority of the world's population is barred from competing for education, health, food, etc. simply because they weren't born in a developed country. We can further parse the group of people who are allowed to compete for resources along gender and racial lines. That's why we have welfare, affirmative action, and other support programs: to encourage *fair* competition.\n\nIf you recall, the constitution doesn't say that every man is entitled to his happiness.

I would agree that it is essential. However, there is always a division between liberty and security.  If a government has access to all information, they can, in theory, keep you perfectly safe from threats.  However, a government that collects all information has a huge danger of becoming too powerful. \n\nFood: What quality of food should everyone get? Should everyone get minimum standards of barely edible, unhealthy food at low cost? Should people get amazing food that not only tastes great, but is healthy at a very high cost? Who determines this?\n\nShelter: Same argument as with everywhere else. What minimum standard should we set?\n\nCompetition is necessary, and is not the opposite of cooperation, even though it may sound like it.  In an idealistic society, a person competes with another person, not to hurt the other person, but to help themselves.  If, for example, there are two teachers who want to teach in a school, but the school only needs one, the better teacher gets the job. This is better for the students in the classroom than it would be if the better teacher did not apply and decide to compete with the worse teacher.  It IS worse for the teacher who didn't do as good of a job, but it's hard to make the argument that the person who is in charge of the school is greedy.\n\n\n\n&gt;i still think there is a system of government out there, somewhere that is just perfect and we're gonna find it someday.\n\nTheoretically, the perfect government provides everything its citizens want without taking away people's freedoms. Unfortunately, there isn't an unlimited amount of stuff in the world. "}, {"id": "cmx8crs", "body": "No idea why you got downvoted. This pretty much identifies the problem.

He was track star in his high school andncollege days as well as a basketball star.\n\nHowever, his stats are not what point to him being a great athlete. For one, Wilt was a major, major, MAJOR stat chaser. He would essentially ease up on defense to preserve his \"never fouled out\" record when he got in foul trouble, and in his 100 point game especially, his teammates completely stopped trying to score and just fed him the ball on every possession, and the opposing team also fouled him repeatedly to try and stop him. He didn't get there solely through his athletic ability. And while I don't see how assists correlate to athleticism, he only led that season because he wanted to prove he could and focused on it. That's why he only did it once.\n\nIn addition, the other half of the older era argument is they played at a ridiculously faster pace, and the average shooter was worse then than it is today. Increased possession plus increased missed shots made it laughably easy for a guy like Wilt, who had a height advantage over the majority of players (yes, he played with Russell and other HOFers. They were not a majority of the league), to rebound and score at ridiculous numbers.\n\nWilt is an incredible athlete, yeah, but it seems to me your argument is mainly trying to paint him as the greatest basketball player ever (which, in my opinion, is impossible to prove because you can't really compare eras, for a multitude of reasons) rather than the greatest athlete ever. Plenty of people are athletic. Hakeem Olajuwon was a 7-footer but one of the quickest and agile players who ever played. Shaq was also incredibly agile for a man his size yet maintained an incredible level of strength, and I don't think I need to mention guys like Jordan and Lebron. If you have some other standard of athleticism besides NBA stats, I'd like to hear them, but otherwise you haven't really defended Wilt as the greatest athlete ever."}]}
