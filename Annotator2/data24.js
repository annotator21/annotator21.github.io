All of a sudden, a large number of people who (a) know nothing about a certain issue and (b) don't particularly care about it are suddenly the deciding factor in how that issue is addressed. Previously, they would have based their votes on other factors, so their non-opinions about these issues would have little effect. Now they have a huge effect.\n\nTo elaborate on what I mean by \"non-opinions\": political scientists have found that most people, on most issues, don't have strong, stable opinions. In fact, seemingly irrelevant changes to how a poll is conducted (the specific wording of the question, the order the questions are asked) have *enormous* effects on how people respond, indicating that a large number of respondents don't feel strongly about the issue at all.

MSM stands for men who have sex with men. \n\n\"Although MSM represent about 4% of the male population in the United States, in 2010, MSM accounted for 78% of new HIV infections among males and 63% of all new infections.\"\n\n\"More than 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV infection, and almost 1 in 7 (14%) are unaware of their infection.\"\n\n\"Today, the false negative rate in the general U.S. population is around 0.003%, or three times out of every 100,000 tests.\"\n\nIt just seems like the risk of letting MSM donate blood is not worth whatever sort of \"civil right\" gay men believe it to be. I am a gay man myself, and I don't feel oppressed just because I can't donate blood. I know that I am part of a demographic that is highly at risk for HIV infection, and it's not like being a MSM is the only condition where you can't donate blood. It doesn't really even have to do with gay men specifically. If you identify as straight, but have had sex with a man once in the past, you can't donate blood. If you are a gay man, but have never had sex with a man, you *can* donate blood. All it has to do with is risk and safety, not civil rights and discrimination. \n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Of course, there's other factors when it comes to policy (have tests improved since this data was taken, have HIV trends changed, are there other alternatives between ban and no-ban, PR, etc.) but my point is that it's not these percentages that ultimately matter when it comes to raw lives."}, {"id": "cmsjs6a", "body": "&gt; Estimated risk is between 1 per 1.4 million and 1 per 1.8 million.

That is the 78% you are talking about. \n\nAccording to [census.gov]( http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf) (PDF) , the male population of the United States was **151,781,326**. If your 4% figure holds true, then the population of people in the US who could be classified as MSM would be roughly **6,071,254**.  That is the 4% you are talking about. \n\nThe population of people with HIV in the US is estimated to be **1,144,500**. The CDC estimates that about 76% of people with HIV are men. That would be about **869,820**. \n\nAdditionally, we know the CDC's definition of Transmission category is \"the multiple risk factors that a person may have had by selecting the one most likely to have resulted in HIV transmission.\" There is not a clear definition of 'sex' a man must engage in to become a MSM on the 2010 fact sheet, or really anywhere readily accessible on the CDC's website. I did find the following definition [elsewhere](http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/app-interpret.htm) :\n\n*\"[MSM] were defined as men who either reported having sex with another man ever before STD testing\u2026or who did not report sex with men but reported that they considered themselves gay/homosexual or bisexual\u2026Men who have sex with women (MSW) were defined as men who reported having sex with women only before STD testing or who did not report the sex of their sex partner, but reported that they considered themselves straight/heterosexual.\"*\n\nSo, the data that we are working with is not only self-reported, but also a best estimate of what is \u2018likely\u2019. According to the [CDC]( http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/substance-abuse.htm), LGBT individuals have a high rate of substance abuse. Additionally, the definition of MSM does not, by definition, necessarily exclude straight or bisexual men. Though perhaps not as possible, sex with women or use of intravenous needles are just as possible. \n\nThat means all we can really say for sure is that between 1 and 869,820 men currently living in the United States who have HIV received it from male-to-male sexual contact. Even so, at most, no more than 14% of the population of United States MSM could have HIV.\n\nHere are the conclusions I make: The definitions and the numbers that organizations use are based on antiquated, stigmatized and flat out inaccurate notions of what queer culture is. It is based more on presumption rather than real numbers and has been manipulated to look inherent to the population.  Amongst people with HIV, the number of MSM is high, but amongst MSM, the number of people diagnosed with HIV is not. \n\nOrganizations that do not accept blood, marrow or organ donations from MSM are preemptively rejecting at least 5,201,434 people for fear that they may be the 869,820. *That* is no small number. *That* is a form of discrimination. \n"}, {"id": "2p078d", "body": "Here are some statistics.

It is a phrase all of us have used or heard, most likely within the past few days. It is a phrase built to end arguments, prevent yelling, and provide a middle ground for those who simply can not agree. There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion, such as preference to chocolate or vanilla, hot or cold, red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion, often dealing with some sort of sensory information(feel taste smell etc.). Unfortunately, the use of \"everyone is entitled to their opinion\" has shifted over time, and is more often than not used in a visceral and spiteful manner. That is when the phrase becomes dangerous. The thought process behind the spiteful and lazy use of that phrase is what allowed cultures (speaking mostly of the US because that is where I am from) to slide away from a collective and productive entity, and into a state of cyclical banter.  My evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows:  \n\n1. People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult, or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance, in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they don't know, and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an \"opinion difference\" in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs.  \n\n2. The idea of being an \"expert\" on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available, individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields(10,000 hours according to the fantastic book \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell) is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate.  \n\n3. Factual arguments that can be argued down to a relative \"truth\" within the context of the argument are no longer explored. Opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various news(propaganda) organizations. The \"Everyone is entitled to their opinion\" mindset is the engine that drives the divide in cultural beliefs. No suitable and rational arguments are being made anymore because an OPINION is something that doesn't need to be changed as everyone is entitled to have one. \n\nThere are many more examples that I will go into if needed.  \n\nEssentially what I am saying is that the idea behind the phrase, and the misuse of the phrase is an underlying cause of many of the political, cultural, and social issues that continue to exist year after year(with many of them getting worse). The idea that everyone has an entitlement when it comes to opinions that affect beliefs is preposterous and dangerous.  \n\nAs a personal conclusion, many of the points I made in the write-up, and many of the points I will make in the comments are in fact hypocritical. I am not innocent in the claims that I am making, so please help me not be as cynical and free me from my hypocrisy.  \n\nCMV!\n\nPS: If any of my points are not clear enough, or are not expanded enough feel free to ask and I will try to better explain them.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is a phrase all of us have used or heard, most likely within the past few days. It is a phrase built to end arguments, prevent yelling, and provide a middle ground for those who simply can not agree. There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion, such as preference to chocolate or vanilla, hot or cold, red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion, often dealing with some sort of sensory information(feel taste smell etc.). Unfortunately, the use of \"everyone is entitled to their opinion\" has shifted over time, and is more often than not used in a visceral and spiteful manner. That is when the phrase becomes dangerous. The thought process behind the spiteful and lazy use of that phrase is what allowed cultures (speaking mostly of the US because that is where I am from) to slide away from a collective and productive entity, and into a state of cyclical banter.  My evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows:  \n\n1. People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult, or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance, in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they don't know, and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an \"opinion difference\" in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs.  \n\n2. The idea of being an \"expert\" on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available, individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields(10,000 hours according to the fantastic book \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell) is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate.  \n\n3. Factual arguments that can be argued down to a relative \"truth\" within the context of the argument are no longer explored. Opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various news(propaganda) organizations. The \"Everyone is entitled to their opinion\" mindset is the engine that drives the divide in cultural beliefs. No suitable and rational arguments are being made anymore because an OPINION is something that doesn't need to be changed as everyone is entitled to have one. \n\nThere are many more examples that I will go into if needed.  \n\nEssentially what I am saying is that the idea behind the phrase, and the misuse of the phrase is an underlying cause of many of the political, cultural, and social issues that continue to exist year after year(with many of them getting worse). The idea that everyone has an entitlement when it comes to opinions that affect beliefs is preposterous and dangerous.  \n\nAs a personal conclusion, many of the points I made in the write-up, and many of the points I will make in the comments are in fact hypocritical. I am not innocent in the claims that I am making, so please help me not be as cynical and free me from my hypocrisy.  \n\nCMV!\n\nPS: If any of my points are not clear enough, or are not expanded enough feel free to ask and I will try to better explain them.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

His association of correctness with experts comes to light. It Is very evident he correlates the strength of an argument with the expertise of the one who made it as he explicitly says that percieved expertise allows us to stengthen our arguments. By doing so, he assumes we all believe in arguments from authority and demonstrates that he does as well. Had he said that we incorrectly assume we are correct because of a perceived expwrtise then that would be fine. But he says that the lay people not correct or are supposedly not abke to have a strong conclusiom while only \"true experts\" are.

This type of fallacy is known as ad hominem. And thus, the idea of \"experts\" as you put it has never been valid.\n\n&gt;This may be a bit pedantic of me, but actually this isn't an ad hominem. Ad hominem is when you claim that an argument is *invalid* because of some trait or characteristic of the person making it. When you claim that an argument is *valid* because of the expertise of the person making it, that's called an \"appeal to authority\" fallacy. Additionally, your entire paragraph is a non sequitor. Simply because the appeal to authority fallacy exists does not mean that the concept of experts is invalid. It just means you shouldn't attempt to justify an argument with \"that's what this guy said, and he's super smart!\".\n\nI will attempt to address all of this by readdressing the OP and more importantly the Intent of the OP.\n\nHad the OP stated that it is no longer valid that people are CONSIDERED experts because information is so readily accessible then I would have responded differently. \n\n&gt;2. The idea of being an \"expert\" on a topic is no longer valid.\n\nNote that I also used the term expert in quotations in my response as I believe OP is confusing being an expert with accepting an argument because someone is an expert. From OP's post it is very evident he intends the latter. \n\n&gt;It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available, individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. \n\nSo OP states that people, despite being researched on a topic, are incorrectly assuming they are correct about some things in that topic.\n\nThere are 2 fallacies here: that having spent more time on the topic makes a conclusion more likely correct (this is precisely an a argument from authority) and that people despite being researched are unable to form a correct conclusion or a valid conclusion  (the ad hominem I was previously referring to).\n\n&gt;The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields(10,000 hours according to the fantastic book \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell) is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate.\n\n This it where it's is very evident of OP's opinion. His association of correctness with experts comes to light. It Is very evident he correlates the strength of an argument with the expertise of the one who made it as he explicitly says that percieved expertise allows us to stengthen our arguments. By doing so, he assumes we all believe in arguments from authority and demonstrates that he does as well. Had he said that we incorrectly assume we are correct because of a perceived expwrtise then that would be fine. But he says that the lay people not correct or are supposedly not abke to have a strong conclusiom while only \"true experts\" are.

Is it EVEN APPLICABLE to use probability when judging the accuracy of experts (ie. if the topic asked to an expert and third party is SELECTED specifically by a third part is that topic still sufficiently random that it is truly \"probability?)? I think you're missing this point which is why the ecological fallacy applies. If I asked you to go to a grocery store close your eyes and walk until you bump into someone, will the % chance that you bump into a male or a female be exactly equal to the distribution of male/female people in your country? A more redundant example: The # of males/females in the world is approximately 50/50%. There exists a subset of peoples within the total set of all peoples such that every person in this subset is a male person. What is the probability of selecting a female in this subset? By CHOOSING specifically the question you ask, you bias the test and make \"probability\" a lot irrelevant an argument.

It is a phrase all of us have used or heard, most likely within the past few days. It is a phrase built to end arguments, prevent yelling, and provide a middle ground for those who simply can not agree. There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion, such as preference to chocolate or vanilla, hot or cold, red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion, often dealing with some sort of sensory information(feel taste smell etc.). Unfortunately, the use of \"everyone is entitled to their opinion\" has shifted over time, and is more often than not used in a visceral and spiteful manner. That is when the phrase becomes dangerous. The thought process behind the spiteful and lazy use of that phrase is what allowed cultures (speaking mostly of the US because that is where I am from) to slide away from a collective and productive entity, and into a state of cyclical banter.  My evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows:  \n\n1. People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult, or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance, in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they don't know, and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an \"opinion difference\" in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs.  \n\n2. The idea of being an \"expert\" on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available, individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields(10,000 hours according to the fantastic book \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell) is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate.  \n\n3. Factual arguments that can be argued down to a relative \"truth\" within the context of the argument are no longer explored. Opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various news(propaganda) organizations. The \"Everyone is entitled to their opinion\" mindset is the engine that drives the divide in cultural beliefs. No suitable and rational arguments are being made anymore because an OPINION is something that doesn't need to be changed as everyone is entitled to have one. \n\nThere are many more examples that I will go into if needed.  \n\nEssentially what I am saying is that the idea behind the phrase, and the misuse of the phrase is an underlying cause of many of the political, cultural, and social issues that continue to exist year after year(with many of them getting worse). The idea that everyone has an entitlement when it comes to opinions that affect beliefs is preposterous and dangerous.  \n\nAs a personal conclusion, many of the points I made in the write-up, and many of the points I will make in the comments are in fact hypocritical.

There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion, such as preference to chocolate or vanilla, hot or cold, red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion, often dealing with some sort of sensory information(feel taste smell etc.).

My evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows:  \n\n1. People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult, or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance, in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they don't know, and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an \"opinion difference\" in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs.  \n\n2. The idea of being an \"expert\" on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available, individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic.

It\u2019s the political correctness mis-interpreted and then taken to another level in it that\u2019s dangerous.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having even the most ridiculous beliefs; that is our right, but expecting others to abide by them and, what is far more serious in consequences, treat them as equally valid within a context of a rational and evidence-based discourse, is what makes it dangerous. Within the western so-called \u2018civilisation\u2019, whose value system is coincidentally based to a great degree on monotheistic religions, which assume absolute obedience rather than independent thinking and challenge, it\u2019s very often rather difficult to separate the individual\u2019s sense of identity from the their frame of beliefs, and since beliefs are, by definition, an expression of certain hopes and expectations, and not requiring to be verified or validated, any challenge to the beliefs, with their vagueness irrelevant, becomes a challenge to the individual\u2019s very identity and integrity. We\u2019re just not used to challenging our own beliefs, or to others challenging them, and tend to identify with them as if they were us.\n\nEastern philosophies, like Taoism or Buddhism (and I\u2019m deliberately not using the word \u2018religion\u2019 here, because religions they are not), deal with the matter in a far more coherent way, but adopting them requires a significant shift in values and a rather radical move from a rather arrogant, ego-centric, often lazy and selfish mentality of an individual who is being persuaded from birth that they\u2019re separate from what is outside their skin, towards the holistic and more relation-based\u2014and relation-aware\u2014one, which assumes responsibility not only for oneself but for the whole of the surrounding environment and others as well, which tends to be harder and require much more effort, especially the mental one (and which\u2014quelle surprise!\u2014sells less stuff, undermining the very idea of progress as defined in capitalism).\n\nI would agree with Ramazotti, who has commented below:\n\n&gt;You are only entitled to what you can argue for,\n\nwhich is itself a quote taken from: [No, you\u2019re not entitled to your opinion](http://theconversation.com/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978)\u2014a surprisingly short and simple analysis of the problem.\n\nA very interesting aspect of the whole problem is the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect ([Dunning\u2013Kruger effect] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)), which basically relates to the ignorance not being able to recognize, by definition, its own degree and therefore assuming, arrogantly, the appearances of validity and competence, and attempting to act accordingly."}, {"id": "2p04r0", "body": "My argument may come of as pretentious, but I will do my best to present my view in a valid and logical way.\n\n\"Everyone is entitled to their opinion\".

However, \"truth\" is a very slippery concept and opinion is just as valid an argument when considering a moral stance or societal imperative. \n\n1) You can be right, some people use the phrase to cover ignorance. Though while you may not agree with someone's stance on something it doesn't immediately mean you are correct...or wrong. There *are* massive grey areas in our world, in our logic, our moralities, our attitudes, etc. Certainly I wish to mold people to my way of thinking also, but while I may not like their views I recognize they have a right to have them. I do draw a hard line at ignorance however. If someone has an informed opinion, and can articulate it (assuming I am informed as well), we can discuss a topic. \n\n2) The more I have learned, the harder it is for me to be *sure* about almost anything. I have been asked for my professional expertise in my field of study. I have written academic and professional reports, and have done so with the knowledge that I *can't* know everything. Things change, new information becomes available, and what was important one day may be less so in the future. Not to sound pretentious, but \"The more I learn, the more I learn how little I know\"(Socrates), seems relevant. There are academics who are at the top of their respective fields who disagree by as little as degrees or as much as foundation. \n\n3) Your best point in my...opinion. Ignorance is excusable, but willful ignorance is not. People who ignore history, scientific discovery, or social injustices simply to suit their view of what the *want* to be true, for whatever reason, should be exposed and ridiculed. Propaganda can be used for good, but at what cost? Breaking faith with the people you hope to educate can bite you or them in the end. The ends rarely justify the means. Our current political climate is not an isolated event historically, but the last time this ind of division was instigated was during McCarthyism. \n\nFinally, not everyone is going to agree. Yet, stifling disagreement can be detrimental. Rarely is there a one \"truth\", at best you have several perspectives. While it may cause consternation, \"everyone's entitled to their own opinion\" *is* important for everyone. At least that's one man's opinion.

But opinions don't trump facts.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the first statement. The issue comes when people ignore the importance of the second half.\n\nSo my argument is essentially: I agree with everything you're saying is a result, but I disagree with the cause. I don't think it's the idea that everyone is entitled to their opinion that's causing the problem. I think it's people not acknowledging that some opinions are just factually wrong. Just because someone has an opinion doesn't mean that opinion has any merit. The issue doesn't come from everyone having their own opinion, but the over-significance we have placed on opinions in general. \n\nI think this also matches up with some great points other's have said in the thread which point out how the idea \"everyone is entitled to their own opinion\" can actually have some really beneficial side effects and that it doesn't seem to be the root of the issue you're noticing. To reference what /u/TheSilverFin said, it can encourage people to speak up and say things in situations where they previously may have discouraged from voicing their opinions. That's great! Having a wide array of voices and hearing from more people is a great thing. Using that example, I think the issue comes when we get a little ADHD about opinions. We stop being able to differentiate useless or dsitracting stimulus from useful and important. It just blurs and becomes overwhelming noise. If everyone is speaking their voice, you have a whole lot of people talking at once. And not everyone is going to know what they're talking about. We shouldn't silence those people. But we also shouldn't put those people alongside experts or people more educated on the subject and say all their opinions are equal. This is also why we're seeing an explosion of this as we get more and more voices. More TV stations, more blogs, more sites, More and more stimulus which has just exacerbated this effect. \n\nhttp://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/12/kenny-smith-charles-barkley-ferguson-open-letter-exclusive\nThis is a reply by a coworker of Charles Barkley about some remarks he made about Ferguson. The part that's relevant is the letter talks about how the amount of weight given to Charles Barkley's statements do not match with how qualified he is to make statements on the issue. It isn't that Charles Barkley has an opinion, or even that he's stating them. Who didn't have some sort of opinion to Ferguson? The issue was coming from how people reacted to Charles Barkley's opinions. Mainly, they acted like they were something other than the musings of an ex-pro athlete. The level of importance that was misplaced was the source of the issue.\n\nEveryone is entitle to their opinion. But some opinions are more informed than others, and sometimes opinion isn't relevant at all. So while everyone should be encouraged to have an opinion, I think the problem occurs when we treat all opinions equally. If someone is saying \"we're all entitled to our opinion\" in a fight, they're almost certainly saying \"screw this. let's just both be right and stop talking about it.\". Which you're right, doesn't lead to any big moments of growth. But it also kind of sounds like exactly what I would say to a family member or someone I don't see the point in arguing with. Because it's also a \"fuck you, I know my opinion is the right one and yours is wrong. But let's drop it. (But I know I'm right)\". \n\nWhen you're \"right\", this is because you know you're right. The other person is just clearly wrong. If someone tells me that the world is 6,000 years old, I'm just like \"Yeah, no, it's not. You're absolutely wrong and I'm absolutely right.\" But rather than argue with them, I'll be like \"whatever. Believe your weird beliefs I think are hooplah. It's not worth it to me to argue this.\"\n\nThe issue is that people think they're absolutely right way more often than they actually are. I think I'm absolutely right about most things. So when someone tells us we're wrong, we instinctively shut down into that \"No, trust me, YOU'RE the moron here\" mode.\n\n But while I agree this is a bad thing that happens, I don't think it has anything to do with the phrase or concept \"everyone is entitled to their opinion\". I think this is just the natural human bias that most people have that we belief we're right more than we are. Everyone always thinks they're fighting for the right side, that people should side with them in an argument, etc. After all, the very act of being on one side of an argument almost always implies that in your reality, your side is the \"right\" side. \n\nThe issue worsens when people not only shut down other people's opinions, they shut down information which holds more significance their opinion. We have a natural bias to ignore things which don't fit within our definition of reality and we dislike cognitive dissonance, so when it comes back we usually just choose to ignore the unpleasantness of it all. We ignore our own hypocrisies. Totally normal. But again, these problems have little to do with the idea \"everyone is entitled to their own opinion. And I agree, I think that's actually a really great concept that encourages people to think about things and form opinions."}, {"id": "2p04r0", "body": "My argument may come of as pretentious, but I will do my best to present my view in a valid and logical way.\n\n\"Everyone is entitled to their opinion\".

Because what you are saying in the title makes no sense. The phrase \"everyone is entitled to their opinion\" is in fact just an opinion. One that only some people believe. Usually these are very intelligent but naive people.\n\nIn reality, everyone is bound by the rule of law and social pressures to behave certain ways and believe certain things. Most people from birth are obligated to believe certain things or face ostracizing and ridicule from their whole community. Whether that be matters of religion, orientation, race, politics, or socio-economic status, many people in the world are not given an option as to what they believe reality to be.\n\nAs far as politics are concerned, and how it applies there, you will find again that if you look beyond what everyone claims their differences are, you will find several key distinction that bond everyone in government together. Things that no one is allowed not to believe. Like capitalism, Christianity, a whitewashed view of America's past, heteronormative/patriarchal ideals, loyalty to oil companies/lobbyists, social security, medicaid, taxation, foreign policy, monetary policy, pro-Federal reserve, pro-AARP. For Republicans there are certain things you must believe. Same goes for democrats.\n\nMaybe the fact is that you believe you are right about most things? If you keep a more open mind and listen to people's opinions and how they support them, you'll find that many people are intolerant of other's opinions, except for those that support their opinions with facts.

But that doesn't mean that a) those women are in the wrong, or b) that you should demean those women or try to silence them.\n\n1. I doubt any of us have such an excellent handle on reality that we always know exactly why something is happening. We've all been influenced by education, life experience, social interaction, ad infinitum - and those things form the basis of how we interpret reality. For instance, somebody who's been mugged by a stranger in a dark alley might run away screaming from a stranger in a dark alley, even though that stranger is perfectly harmless. Somebody who was bullied for their weight in school might go through life believing that people don't like them because they're fat, even though they might just be a shitty person. Are they misunderstanding the situation because of their biases? Sure. But don't we all do that?\n\n2. It's of course possible to overreact to stimuli, but you wouldn't know if a person is overreacting unless you know what their reaction should be. Imagine your Latina colleague has a peanut allergy and you don't. She accidentally eats a bit of peanut butter and seizes up. You're like, wtf, it's just peanut butter, get yourself together woman - because to you, the normal reaction to eating peanut butter is, whatever. But to her, a normal reaction to eating peanut butter is a painful and sudden death. It would be silly in this case to say that she's overreacting compared to you, because her situation is not like yours. You would be wrong in gauging the appropriateness of her reaction unless you knew that she has a peanut allergy.

If you look at all of the popular sports in the U.S. they are all easily quantifiable.  As Americans we like numbers. We like to put things in boxes. We like to make comparisons. \n\nYou look at a single play in Football. It lasts what, 5 seconds? 8 seconds? But look at all the glorious data you can cull from that amount of time. You've got blocks, tackles, throws, runs, all kinds of things that happen in that period that can be put into boxes. \n\nDid he move the ball? Yes or no. Did he make positive or negative yards? How many yards? Did he get a first down? Did he score? How far did he punt the ball? etc. etc. etc.\n\nAll of our popular sports follow that.  Basketball is fast moving and can be non-stop like soccer, but it's broken into easily managed and counted segments of time with the shot clock. Rebounds, assists, penalties, free throws, etc. etc. etc.\n\nNascar is all about speed, laps, passing, pit time.\n\nGolf is all about par, putt distance, drive distance.\n\nTennis is all about speed of serve, length of volley, scoring points.\n\nBaseball is...I mean, the game is essentially a super complicated math problem at this point, heh.\n\n\nThe cynic can say that these games also provide easy pauses to throw commercial breaks in to, but I think at it's heart these sports allow us to break everything that happens into easily digestible stats.\n\nSoccer, however, doesn't do that. You can't quantify a good play because it just. keeps. happening.  There's no pause, there's no \"play\" to value.  How do you put into a number a player's ability to keep the ball away from a defender? In football you can, the quarterback had X seconds in the pocket because of his offensive line. How do you put into a statistic a person's ability to kick the ball away to give his teammates a quick breather? \n\nYou look at most Americans argument against Soccer and it has to do with the fact that you can not put the game into boxes. \"Oh there's no scoring, it's so boring, nothing happens.\"  Anyone that's an avid fan of soccer ~knows~ that things are happening, that there are a number of amazing subtleties that go into these people playing this game. You just...you just can't put it into a quick box. \"Messi is able to control the ball and it keep it in his possession for over 30 seconds against 2 defenders 73% of time\" Yeah, no. Not going to work.\n\nI think that's why it has a hard time catching on in America.  It's not that things don't happen, as I see a number of people in the thread argue, it's that the way that things happen operates so differently from all of the other popular sports.

The debate of soccer by the mainstream media here in the US makes us *talk about soccer*, which is step number one.  Guess what happens when we don't talk about soccer?  We *forget* about it.  That's worse.  \n\nWe Americans fucking *love* 24/7 meta conversations and debates about our sports, which some find really weird.  The NFL offseason was nothing but discussion about player conduct and some bad off the field incidents - but we ate it up and couldn't wait for the NFL season start.\n\nSoccer fans aren't ostracized from what I've seen in the US... the little discussion that pop up from time to time are mostly an opportunity for soccer fans to evangelize about the sport they love.  It's good for the sport.\n\nAs far as some of your specific points:\n\n&gt; I believe the veiled snobbiness and general condescension from Euro football fans has contributed to this\n\nIt's not veiled, it's blatant.  Nothing is more irritating when a soccer fan says \"the rest of the world loves soccer\".  It's only true if by \"rest of the world\" they mean \"Europe, South America, and a couple parts of Africa\".  India, SE Asia, North America, and Australia care about soccer about the same amount - not much.\n\nIt's a little bit of a turn off, but not really the problem.\n\n&gt; How is the average American supposed to casually follow the Premier League, if they are constantly being told to line up on a side and either be a full blooded Hooligan or a HandEgg Loyalist? Casualism is the backbone of football.\n\nThe better question is how is the average American supposed to casually follow the Premier League, when it's played in the UK?  You need to watch sports on live TV, and preferably as a spectator.  There's a lot of local pride with sports - your team is your city/state/country... you're born into it, like a religion.  Sorry, but I have no emotional steak in a match between Manchester and Leeds, nor do I care to watch it live at 2 AM.  Sorry.\n\nKnow how the NFL is trying to promote itself in the UK?  By *playing some fucking games* in London.  That helps.  Shipping the occasional washed-up Euro star like Beckham to our joke of a league isn't going to get us watching - we (naturally) want to watch the best.  \n\n&gt;  It's a slow process, no-one transitions from knows-nothing to uberfan in a year. I believe a true love for a sport comes from following a team for a long period of time... Casualism is the backbone of football.\n\nCasual fans watch a sport because their friends watch, or because their local team is good, or because an event gets hyped up in the media.  For the US, that happens in the World Cup... and that's it.\n\nThe US has a surprisingly competitive team, given our relative apathy to the sport at the professional level. We've recently started get psyched every four years.\n\nThe Cup is the best way to promote soccer in the US, but FIFA seems pretty happy shafting the US by putting us in the toughest division, more recently constantly awarding the cup to locations that make live viewership tough from US timezones... Brazil this year and the US (20 years ago) the only ones in this hemisphere in my lifetime.  Whereas every other World Cup has been in Europe.\n\n--\n\n\nAll of that said, a lot of your post seems to insinuate that Americas would just love soccer if we only watched it and stopped talking about it.\n\nIt's like you believe soccer is *objectively* the best and most exciting sport on the planet, which just isn't correct.  Soccer's popularity is in a large part due to history and inertia... and in a region without it, it shouldn't be surprising that it has to compete with sports that might just be *more fun* to watch in a vacuum.\n\n"}, {"id": "2ozfba", "body": "[I realise the entire premise for this post is completely hypocritical.

Yes I will call it football, and yes I know soccer is an English word. I could not care less about the name of the sport, it makes exactly 0 difference to my enjoyment]\n\nHello CMV,\n\nI am of the opinion that the constant stream of debate on the positives/negatives of Association Football as a sport have been the biggest driver behind American's apathy towards the sport.\n\nNothing is worse than being told how weird or unusual you are for not liking a commonly popular thing, or being told that something is wrong with you if you don't. The American sporting fanbase has had to deal with a lot of this over the past 50 odd years with regards to football, and although this has slightly waned over ~ the past 2 World Cups, I believe it is too late, and will now never be fully ingratiated into US sporting culture (compared to the classic sports).\n\nI believe the veiled snobbiness and general condescension from Euro football fans has contributed to this, but I also believe that the internet has created a 'Debate All Ad Nauseum' ethos which can be counterproductive to the growth of traditional hobbies/games/sports in a modern setting.\n\nSo many articles like ['Why America Doesn\u2019t Like Soccer, And How That Can Be Changed' - Time Magazine](http://time.com/2864483/world-cup-2014-soccer-brazil-america/), [Is This Soccer's Moment in America? - WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/is-this-soccers-moment-in-america-1403819659), and [Forget the World Cup Hype. America Will Never Embrace Soccer - LA Weekly](http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2014/06/30/forget-the-world-cup-hype-america-will-never-embrace-soccer) hinder a natural growth of interest in the history and traditions of football, which is a fundamental reason why the game is so popular. Who wants to be fed full of 'This could be popular because x viewer stats and # of tweets per minute of the game', and then go look at Liverpool's success in the 80's? Nobody.\n\nAnother reason is emotion. Being told to 'pick a side, pro football or anti football' creates an aura of national debate usually saved for Politics or Religion. Tarring a sport with this brush is a bad move, and does not help a casual fan from gradually falling in love with the game. It's a slow process, no-one transitions from knows-nothing to uberfan in a year.
