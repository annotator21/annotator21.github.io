The vast majority of police forces are local.  They are generally not working extensively with each other.  The \"police\" is not a monolithic entity that can just roll in and establish martial law.

She is still expressing that she is an individual in this contemporary society that can form an opinion on this topic.\n\nPerhaps. But she doesn't have to. She can argue a point that goes completely against her upbringing, purely to develop her persuasive skills, which is the point of the assignment. \n\nYou seem to say that using language itself is self expression. You may be right, but I can't think of an instance in school where students are forced to use language without: 1. it being self expression, and also not right; 2. being able to express an idea that the student doesn't hold, and thus arguably not actually self-expression. Or put it another way, convince me that school forces us to use language in a way that I can't argue it's not self expression, and that I don't think it's wrong. \n\n&gt;That's true, but if you don't want to express yourself, what is the fucking point of learning an instrument?!\n\nWhat's the point of learning calculus if you want to be a social worker? Learning a skill such as calculus or playing an instrument may help a student learn another skill such as analytic thinking or self-discipline. But to answer your question directly, the students can also play to themselves the music that they like, in their own time. \n\n&gt;There's almost no point to teaching music other than to engage students in expressing themselves through the music.\n\nThis is the central issue for me. What if some students don't WANT to \"engage in expressing themselves through music\"? How can you feel justified in FORCING them to? How is it even possible to force them? Won't the \"music\" that comes out of them under those circumstances be corrupted by the coercion? I guess an analogy could be made to torture, not that I'm saying art class is literally torture. Under torture, the victim would be willing to do anything, say anything to stop the torture, and so the information that comes out of them is unreliable. When coerced to express oneself through art or music, the student won't care about the actual art or music. They only care about getting the assignment done so they won't fail. Thus, I'm arguing that the end result isn't genuine art, and so forcing students to create art defeats its own purpose. \n\n&gt;Music isn't about playing scales and never missing a note, it's about creating your own vision of the piece, and then communicating that to the audience in an engaging way.\n\nI find it enjoyable to just learn to recreate a piece of music, no creativity or audience needed. \n\n&gt;All other lines of discussion aside, I am most interested in why you hold this view. Why do you think getting students to express themselves is bad?\n\nI hope I've addressed that above? \n\n&gt;I see it as absolutely necessary for success in an adult working life, and thus ought to be a part of public schooling.\n\nYes, I agree that self expression is necessary for success, but a student can learn how to express himself without being forced to express himself.

So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies?

Increasing wellfare and social programs (like free daycare etc) to help equalize things is always fair, because no matter what parents situation is, no one should suffer just because they are poor. Making man pay for child support doesn't magically fix anything, it just puts all responsibility on one man who might barely support himself, and the kid will still have a shitty life.\n\nSo yes, in any case I would support this even regardless of this specific issue.\n\nI am not sure about how to legaly ensure financial abortion, but I can definitely say that from a strictly moral perspective, it is wrong for a woman to make a choice and make man pay for it. In the meanwhile, there can at least be some saner expectations on how much that support should be. \n\nUnfortunately this is something that should be basic human decency, and I would even suggest an asumption that the man is opted out unless he chooses to opt in- since there doesn't need to be a legal issue in the first place with those who'd opt in, and I can assume it is then always known to a woman, while it is safe to assume that otherwise there was no consent to having a child. \n\nI think that if there was no consent to having a child, a woman should always think with the assumption that she might have to care for it alone and support it alone, and if she can't do that it is common sense to abort. \n\n\ni would also propose longer time to allow abortion, free abortions, and more places and programs to make it easier.

So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies? Is this something we as a society feel is an acceptable result?\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Financial abortion is completely unworkable, bad public policy, and very unlikely to be morally supported by society.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmr4ci3", "body": "This seems so easy to answer I can't believe I'm the first to do so.  \n\nYou've proposed so many situations in which the woman misbehaves or lies I'm not going to try and summarize them all but there is a simple answer.  \n\nIf the woman acts in some way which prevents the man from doing his part in filing the paperwork then he has the option to complete said paperwork once the deception is revealed. This is fair to both parties since the man is already expected to act within a time frame or forfeit his right, the woman should be required to do the same.\n\nWhile I do think the taxpayer burden could be increased, I think it's more likely to be reduced.\n\nHow much money is spent to prosecute or imprison men who don't pay support?\n\nHow many more women would opt for an abortion knowing they can't rely on stealing someones income for 18 years to pay for their decision? The reduced cost to taxpayers for medical support and other benefits would surely be substantial.\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2oubfh", "body": "IMHO, male persons do not have equal rights as female persons in this particular case.\n\n\nA male - let's call him Peter - wants to avoid pregnancy - wearing a condom is a\u00a0quite effective way to do that.

Balancing risk is not something that is the job of the law.  Risks are often unevenly divided.  A casino takes a smaller risk than you do when you play roulette, but if you lose at roulette they still get your money.  There's no moral reason you should be able to use a lack of fairness with regard to risk to get out of the negative consequences of your decision to play the game.  \n\nAdditionally, although parity may sound good as a talking point, it has some really disturbing implications.  For instance, a desire to see risk divided evenly implies that there should be some legal imposition of the negative side-effects of pregnancy or abortion for females on males.  The pregnancy-related risks of sex are certainly unequal: females take on the risk of physical complications up to and including death when having sex, even protected sex, because protection sometimes fails and neither pregnancy nor abortion are risk free.  Say that protected sex has a (to choose an arbitrary number) 1/1,000,000 chance of leading to the female's death, would the government be right to run males through a random number generator each time they have protected sex and kill them if it says they're unlucky?  That would balance the risk.  It would have all kinds of problematic outcomes, but it would balance the risks.  I imagine that you don't like this idea, but I'd ask you what separates physical risks from financial ones?

The remains of the baby are deposited in a jar for disposal.\nWhen used at 13-19 weeks, it is often necessary to use other instruments to remove or crush parts of the baby that are too large to pass through the tube.\"\n\n\"Abortion by hysterotomy\n\nThis abortion procedure (although comparatively rare) is essentially the same as a caesarian section birth: the mother's abdomen is cut open and the child - typically still alive - is removed from the womb.\"\n\n\"Prostaglandin\n\nAn alternative (more expensive) late abortion drug is prostaglandin. It is not free of dangers to the mother, being associated with risks of haemorrhage, infection and retention of the placenta requiring surgical intervention. Prostaglandin causes powerful contractions of the womb expelling the fetus, and usually killing him or her in the process, although in some instances babies have been delivered alive as a result. In later abortions, doctors inject a further drug (such as the poison urea) into the womb, to ensure that the baby does not survive.\"\n\nNot only is it that inhumane, but the mother is also mentally scarred even in some cases where she decided to do it herself, let alone when she was pushed to by the idea of not being able to care for.\nAnd really you think someone cares as little as you for their kid regularly? To even find the idea of giving it away feasible?"}, {"id": "cmtno1p", "body": "I agree that giving the child away is not fair to the child.

My view:\n\n--The cops had a job to do. They had to arrest Garner. They had probable cause. To arrest him, they had to restrain him. Garner had been arrested 30 times before. He knows the routine. He was going to get cuffed, one way or another. If you know the police want to cuff you, and you aggressively resist the officers have no choice but to restrain you, somehow.\n\n--I don't see a chokehold in the video. I see a headlock. When several cops are restraining a very big, angry, aggressive guy, a headlock is absolutely necessary. If you don't restrain the head during the takedown, you're endangering your fellow officers.\n\n--If it were a chokehold, Garner would have lost consciousness and gone limp within a few seconds. That doesn't happen.\n\n--If it were a chokehold, one forearm would have been clamped hard across Garner's throat. The cop's other hand would have been pushing Garner's head down toward his chest. That cuts off blood supply to the brain, which is why it causes unconsciousness so quickly.\n\n--Some commentators have said that the cop cruelly pushes Garner's head into the sidewalk. I'm not sure it is cruel, but I can see the officer pushing Garner's head down until they get the cuffs on him. As soon as the cuffs are on, the cop releases the head. I was a high school wrestler. One of the first things a wrestler learns is that if you control the head, you control the rest of the body. The officer is merely doing his job, restraining and controlling Garner until the other officers get the cuffs on.\n\n--In years past, the officers would have whacked Garner with their clubs, shot him with a taser, or maced him. Because these methods sometimes cause deaths or injuries and are sometimes regarded as cruel, the officers preferred to restrain him physically, which might be less harmful to the suspect, if multiple officers cooperate in the takedown.\n\n--It's true that Garner was unarmed. He wasn't a threat to the lives of the officers. In this situation, however, officers are very concerned about the risk twisted knees, low back injuries, and that sort of thing. With a very large, aggressive suspect, this is a serious concern. Injuries like that end police careers all the time, because police officers often have to restrain combative suspects like Garner.\n\n--Garner is saying or yelling, \"I can't breathe!\" The police union has pointed out, correctly, that if you can talk or shout, you are, in fact breathing. It's not quite clear why he is yelling, \"I can't breathe.\" He continues to say it after the headlock is released, after he is cuffed, and after the cops roll him on his side.\n\n--It is dangerous for a big, heavy man to be cuffed and left face-down. The officers know that and properly roll him on his side. He continues to say, \"I can't breathe,\" possibly because he is having an asthma attack. The officers properly called for an ambulance right away. Police officers don't know how to diagnose and treat asthma, and Garner has been so aggressive and resistive that removing Garner's cuffs would endanger the officers.\n\n--Garner died of a cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. A bad asthma attack can cause a cardiac arrest.\n\n--The coroner's report states that Garner's windpipe was not injured and his hyoid bone was not broken. (The hyoid bone is usually broken when people are strangled to death.)\n\n--It is not clear why Garner suffered a cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. However, he was grossly obese, a heavy smoker, he had evidence of heart disease, and he had asthma. The coroner's report notes all of these contributing factors. A vigorous struggle with several officers might have been enough to trigger a cardiac arrest. Running up a few flights of stairs could have had exactly the same effect on Garner.\n\n--The coroner's report states that homicide was the cause of death. This can be misunderstood. Homicide only means that the actions of one person caused another person to die. If a dangerous intruder breaks into my home and I shoot him in self defense, I have also committed \"homicide.\" Homicide is often misunderstood as \"murder,\" but it isn't.\n\n--The coroner's report is somewhat ambiguous and I have not seen an adequate explanation of it. The coroner says death was caused by \"compression of the neck,\" yet the windpipe was undamaged, the hyoid bone was not broken, and Garner remained conscious until some time after he entered the ambulance.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Again, the trumped up charge was evading less than **one dollar** in taxes. \n"}, {"id": "2ou88n", "body": "My opinions are based on 1-multiple views of the video, shot by a bystander (easily found on youtube and other sources): 2-The wikipedia article, and; 3-Press accounts of the coroner's report. My view:\n\n--The cops had a job to do. They had to arrest Garner. They had probable cause. To arrest him, they had to restrain him. Garner had been arrested 30 times before. He knows the routine. He was going to get cuffed, one way or another. If you know the police want to cuff you, and you aggressively resist the officers have no choice but to restrain you, somehow.\n\n--I don't see a chokehold in the video. I see a headlock. When several cops are restraining a very big, angry, aggressive guy, a headlock is absolutely necessary. If you don't restrain the head during the takedown, you're endangering your fellow officers.\n\n--If it were a chokehold, Garner would have lost consciousness and gone limp within a few seconds. That doesn't happen.\n\n--If it were a chokehold, one forearm would have been clamped hard across Garner's throat. The cop's other hand would have been pushing Garner's head down toward his chest. That cuts off blood supply to the brain, which is why it causes unconsciousness so quickly.\n\n--Some commentators have said that the cop cruelly pushes Garner's head into the sidewalk. I'm not sure it is cruel, but I can see the officer pushing Garner's head down until they get the cuffs on him. As soon as the cuffs are on, the cop releases the head. I was a high school wrestler. One of the first things a wrestler learns is that if you control the head, you control the rest of the body. The officer is merely doing his job, restraining and controlling Garner until the other officers get the cuffs on.\n\n--In years past, the officers would have whacked Garner with their clubs, shot him with a taser, or maced him. Because these methods sometimes cause deaths or injuries and are sometimes regarded as cruel, the officers preferred to restrain him physically, which might be less harmful to the suspect, if multiple officers cooperate in the takedown.\n\n--It's true that Garner was unarmed. He wasn't a threat to the lives of the officers. In this situation, however, officers are very concerned about the risk twisted knees, low back injuries, and that sort of thing. With a very large, aggressive suspect, this is a serious concern. Injuries like that end police careers all the time, because police officers often have to restrain combative suspects like Garner.\n\n--Garner is saying or yelling, \"I can't breathe!\" The police union has pointed out, correctly, that if you can talk or shout, you are, in fact breathing. It's not quite clear why he is yelling, \"I can't breathe.\" He continues to say it after the headlock is released, after he is cuffed, and after the cops roll him on his side.\n\n--It is dangerous for a big, heavy man to be cuffed and left face-down. The officers know that and properly roll him on his side. He continues to say, \"I can't breathe,\" possibly because he is having an asthma attack. The officers properly called for an ambulance right away. Police officers don't know how to diagnose and treat asthma, and Garner has been so aggressive and resistive that removing Garner's cuffs would endanger the officers.\n\n--Garner died of a cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. A bad asthma attack can cause a cardiac arrest.\n\n--The coroner's report states that Garner's windpipe was not injured and his hyoid bone was not broken. (The hyoid bone is usually broken when people are strangled to death.)\n\n--It is not clear why Garner suffered a cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. However, he was grossly obese, a heavy smoker, he had evidence of heart disease, and he had asthma. The coroner's report notes all of these contributing factors. A vigorous struggle with several officers might have been enough to trigger a cardiac arrest. Running up a few flights of stairs could have had exactly the same effect on Garner.\n\n--The coroner's report states that homicide was the cause of death. This can be misunderstood. Homicide only means that the actions of one person caused another person to die. If a dangerous intruder breaks into my home and I shoot him in self defense, I have also committed \"homicide.\" Homicide is often misunderstood as \"murder,\" but it isn't.\n\n--The coroner's report is somewhat ambiguous and I have not seen an adequate explanation of it. The coroner says death was caused by \"compression of the neck,\" yet the windpipe was undamaged, the hyoid bone was not broken, and Garner remained conscious until some time after he entered the ambulance.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But once you get out there a ways, it gets pretty difficult due to how radio signals work.  The further away you get from a transmitter, the more and more spread out the signal is.  If you take a laser pointer and shine it at a wall several hundred feet away, the dot is noticeably bigger than if you shine it a few feet away.  Same concept with radio or any other type of transmission.\n\nNow extrapolate that over unimaginably large distances.  The signal to noise ratio of your transmission drops to below the threshold of cosmic background radiation, rendering it completely gone.\n\nPeople have a tendency to use the \"but technology\" argument in response to this, but it's really very straightforward stuff.  Signaling theory, information theory, transmission theory, these are well-understood frameworks.\n\n\"But what if we just crank up the signal?\"  Well, unless you can do something on the order of making a star go nova on demand, good luck with that (and of course the problem of having someone notice what you did).  The amount of power you need to overcome this problem over interstellar distances is on par with something like that.\n\nThe answer to your question is quite mundane.\n\nThe ability to detect things like radio transmissions of any discernable quality beyond maybe a couple of light years away (if even that) is impossible due to signal propagation.\n\nSo even if there are aliens out there looking for us - and let's say they even happen to be looking right at us, and happen to be looking on the right frequencies, and all of that due to pure unimaginable coincidence - they won't see or hear any of our radio transmissions because they will have dwindled down to zero long before the aliens ever had a chance to see them.\n\nAnd vice-versa."}, {"id": "cmqgfex", "body": "&gt;The reason that we haven't come across any signs of aliens is because every sentient species that comes to be eventually self-destructs.\n\nUhh, not likely.

They will attempt to out compete their competitors, and when they do not have significant competitors they will [push the resources of their environment to the limit.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event)\n\nThese are not human qualities, they are fundamental qualities of evolved life.  They are the process by which life evolves.  Life that does not possess these qualities will be out competed, that is the most basic definition of natural selection.\n\nI feel that all of the self centered behavior we talk about is an obvious extension of these qualities.  Humans worse behavior isn't unique on earth, I doubt it is unique across the universe.  It is often very useful behavior, especially while a group still has competitors.  It arises in simulations as well.\n\nIf aliens evolved through natural selection, my bet is they are quite similar to humans in the weapons, greed, mass extinction regard, or at least were in the past.\n\n-----\n\nThere are some good arguments though.\n\nThe age of the universe is ~14.5 billion.  Sol is a third generation star, the first generation didn't have heavy elements so there was less interesting chemistry (like life on earth requires).  Once life on earth got started, it took 4 billion years to get to intelligence, the first billion of which was all single celled organisms.\n\nWe have no equals on this planet.  There isn't any organism that is even close to being able to use history, foresight and technology the way humans can.  Many people do underestimate the intelligence of animals, but they are still profoundly incapable compared to us.  Point being, of the planets that have intelligent life capability, earth may be one of the faster.\n\nWe got lucky on earth in a lot of ways.

We share that distinction with some species of whales and dolphins (which are as smart or smarter) and some other primates (which are perhaps not as smart but still \"intelligent\" in my mind) and possibly even some parrots (very smart). In none of these cases do we have an example of a species destroying itself.\n\nGranted, we've got just a handful of species to draw conclusions from. But it's a small sample size with no examples to demonstrate your thesis.\n\nOn humans specifically - we've had the capacity to wipe ourselves out for over half a century and haven't done it yet. And decade over decade, the odds of that happening seem less, not more. If it's our nature to destroy ourselves, we're bad at it.\n\nAnd in fact the long arc of history is that humans have gotten less violent, fought fewer, and become better at cooperation (aka, economics). You mention Darwinism, but this is actually what evolution would predict. Cooperation is the better survival strategy for all involved, and over time it's the societies that were more insular and more war-like that have fell in the dustbin of history.

Others could have evolved under different evolutionary pressures leading them to be instinctually cooperative - hive minds or collective intelligence, for example. Or AI - it's not unreasonable to think that robots will explore the galaxy rather than biological humans (since we're not really evolved to survive in space), but there's no reason to think an artifical intelligence would have any propensity for destroying itself.\n\nThere are plenty of other potential answers to the Fermi paradox that don't assume self annihilation. My personal belief is simply that we don't have the technology to detect other civilizations, nor the technology to make ourselves known. Our radio signals are undetectable after a few light years, and the same is likely for any other radio based civilization.

This would include a large musculature, heavy defensive brow, thick hair over the body, aggressive behaviour, territorial feelings, and other similar behaviour we find in our close relatives. As we evolved into larger groups these had to be mitigated, and we can see this in other social animals like chimps, bonobos, gorillas, and also other more distantly related but similarly social animals like wolves, lions, penguins, even fish. The traits which are vital for individual survival and for survival in wild and dangerous environments are not ideal for social situations. We have had millions of years to soften up these traits, selecting for communal features like a softer tone, humour, compassion, and other similar traits. We can also see these things in the other animals mentioned before, for example wolves adopting cubs from other animals even though they could eat them, or lions playing with humans. \n\nWe are now in a world where our ability to mitigate these behaviours is increasingly vital as our destructive capabilities are immense and growing. We have, however, made progress. We can see that many such features are actually triggered in the womb by the timing and volume of testosterone and estrogen. These are changing now, and as a result the epigenetic expression of  these primal traits is reducing, effectively providing an evolutionary buffer zone for rapid adaptation to this new environment. I think that in a few hundred years we will have reached the limits of what epigenetic changes can do to our gene pool expression and further changes will have to be selected as per normal evolution, but we are likely to survive this period.

Others are going after you for assuming that aliens will be greedy and self-destructive.\n\nI'll instead offer other reasons entirely that we might not have encountered other intelligent life in a bulleted list.  This is a list of alternate explanations for your observation that there is no other intelligent life out there.\n\n* Intelligent life capable of interstellar travel may rely on some of the heavier elements in the universe.  We use nuclear technology as a fuel source in our military, and it's use in interstellar travel is extremely like by our current trajectory.  Any species that relies on nuclear energy must be relatively new (on the stellar timescale) because the density of high-mass elements relies on you existing on the timeline after a larger number of supernovae responsible for the formation of these elements.  Earlier intelligent civilizations may have simply evolved in systems long ago, with too few trace elements to develop useful interstellar technology.  Our counterparts may be out there, right now, colonizing their own moons.\n\n* Life itself may be rarer than we imagine.  We have a sample size of 1.  One planet friendly to us which contains life, and by the anthropic principle, any life form would witness the exact same wherever they are.  If we can get a drill onto Europa and find life there, the argument for the existence of extraterrestrial life (or exosolar life) is stronger, but not complete.  Life might well have colonized our system on asteroids knocked off of earth (a hypothesis not without merit).  We would still not have evidence of more than one independent abiogenesis.  If we found some bacteria on a planet orbiting Alpha-Centauri - well then we would have some hard facts to face.\n\n* Intelligence might be a lot less common than we think, and less of an advantage in its early stages.  Humans faced multiple near-extinctions if scientists are to be believed (I think they are), as did many species we live with today, and many more that didn't make it despite being better fit for their times.  We can point at chimpanzees (hardly an argument, since they're nearly us already), or whales or dolphins or parakeets to say that intelligence is common, but none of those species is calculating the load-capacity of aluminum and titanium for the purposes of launching vessels into orbit.  Indeed, even we weren't doing that until 100 years ago.  There was some critical point in human evolution a few ten thousand years ago that caused us to switch from the evolutionary timeline to the human one.  We move so fast that Cleopatra lived closer to the moon landing than the building of the pyramids.  Maybe no other life form has landed on the magic spot and they're all putting around farming for their feudal lords on a million backwater planets, killing one another over which deity placed the stars in the heavens.\n\n* Faster than Light Travel may be truly impossible.  If that's the case, then the time window in which other intelligent life would have had to evolve to create works that we could observe is drastically smaller.  The universe could be teeming with life and it just hasn't had time to make an appearance.\n\n* Their communication methods may be alien.  Although we think of EM radiation as the gold standard of distance communication, it does degrade when exposed to vacuum fluctuations, and disperses according to the inverse square law.  Other life may simply be too far away to broadcast a message that we can see.  If they knew we were here, maybe they could narrow-cast something to us, but our broadcasts have the same problem, and since we dont' know where tehy are, we can't send them anything either.  On top of this, all of our known communication methods also suffer the light-speed barrier.  Communication methods that would be more durable over the millennia in space may be undetectable to us.  Communications transmitted by neutrino bursts would be very, very resilient.  So resilient, in fact, that our ability to intercept and decode them would be extremely limited.  Maybe graviton-bursts (I'm getting deeper into speculative sci-fi vs. plausible sci-fi here) hold up over distances, but we aren't even looking at that.\n\n* All sufficiently advanced intelligent species may discover the sub-space infrastructure (fill in the future technology of your choice) put in place by Yog-Sothoth, calling the attention of the the lurker at the threshold down to devour the souls of all who can feel sorrow."}, {"id": "2ottrr", "body": "The reason that we haven't come across any signs of aliens is because every sentient species that comes to be eventually self-destructs.

The only option you are aware of to quench your thirst is to drink a glass of water. Does drinking that glass of water constitute a selfish act? No. It is not altruistic either. Drinking a glass of water when you're thirsty is not a situation that exists in that spectrum. There might be more effective ways of dealing with thirst, but if you are unaware of them or those methods are unavailable to you, your only option is to drink the glass of water.\n   \nIf suicide is anything, it is short sided. Pain, pleasure, happiness, and depression are not permanent conditions, they are temporary and fade with time.\n\nOn a personal note, in your original post you seemed like you were hurting pretty bad.

So I'll do my best to respond without an emotionally charged reply.\n\nLet me also preface by saying I've been diagnosed with clinical depression. I have been on anti-depressants and anxiety medication. An unstable upbringing led to constant suicidal thoughts in my teens and early twenties. I can promise you I was able to relate to my mother when she was intubated after hearing the nurse say \"it's up to her to live\" and telling my father \"the worst part is being able to relate. That feeling of utter hopelessness and not that you don't care about the ones around you but the only fucking thing you want is to be out of that mental state.\" So yes, I understand how 'my depression inconveniencing you' can turn into an infinite loop and spiral downward. So who's right?\n\nI personally think you're asking the wrong question. Look up the actual definition of 'selfish'. Sure, we're playing semantics but stay with me here. \"Having or showing concern only for yourself and not for the needs or feelings of other people.\" Sure, you may empathize with those left behind but just ultimately want your suffering to end and a quiet way out would be even better.\n\nSo why is suicide selfish? Because it's a zero-sum game. No matter the scenario, you end your suffering but the ones around you lose all ability for questions answered. You may truly not want them to feel upset, but you deciding to end your life is selfish in that you are choosing an option that never gives other parties a decision. Whereas if you choose to live, you both have infinite possibilities and variables to consider.\n\nI think what you truly want your view changed on, and again excuse the semantics, is that should selfishness even be a factor in suicide? Should one feel guilt for leaving others behind? Because as described above, it IS selfish. But should it matter? \n\nYes. Suicide is an absolute. The end. I'm not going to bombard you with \"time heals everything\" and \"trust me, it gets better\" as I'm sure you've seen or heard that enough times to vomit but here's the thing: if you end your life those questions remain unanswered... infinitely... for everyone. So I guess it's up to you if your absolute answer now is worth unanswered questions for everyone forever, rather than potential answers for both parties in the future.\n\nSo I'll end it off on a tangent by saying this... The cold, hard truth is that whoever tells you \"it gets better with time\" is wrong. Why? Because 'time' is not the independent variable. Time just leaves the possibility for your brain to distort what your feelings were or for you to go through an experience that is more meaningful than the pain you feel now. But that's the beauty. Check out Tony Robbin's neuro-associative conditioning and neuro-linguistic programming.

But it may be.\n\nImagine a widow with 5 young children from a very poor country. She's lost her husband, and her children rely on her for mere survival. In this case, even if she was in extreme mental pain, it may still be selfish to kill herself.

If you want to feel better about it, then look up the definition of the word in the dictionary. It means to excessively and exclusively be concerned with oneself and concentrating on one's own well being without regard for others. Read the definition and forget about all the other connotations associated with the word. Those who commit suicide are completely absorbed in their own problems and can't move past them. They cannot find a reason to live. Some suicides are due to someone thinking that their loved ones would be better off without them, but it doesn't make it any less selfish, because they are so self absorbed they can't see that this simply isn't true. \n\nThose who commit suicide are mentally ill. They aren't thinking clearly and need help. Depression is a terrible disease that is difficult to diagnose and treat, because the first steps must be made from the depressed person seeking help. Many of these people don't take these first steps and can hide their symptoms from everyone they know. \n\nIt is a very selfish thing to do, but it's not selfish the way normal people are described as selfish. Blatantly ignoring the needs of others while only fulfilling your own needs is what normal selfish people do all the time. But a suicidal person is sick and can't help but be completely absorbed in their own pain and suffering. They have lost that battle against their pain, as it has completely consumed their mind. While they think they are doing others a favor by killing themselves, which is not selfish, in the end, actually doing it is. Because by definition, being selfish means to only tend to your own needs and not the needs of others. \n\nSo in a technical sense, suicide is selfish. But many people don't understand why people take their own lives, and calling them selfish in a judgmental way is insensitive and pointless.

I just need you to tell me how selfish I am."}, {"id": "cmqi5ub", "body": "So let me start off by saying that there are plenty of times where it is *rational* to commit suicide. The obvious examples are when a person is in a lot of pain or has a terminal disease where the quality of life is eventually going to go downhill rapidly. In other cases, the person may simply not ever be able to feel joy again for some reason, or may be facing an inescapable hardship that is worse than death (torture, for example). In these (somewhat rare) cases it is within the person's rational self-interest to kill themselves. \n\nIn some ways suicide is the most selfish act that someone can ever commit. It is a universal declaration that you choose to live and die on your own terms and that your destiny lies wholly in your own hands. A rationally-committed suicide cannot be swayed by the wishes of others or any external sense of duty; a scenario like those listed above would mean that the actor is beyond those influences now. Rational suicide is, by definition, *selfish*...\n\nand that's **good**! Your life does indeed belong to you and not to anyone else. It is yours by right to do whatever you wish with it. Of every object and concept in the universe, it is the ONLY thing that will always be yours, (assuming that you haven't forfeited it by doing something stupid like robbing convenience stores). \n\nI believe the error here is with the assumption that anything selfish is automatically bad. Greed, lust, selfishness are only truly evil when you are greedy, lustful, or selfish *for the unearned*. Its perfectly moral to be greedy for a better life, lustful for a life full of value, or selfish when protecting the people/things/ideas that matter the most to you. The idea that you are either Ebenezer Scrooge or Mother Theresa depending on whether you want to improve your life or throw it away is probably the worst thing to ever come out of a Philosophy classroom.  If your life doesn't belong to you for you to pursue what you value the most, then what could it possibly ever be for? Who else could it ever belong to?\n\n**TLDR; Yes, suicide is *selfish* by definition... and that's OK!** \n\n*edit: automatic words became automatically redundant*"}, {"id": "2osz8g", "body": "That's people's favorite counter to suicide - it's so selfish.
