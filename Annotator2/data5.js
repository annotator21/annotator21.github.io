Russia's currency is in the toilet, it's central bank is brutally hiking interest rates, and Putin was counting on oil revenue to keep the lights on. \n\nOil demand is slumping globally as China's economy is rolling over, the USA is producing massive quantities of shale oil, and the European Union languishes in the mud. \n\nThe Saudis can still make a fat profit on $50/barrel -- their cost to produce is estimated at $10/barrel, so the price war has no end in sight. \n\nI would argue that this combination of geopolitical pressures points to crisis. Technical traders are already pointing to deflationary signals in markets across the globe. \n\nDomestic US stocks won't escape the tumult either, and the US bond market is under severe pressure as well. 20% of high-yield bonds are tied up in shale drilling operations that can't operate at current prices.\n\nIf US domestic stocks are due for a spill due to an over-reliance on outsourced foreign solvency, and domestic bonds are due for a spill -- if Russian citizens can't buy bread with inflated currency and Putin can't keep the lights on -- if China's having a fire sale of foreign assets to meet its domestic central bank's collateral obligations -- if the EU can't swim with Greece's debt -- I find it hard to see how 2015 will be a good year for anybody.\n\nEconomic optimists, CMV!"}, {"id": "cmxeb7m", "body": "I think you're putting the cart before the horse.

I've read a little about experimental methods to extract shale oil, including using sonic waves instead of hydraulic fracking.

Quebec [used this](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bill-178/) to implement incredibly strong restrictions on speech in languages other than French.\n\nThe [*Oakes*](http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/OJEN_Oakes.pdf) test used by Canadian courts to determine if a violation of constitutional rights under Section 1 can be permitted is incredibly weak.\n\nUnder *Oakes* the government must show that \n\n1. The infringement is rationally related to a government objective.\n\n2. The impairment of rights has to be \"as little as is reasonably possible\" (and this one keeps creeping up, used to be \"minimal impairment.\")\n\n3. There must be proportionality between the infringement and the objective.\n\nIn contrast, in the US, a restriction on free speech like in the *Whatcott* case above would be subject to [strict scrutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny)  To meet the strict scrutiny standard the restriction must:\n\n1. Be justified by a compelling government interest.  The reason for the restriction has to be something the government *has* to do, not merely something they want to do.\n\n2. Be narrowly tailored to that interest.  That is, the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do.\n\n3. Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest.  That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal, it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the US took on a case of much more hateful anti-gay speech than the *Whatcott* case right around the same time.  [That opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-751.pdf) sums up the US attitude to speech pretty well:\n\n&gt;Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and\u2014as it did here\u2014inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course\u2014to protect even hurtful\nspeech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. \n\nAll my Canadian friends think this I'm crazy for agreeing with this and wanting to allow people like the Westboro church (who were the people in that case) to speak freely.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But if you look at the case law you'll find a bit more nuance than your somewhat selective reading indicates. \n\nFirst, and most importantly: The Constitution (in both Canada and the US) is not a written document, it is what the courts say it is. This is not, in practice, a license for judicial tyranny, and it means that s. 1 does not gut the Charter. In practice the governemtn frequently does not meet the s. 1 standard.\n\nSpeech Rights: The court has adopted several specific tests for s. 2 and s.1 analysis about speech rights. They aren't important. What is important is the content of those tests. In [R v Keegstra](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/695/index.do) the court adopted a purposive approach to speech rights. They identified the purpose of the s. 2 protections as being the free flow of ideas, something democratic, and something about self-actualisation (I don't remember the exact words). Certain forms of speech that undermine these values (e.g. threats, some instances of hate speech, especially if said by a public figure) are granted diminished protections. You may disagree with this, but the important part is that the vast majority of speech is offered much higher degree of protection, in practice. This is why:\n\n* Commercial speech is difficult to restrict. A law preventing the hanging of signs was held not to prevent someone hanging a sign that denounced a local business as dishonest. Tobacco advertising restrictions were weakened after a couple a sequential cases.\n\n* The right to picket has usually been upheld under speech protections, as have a number of speech acts\n\n* Political speech, news media, and art are difficult to restrict. An ambient noise/nuisance law used to fine a strip club in Montreal was shut down. Laws preventing individuals from campaigning have been narrowed or struck.\n\ns. 7: I don't think speech rights are the most important, and certainly aren't the only, rights protected by the Charter. It also includes s.7, \"the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\" The important thing about s. 7 is that *no law found violating s. 7 has ever been upheld under s. 1*. That's pretty effective. This is why that tribunal you linked to actually has limited powers; a wide array of punishments are tied to certain aspects of due process. \n\nOther Rights: I don't know much about the freedom of movement, but the case you linked to seems like a pretty narrow and specific restriction which is all s. 1 was designed to permit. s. 2 has also been a consistently effective guarantor of religious rights. Trinity Western Teaching College was, in spite of its frankly offensive policies towards gays in particular, was not denied accreditation or public funding b/c of s. 2; it also explicitly guarantees the rights of religious schools. The Charter has been used to strike laws restricting sex work, language rights, and a wide variety of abusive police tactics.\n\nClarity and Flexibility: All constitutions are, AFAIK, flexible when it comes to fundamental rights. The US Charter doesn't identify any standard of scrutiny; a fairly elaborate body of jurisprudence needed to be developed to accommodate the realities of governance. The Canadian Charter is much, clearer, more realistic, less divisive and more usable because of this. It is embodies language that allows it to be developed by the courts within certain limits over time (e.g. s. 15). This is important b/c constitutions inevitably change over time and when there are no textual limits on that change you arrive at a situation like what exists in teh US where the Constitution enforced by the courts bears little resemblance to the Constitution as written (it's really interesting to note the universally acknowledged importance of intent-based interpretation of the Constitution in Canada. In the US that's a very controversial doctrine). The flexibility of the Charter means it will not break (i.e. be ignored or interpreted out of existence).\n\nPositive Rights: The Canadian Charter recognises in several places the importance of positive rights in a way that the American Constitution does not. I'm thinking in particular of s. 15(2) which says \"Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals.\" It also explicitly guarantees a right to legal counsel, and a number of language rights. And, perhaps most importantly, 15(1) enshrines a *de facto* duty to accommodate on the government (equal Benefit of the law etc...) in a way that the Constitution of the US does not. Canada also has a statutory bill of rights that has been recognised as quasi-constitutional (remember what I said above about judicial constructivism?). This serves to protect a variety of property rights (which are neglected by the Charter) and supplement the ant-discriminatory protections. \n\nThe Charter is more effective in addressing your concerns than you think. It is also very good at protecting those things that are most important (life, liberty, process rights). It is also much more realistic than the US constitution by acknowledging the need to protect certain positive rights.\n\nEdit: I forgot about the notwithstanding clause. That can be shitty. All I'll say is that it's literally never used. Alberta used it once (and failed anyway), Quebec used it in the 80s, and that's it. A few more decades and it'll probably be declared a dead letter. However s. 33 is self-limiting and narrow in application (only provinces legislating with respect to provincial domains, and with respect to a few sections. s. 33 also does not obviate the Provincial bills of rights that are in force in every province. \n\nEdit2 (Rights Clash): I think example may clarify what I'm trying to say. If the American government had something really important it needed to do (or, frankly, something not all that important) and it needed to violate the Constitution to do it the at least 5 Justices would, in all likelihood, vote to reinterpret or reconstruct the Constitution permissively. This can be good or bad (Social Security v. Internment of Japanese). The decision will basically be based on whether the problem is important enough; this is was Scrutiny is about.

This is not, in practice, a license for judicial tyranny, and it means that s. 1 does not gut the Charter. In practice the [government] frequently does not meet the s. 1 standard.\n\nI agree with this, though in some of my more radical moments, I am tempted to go all Hugo Black and say that [\"no law means no law.\"](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/713)\n\nIn regard to the *Keegstra* decision, it actually has a quite interesting discussion of the applicability of First Amendment jurisprudence to the case at hand.  Though the Canadian Supreme Court does seem to take a bit of liberty in saying that Keegstra's speech wouldn't be constitutionally protected in the US.  [*National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie* (1977)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/432/43/) seems the most on point.\n\nBut I digress.  \n\nI agree from your examples that there is some protection afforded to speech by the Charter, and that the government can't just pass whatever it wants.  I still find the hate speech question disturbing though, as well as Canada's libel laws, though I don't know the caselaw there as well.  Do you know if s.2 has been applied to civil actions such as libel?  [NY Times Co. v. Sullivan](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/376/254) is a really big free speech case on that in US jurisprudence; is there any Canadian counterpart on the question?\n\nOn s.7, I have two concerns.  First, the lack of property protection, which as you say is done through statute having quasi-constitutional status.  And second, what is the meaning of \"the principles of fundamental justice\" in s.7.  I'm reading up on it a little bit; it seems like it was very vaguely defined when it was put in the Constitution.\n\nI do find some comfort in the fact that no act violating s.7 has been justified under s.1.  Though I wonder how the hell the federal and provincial human rights tribunals passed muster under s.7.  Maybe the lack of property rights protections?  I detest the human rights tribunals - I think they're kangaroo courts.  The important stuff that goes to them could be handled in real courts of law with rules of evidence and procedure, right to counsel, etc.\n\n&gt;Clarity and Flexibility: All constitutions are, AFAIK, flexible when it comes to fundamental rights. The US Charter doesn't identify any standard of scrutiny; a fairly elaborate body of jurisprudence needed to be developed to accommodate the realities of governance. The Canadian Charter is much, clearer, more realistic, less divisive and more usable because of this. It is embodies language that allows it to be developed by the courts within certain limits over time (e.g. s. 15). This is important b/c constitutions inevitably change over time and when there are no textual limits on that change you arrive at a situation like what exists in teh US where the Constitution enforced by the courts bears little resemblance to the Constitution as written (it's really interesting to note the universally acknowledged importance of intent-based interpretation of the Constitution in Canada. In the US that's a very controversial doctrine). The flexibility of the Charter means it will not break (i.e. be ignored or interpreted out of existence).\n\nThis is a good point and also I think has a lot to do with a couple other factors in Canadian government: the greater power of the Federal government and the more active common law.\n\nThe original US Constitution was developed for a small central government, with most governing happening at the state level.

The firm break and the quick adoption of a single written Constitution create a more textualist tradition.\n\n&gt;Positive Rights: The Canadian Charter recognises in several places the importance of positive rights in a way that the American Constitution does not.

And, perhaps most importantly, 15(1) enshrines a de facto duty to accommodate on the government (equal Benefit of the law etc...) in a way that the Constitution of the US does not.

This is not, in practice, a license for judicial tyranny, and it means that s. 1 does not gut the Charter. In practice the [government] frequently does not meet the s. 1 standard.\n\nI agree with this, though in some of my more radical moments, I am tempted to go all Hugo Black and say that [\"no law means no law.\"](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/713)\n\nIn regard to the *Keegstra* decision, it actually has a quite interesting discussion of the applicability of First Amendment jurisprudence to the case at hand.  Though the Canadian Supreme Court does seem to take a bit of liberty in saying that Keegstra's speech wouldn't be constitutionally protected in the US.  [*National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie* (1977)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/432/43/) seems the most on point.\n\nBut I digress.  \n\nI agree from your examples that there is some protection afforded to speech by the Charter, and that the government can't just pass whatever it wants.  I still find the hate speech question disturbing though, as well as Canada's libel laws, though I don't know the caselaw there as well.  Do you know if s.2 has been applied to civil actions such as libel?  [NY Times Co. v. Sullivan](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/376/254) is a really big free speech case on that in US jurisprudence; is there any Canadian counterpart on the question?\n\nOn s.7, I have two concerns.  First, the lack of property protection, which as you say is done through statute having quasi-constitutional status.  And second, what is the meaning of \"the principles of fundamental justice\" in s.7.  I'm reading up on it a little bit; it seems like it was very vaguely defined when it was put in the Constitution.\n\nI do find some comfort in the fact that no act violating s.7 has been justified under s.1.  Though I wonder how the hell the federal and provincial human rights tribunals passed muster under s.7.  Maybe the lack of property rights protections?  I detest the human rights tribunals - I think they're kangaroo courts.  The important stuff that goes to them could be handled in real courts of law with rules of evidence and procedure, right to counsel, etc.\n\n&gt;Clarity and Flexibility: All constitutions are, AFAIK, flexible when it comes to fundamental rights. The US Charter doesn't identify any standard of scrutiny; a fairly elaborate body of jurisprudence needed to be developed to accommodate the realities of governance. The Canadian Charter is much, clearer, more realistic, less divisive and more usable because of this. It is embodies language that allows it to be developed by the courts within certain limits over time (e.g. s. 15). This is important b/c constitutions inevitably change over time and when there are no textual limits on that change you arrive at a situation like what exists in teh US where the Constitution enforced by the courts bears little resemblance to the Constitution as written (it's really interesting to note the universally acknowledged importance of intent-based interpretation of the Constitution in Canada. In the US that's a very controversial doctrine). The flexibility of the Charter means it will not break (i.e. be ignored or interpreted out of existence).\n\nThis is a good point and also I think has a lot to do with a couple other factors in Canadian government: the greater power of the Federal government and the more active common law.\n\nThe original US Constitution was developed for a small central government, with most governing happening at the state level.  Because of that, it took doctrinal court rulings (and the 14th amendment, which is just *super* important to American rights law) to make the bill of rights into a comprehensive rights document.  \n\nAlso, Canada has much more active common law traditions, stemming from the English law, where there is nothing but common law for the Constitution.  In contrast, US courts tend to only look to pre-revolutionary common law, and see the American Revolution as a break, after which only American law (and especially the Constitution) are supreme.  The firm break and the quick adoption of a single written Constitution create a more textualist tradition.\n\n&gt;Positive Rights: The Canadian Charter recognises in several places the importance of positive rights in a way that the American Constitution does not. I'm thinking in particular of s. 15(2) which says \"Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals.\" It also explicitly guarantees a right to legal counsel, and a number of language rights.

There's some overlap, but the four protections are distinct. It's possible that 'equal protection' in the 14th has been understood to refer to all four. I don't know at all. The important one here is 'equal benefit' of the law.

This was significant for recognising sexuality as an 'analogous ground' (a phrase that imports flexibility into the Charter and allows it to recognise new grounds of invalid discrimination where appropriate). But it also demonstrates what is meant by 'equal benefit.' The government cannot offer a benefit without ensuring that people do not fail to receive it based on an enumerated or analogous ground (e.g. sex, race etc...) (also subject to s. 1). Importantly this does not just protect people from explicit discrimination. The incidental consequences or adverse effects are considered equally valid means by which a government action could fail to provide 'equal benefit.' This includes things that occur that aren't caused by the government. *Platy*, for instance, implies that if the government failed to address the sexual harassment of employees they would be violating the Charter (probably; I'm extrapolating from an HRC-based case on a fuzzy memory).

In practice the [government] frequently does not meet the s. 1 standard.\n\nI agree with this, though in some of my more radical moments, I am tempted to go all Hugo Black and say that [\"no law means no law.\"](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/713)\n\nIn regard to the *Keegstra* decision, it actually has a quite interesting discussion of the applicability of First Amendment jurisprudence to the case at hand.  Though the Canadian Supreme Court does seem to take a bit of liberty in saying that Keegstra's speech wouldn't be constitutionally protected in the US.  [*National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie* (1977)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/432/43/) seems the most on point.\n\nBut I digress.  \n\nI agree from your examples that there is some protection afforded to speech by the Charter, and that the government can't just pass whatever it wants.  I still find the hate speech question disturbing though, as well as Canada's libel laws, though I don't know the caselaw there as well.  Do you know if s.2 has been applied to civil actions such as libel?  [NY Times Co. v. Sullivan](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/376/254) is a really big free speech case on that in US jurisprudence; is there any Canadian counterpart on the question?\n\nOn s.7, I have two concerns.  First, the lack of property protection, which as you say is done through statute having quasi-constitutional status.  And second, what is the meaning of \"the principles of fundamental justice\" in s.7.  I'm reading up on it a little bit; it seems like it was very vaguely defined when it was put in the Constitution.\n\nI do find some comfort in the fact that no act violating s.7 has been justified under s.1.  Though I wonder how the hell the federal and provincial human rights tribunals passed muster under s.7.  Maybe the lack of property rights protections?  I detest the human rights tribunals - I think they're kangaroo courts.  The important stuff that goes to them could be handled in real courts of law with rules of evidence and procedure, right to counsel, etc.\n\n&gt;Clarity and Flexibility: All constitutions are, AFAIK, flexible when it comes to fundamental rights. The US Charter doesn't identify any standard of scrutiny; a fairly elaborate body of jurisprudence needed to be developed to accommodate the realities of governance. The Canadian Charter is much, clearer, more realistic, less divisive and more usable because of this. It is embodies language that allows it to be developed by the courts within certain limits over time (e.g. s. 15). This is important b/c constitutions inevitably change over time and when there are no textual limits on that change you arrive at a situation like what exists in teh US where the Constitution enforced by the courts bears little resemblance to the Constitution as written (it's really interesting to note the universally acknowledged importance of intent-based interpretation of the Constitution in Canada. In the US that's a very controversial doctrine). The flexibility of the Charter means it will not break (i.e. be ignored or interpreted out of existence).\n\nThis is a good point and also I think has a lot to do with a couple other factors in Canadian government: the greater power of the Federal government and the more active common law.\n\nThe original US Constitution was developed for a small central government, with most governing happening at the state level.  Because of that, it took doctrinal court rulings (and the 14th amendment, which is just *super* important to American rights law) to make the bill of rights into a comprehensive rights document.  \n\nAlso, Canada has much more active common law traditions, stemming from the English law, where there is nothing but common law for the Constitution.  In contrast, US courts tend to only look to pre-revolutionary common law, and see the American Revolution as a break, after which only American law (and especially the Constitution) are supreme.  The firm break and the quick adoption of a single written Constitution create a more textualist tradition.\n\n&gt;Positive Rights: The Canadian Charter recognises in several places the importance of positive rights in a way that the American Constitution does not. I'm thinking in particular of s. 15(2) which says \"Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals.\" It also explicitly guarantees a right to legal counsel, and a number of language rights. And, perhaps most importantly, 15(1) enshrines a de facto duty to accommodate on the government (equal Benefit of the law etc...) in a way that the Constitution of the US does not. Canada also has a statutory bill of rights that has been recognised as quasi-constitutional (remember what I said above about judicial constructivism?). This serves to protect a variety of property rights (which are neglected by the Charter) and supplement the ant-discriminatory protections.\n\nSome of this is textually covered in the US.  Right to counsel?  6th amendment has you covered.  Likewise, equal protection of the law?  14th amendment is super clear: you've got it.\n\nI don't know that American equal protection jurisprudence is very different from Canadian jurisprudence, although it does appear to be different on affirmative action.  Can you cite an example of the de facto duty to accomodate where that wouldn't apply in the US?  It seems interesting to me, but I can't think of how it'd apply.\n\nAgain though, thanks for the really thoughtful comment.\n\nEdit: I typed my response without seeing your edits.

Quebec [used this](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bill-178/) to implement incredibly strong restrictions on speech in languages other than French.\n\nThe [*Oakes*](http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/OJEN_Oakes.pdf) test used by Canadian courts to determine if a violation of constitutional rights under Section 1 can be permitted is incredibly weak.\n\nUnder *Oakes* the government must show that \n\n1. The infringement is rationally related to a government objective.\n\n2. The impairment of rights has to be \"as little as is reasonably possible\" (and this one keeps creeping up, used to be \"minimal impairment.\")\n\n3. There must be proportionality between the infringement and the objective.\n\nIn contrast, in the US, a restriction on free speech like in the *Whatcott* case above would be subject to [strict scrutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny)  To meet the strict scrutiny standard the restriction must:\n\n1. Be justified by a compelling government interest.  The reason for the restriction has to be something the government *has* to do, not merely something they want to do.\n\n2. Be narrowly tailored to that interest.  That is, the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do.\n\n3. Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest.  That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal, it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the US took on a case of much more hateful anti-gay speech than the *Whatcott* case right around the same time.  [That opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-751.pdf) sums up the US attitude to speech pretty well:\n\n&gt;Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and\u2014as it did here\u2014inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course\u2014to protect even hurtful\nspeech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. \n\nAll my Canadian friends think this I'm crazy for agreeing with this and wanting to allow people like the Westboro church (who were the people in that case) to speak freely.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The actual law in the Criminal Code of Canada is as follows:\n\nWhatcott was civilly charged under the [Saskatchewan Human Rights Code](http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/S24-1.pdf), which requires in relevant part that:\n\n&gt;14(1)No person shall publish or display, or cause or permit to be published or displayed, on any lands or premises or in a newspaper, through a television or radio broadcasting station or any other broadcasting device, or in any printed matter or publication or by means of any other medium that the person owns, controls, distributes or sells, any representation, including any notice, sign, symbol, emblem, article, statement or other representation:\n\n&gt;(b) that exposes or tends to expose to hatred, ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of any person or class of persons on the basis of a prohibited ground.\n\nWhere prohibited ground is defined as:\n\n&gt;(i) religion;\n\n&gt;(ii) creed;\n\n&gt;(iii) marital status;\n\n&gt;(i) family status;\n\n&gt;(v) sex;\n\n&gt;(vi) sexual orientation;\n\n&gt;(vii) disability;\n\n&gt;(viii) age;\n\n&gt;(ix) colour;\n\n&gt;(x) ancestry;\n\n&gt;(xi) nationality;\n\n&gt;(xii) place of origin;\n\n&gt;(xiii) race or perceived race; and\n\n&gt;(xiv) receipt of public assistance;\n\nThat's an incredibly broad and troubling law.\n\n&gt;I don't want to convince you that the Canadian approach is better. I want to convince you that it is valid. Could you convince me that the American approach is better? I doubt it, and I'm not exactly averse to changing my political opinions. I think limiting the speech of bigots is desirable because not hearing them rant is better for everyone than hearing them speak is. That is pretty much all there is to it.\n\nI think this is the crux of the thing for me.  I don't consider Canadian law to be invalid - I just disagree with it.  Which is my right (I hope!)\n\nThe idea of limiting the speech of bigots to me goes against the best traditions of the English common law and of the uneven march of western civilization towards freedom.  Specifically, from a philosophical point I would point to John Stuart Mill's defense of allowing even wrong and bad speech in his book/essay [On Liberty](http://www.bartleby.com/130/) which is a classic of the western cannon.\n\n&gt;First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility. Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied. Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience."}, {"id": "2pjmrj", "body": "So as an American sorta-transplant to Canada and a law nerd, I get a decent amount of flak for my very American views on civil rights laws.\n\nSpecifically, I am a really big fan of super-strong free speech and free press laws, as well as really strong due process rights, and am very critical of many Canadian legal institutions which don't seem to respect these.\n\nThe biggest problem I have is with the [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html), and specifically with Section 1, and Section 33.\n\nSection 1 reads:\n\n&gt;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n\nSection 33 reads:\n\n&gt;(1) Parliament or the legislature of a province may expressly declare in an Act of Parliament or of the legislature, as the case may be, that the Act or a provision thereof shall operate notwithstanding a provision included in section 2 or sections 7 to 15 of this Charter.\n\nThese two, and particularly Section 1, gut the charter of any meaningful protection for civil liberties in Canada.\n\nSection 1 has been used to [fine people for handing out political pamphlets.](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/12876/index.do)  It has been used to deny people [freedom to travel.](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2009/01/29/court_restores_rule_that_denied_terrorist_a_passport.html)  It has been used to establish quasi judicial bodies which do not have [due process of law.](http://www.legal-project.org/issues/canada-hrc)\n\nSection 33 (called the notwithstanding clause) lets the government exempt any law from the Charter on its own say-so.

They know they have it and they know political speech is more protected than, say, commercial speech, but they usually don't understand time/place/manner restrictions or any other nuances that might come into play.\n\nMoreover, there's nothing in our Constitution that says \"Political speech is the most protected speech.\"  That's something we made up in case law.  It's familiar to you because you're an American and people tend to be more aware of and acclimated to the parameters of the law that applies to them than the super weird ones in other countries.

Look at the insane restrictions on freedoms and police actions that your government allows.  Kids in high school are stripped of a huge degree of freedom, just because a telecommunications signal exists the country suddenly it is open to government search and seizure, the president can take illegal executive action (the only case on point says it is illegal) and no one has standing to make the court stop him - so short of impeachment there is no constitutional control on a president who refuses to follow the laws as written.  Then we open up the entire can of worms over prosecutorial discretion.  Canada actually has very tight constitutional restrictions on how broad a criminal law can be.

To my knowledge, you have to provide documented proof that you have a learning disability to get these accommodations. \n\nDo you know how much that testing costs? Mine costed around $600. There are kids out there who don't have access to that kind of money, are ashamed that they may have a problem that's out of their control and that they don't understand, or don't have supportive parents or teachers who believe them. It baffles me that there are teachers who actually have this sort of *every student who does poorly is lazy* attitude - especially when students consistently fail their tests, quizzes, and assessments, and the teacher refuses to change their teaching methods or realize that maybe there is something they could do better to help students with difficulties. It's like, Christ, guess what? You're human too. You're preaching about the fact that students shouldn't deflect and neglect responsibility, but you can't even seem to admit that teachers can be *wrong* or that testing can be difficult for some students for multiple reasons. The world isn't black and white. \n\nAnd as I've said multiple times, *yes* it is important to take responsibility when you are to blame for doing poorly, but that doesn't just completely invalidate my point.

I wouldn't blame teachers directly, but do you really think in the situation I described, the students were at fault? I wasn't even talking about the AP test, I was talking about *the class itself.* Eventually, so many parents and students class after class complained so much that she was fired after last year, so at least there's that. \n\nAnd thank you for accusing me of lying, but I remember the experience very clearly, because it really sucked and was a daily occurrence throughout elementary school. My principal even suggested that I get tested for a learning disability, but my teachers punished me anyway and held me accountable. \n\nI remember one particular event like it was yesterday, because it made me feel so ashamed. We were instructed to translate a simple arithmetic problem from words to numbers. I couldn't comprehend the directions, much less how I was even supposed to do so. My teacher came over, noticing that I hadn't done what everyone else was doing. I remember feeling so anxious that I might throw up, seeing her approaching. Once she came over, she repeatedly told me over and over again to write the problem down. She started telling me that it shouldn't be so hard for me, that it was easy, to just do it already. I didn't know what to say, because I was too embarrassed to ask her for help - I felt really stupid. She finally grabbed the pencil from my hand and did it for me, without even explaining how to or why she did what she did. You can go ahead and accuse me of lying there too because you can't swallow the idea that you, as a teacher, are maybe to blame for these kinds of things, but if there's anything I've learned in my short time on this Earth (and I learned this the hard way), it's that *teachers are not gods, they are humans just like I am.*\n\nMy parents, who, even when I was really young were always careful to let me handle responsibility for my own conflicts, actually got angry enough to call my school. My mom had never done that before, and hasn't since. She never meddles in problems that she believes are mine to resolve.\n\nThat kind of harassment absolutely disgusts me, especially towards someone who might have an actual learning disability, and it deeply saddens me that there are tons of teachers out there who do this students - even students in elementary school. These teachers, who kids look up to, are scolding the kids for not understanding and making them feel inferior. \n\nI was really hoping you'd actually listen, as a teacher, because I have a feeling that the teachers who bullied me have attitudes and ideas that are very similar to yours, and I bet they'd accuse me of lying too, which is also incredibly disgusting considering the amount of emotional damage it did to such a young mind. \n\nBut you're obviously not going to change your mind. I don't think you even understand what I'm trying to get across, despite the fact that I've explicitly said it many times.

First of all, you're right; testing is not an adequate gauge of intellectual abilities.  Nor should it be.  Testing *should* be about mastery of the material.  Theoretically, a not very smart individual should be able to work extremely hard and understand the material enough to do well on a test.  More intelligent individuals will generally be able to do better with less work, but this will still depend on the person's understanding of the material; they will just obtain this understanding more easily.\n\nHowever, you seem to be conflating this notion with pointlessness.  \"If testing isn't gauging intelligence, then what is the point?\" you seem to ask.  And the point of testing is to assess the student's mastery of the material on the test.  Sometimes mastery of the material involves memorizing things.  In fact, it almost always does involve the student being able to know *something* without reference, though less so in math and science, where the student can always re-derive everything on the spot -- which is a waste of time, in my opinion, making memorization safer.\n\nIn a grander sense, testing does measure intellectual ability in that someone who does well on a test can be said to have the intellectual ability to master the material, but this ability includes the ability to work hard if the intellectual side is less present.  If you do well on all of your tests, either you worked hard or have natural ability, and in either case this means that you are likely to succeed in related tasks.\n\nHowever, you seem to also be asking *why* this material is being tested in the first place, making you memorize pointless facts and formulas.  When will you ever use them?  I think that's outside the scope of this discussion, frankly, because what you're really asking here is why we even bother getting an education.  If knowing history isn't important, why do we bother studying it?  Assuming you're American, I have one thing to say about that:\n\nRemember the Maine.\n\nIn 1898 the ship USS Maine suffered an explosion while in Cuba.  Newspapers of the time declared it sabotage in order to sell papers, and they were indeed very profitable!  This led to Congress declaring war on Spain -- Cuba was part of Spain at the time -- and we went to war, annexing the Philippines (also Spanish at the time) and Hawai'i, as well as trying to annex Cuba itself, though instead we set it up as an independent country with a puppet government controlled by the US.  The Cubans eventually got tired of US control and had a popular revolution, eventually siding with the Communists and starting an embargo that has been going on for decades for really no reason.  And this all happened because a story about sabotage was fabricated to bring profits to the news media, with a nice catchy slogan to make people care about this fake story -- the viral marketing of the time:\n\nRemember the Maine.\n\nRolls off the tongue, doesn't it?\n\nSo what do we learn from this?  Why can't you just Wikipedia the Spanish-American War to get these details?  Because the details are *not important*.  I'm sure I got some of them wrong.  I was going to mention Hearst and Pulitzer -- yes, the one that the prize is named after, which is horribly ironic, isn't it? -- but I didn't remember if it was actually one of them, or which one.  I think it was Hearst.  But it doesn't matter.  There are a number of lessons here that we, as an educated citizenry, need to be aware of in order to properly make this country work.  We need to be skeptical about what we read in the papers, and we need to understand that the government can also fall victim to propaganda -- and after studying the goings-on of the mid-20th century, we also learn that the government can make its *own* propaganda to lead us into a war where hundreds of thousands will die (look at Iraq!).  We get some historical context for why South Florida has such a large Cuban population (and why we can't get a decent vaca frita in Boston, damn it) and why the Cuban embargo is a big deal to some people -- who vote and may decide the electoral success of a candidate in Florida and the nation.  We learn that not all explosions are bombs and we learn that setting up puppet governments can backfire (look at Iran!).  We learn further about the dangers of colonialism (look at the entire Middle East and Islamic terrorism!) and the horrors that happen when we try to go to war with people who don't look exactly like us.\n\nRemember the Maine.\n\nThe historical facts are simply the most testable of the points of learning this history.  If you don't remember them, you won't even know what to look up when you want to see the whole story.  If you don't know that this conflict was known as the Spanish-American War -- a war between Spain and the US -- how are you even going to know what to search for?  At least this one has a catchy slogan!  The facts are touchpoints to help you understand the entire story.  It's important to know that it happened in 1898 so that when you're thinking about it, you can find the proper historical context.  What else was going on at that time?  It was the Gilded Age.  McKinley, an aristocrat, was president.  Labor was so horrible that Upton Sinclair had to write The Jungle, which led McKinley's successor -- he was assassinated, remember, by labor activist/anarchist Leon Czolgosz -- Teddy Roosevelt to reform the beef industry instead of actually reforming labor laws, because while McKinley was very deep in Big Beef's pockets, Roosevelt still couldn't piss off the entire business community by doing something silly like ensuring worker safety -- that had to wait until after the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.  Anyway, we're getting away from 1898, but the Gay Nineties (that's really what they were called) had a context and if we can understand this context, we can understand what's going on today, which policies to support, which politicians to declare to be complete imbeciles (hint: they're mostly from Texas these days), etc.  History is how we shape public opinion, and these little facts are what we mentally connect in order to form the story of history.\n\nThis is just one field.  Others are similar.  The situations where we need the facts are not when researching history -- we can always just look them up then.  We need them in our everyday thinking in order to contextualize things."}, {"id": "2pjbkm", "body": "I certainly see how testing is necessary to motivate students to actually process and store information. \n\nHowever I do not believe that it will ever be an appropriate gage of actual intelligence.

What it is is a kind of abstraction that correlates all of the features of various IQ tests (memory, recognition speed, problem solving, logical analysis, etc.).

At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50\u2013.60, .40\u2013.50, and .30\u2013.40, respectively  \n\n* According to research by Robert L. Thorndike, 80 to 90 percent of the predictable variance in scholastic performance is due to g, with the rest attributed to non-g factors measured by IQ and other tests.  \n\n* Research suggests that the SAT, widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of g. A correlation of .82 has been found between g scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores.  \n\n* There is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the average general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and g is lower \u2013 one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 corrected for attenuation).  \n\n* The correlation between income and g, as measured by IQ scores, averages about .40 across studies. The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.  \n\n* The g factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with g independent of social class of origin.[68] Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to g, with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood.  \n\n**TL;DR: If you do well on standardized aptitude/achievement tests, you're at least 60% more likely to make higher than average grades, 80 to 90% likely to do well on the SAT, 90-95% more likely to become a doctor, attorney or business executive (or similar high-prestige profession), about 40% more likely to earn a higher income, and much less likely to have social behavior problems.

As to whether they correlate to the hypothetical \"g factor\" (which sounds like something dirty now I think about it), and whether the g factor measurement correlates to some actual feature or function of the brain is way above my pay grade. All I can tell you is that many cognitive scientists have found that it can be measured and that it is highly predictive of many of the items I listed. Predictive meaning that you can calculate someone's g factor when they are 10 years old and use it to predict their education level, high school &amp; college GPA, SAT scores, achievement &amp; aptitude test scores, career level, salary, criminal record, value of their home, etc. when they are 40 with far better than 50-50 accuracy. That definitely means something... however exactly what it means is still very much an open question. \"G factor\" is basically equivalent to saying \"some unknown variable we can measure but we have no friggin idea what it is.\"  \n\nI absolutely agree with you that standardized tests are culturally biased. Indeed, it's hard to see how they could be otherwise, since \"intelligence,\" \"literacy,\" \"aptitude\" and so forth are all defined entirely by a given culture. Different cultures think in fundamentally different ways (cf. [the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity), somewhat discredited but I believe it has merit).

What CMV means is that a person holds a belief that they've come to realize is controversial or against the mainstream, they believe they have the correct position based on reason, and they are giving people the opportunity to present the evidence that their position is wrong, possible evidence or reasoning that the OP is just unaware of. If others cannot do that, then the OP is more confident that they hold the correct view. CMV is a challenge, not a goal.\n\nFrankly, I think that's the way it should be. It is scientific, intellectual, and well-reasoned. Rather than rhetorical fights from safety in echo chambers (subreddits, blogs, social groups, etc.), it is basically a declaration that people are willing to cut away all of the filters, put their belief out there for challenging, and evaluate the challenges. While they may refuse to acknowledge good points and leave unchanged, they are still taking the huge risk in posting to CMV in that *other people* can see the exchange because it is public, and if other people see the evidence for the opposite view then they will tend to go the other way.\n\nI have certainly done this. I presented my position on a topic, the reasoning, and the evidence, complete with references. Many commenters made bad arguments and I pointed out the errors and fallacies in their arguments. One commenter then said (paraphrased), \"You are just refuting what others are saying. You aren't interested in changing your view.\"\n\nWhen I see what you've written here, it seems to be along those lines, that changing views should be a goal of any post in CMV. In fact, good debate should be the goal. The OP may have the strength of evidence on their side and be the better debater. Or, they may have weak evidence or erroneous thinking that is revealed.\n\nTo quote Joseph Joubert, \"The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not be victory, but progress.\"\n\nEven if the OP is stubborn and fails to accept criticisms, the CMV is still of value exactly *because* it is a public debate. They may not personally think their position was invalidated in the debate, but others might. Or others might see they OP was correct. Heck, I've even argued that the OP position was correct even after the OP declared they did change their view.\n\nI would even argue the opposite of this current CMV is true; that some people post CMV positions that they don't actually believe in as a means to undermine that position, often using weak or strawman arguments, then quickly declaring they changed their view without putting up much of a fight.\n\nBut even then it's still of value as long as enough people correct the OP argument errors and present what the OP position was correct despite these errors. That is the value of debate: progress. What the OP does or doesn't do is largely irrelevant.\n\n"}, {"id": "2pimzj", "body": "I think we ache to be heard, and CMV is a devil's bargain: in exchange for fulfilling the need to be heard, we offer our mind up to be operated on by language.\n\nChanging one's view is actually a somewhat painful process--learning new information is hard, feeling empathy for someone else is exhausting, admitting to a wrong or incomplete view is discouraging, and opening one's ideas to vulnerable cross examination is frightening.\n\nWhat most of us actually want (and need) is to be heard in the complete sense--to know that someone else understands the context and specifics of our suffering (whether great or small).

Suppose for simplicity you were 50% likely to keep lobster as one of your options. Once you have chosen not to eat lobster, you are 50/50 between spag and chicken. i.e. your probability of choosing spag on a given day is P(spaghetti given no lobster) = .5* .5/(.5)=.5. If you had chosen to keep lobster, you would have liked, say, all three foods with 1/3 probability, hence your choice would be P(spaghetti given lobster)=.5* .33/(.5)=.33. \n\ntl;dr every choice you make impacts your final outcome"}, {"id": "cmx11ef", "body": "So to be clear, you'd say that all engaged men also make a choice on their last name just like engaged women do?
