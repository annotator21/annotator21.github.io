While it may be true that many overweight people don't eat healthy and/or don't exercise, the reality of the situation is probably much more complicated than that. There are many factors that can lead to someone being overweight, including genetics, stress, depression, chronic disease, injuries, and lack of nutritional education. There are also many conditions that can result from being overweight that may impair their ability to properly eat healthy and/or exercise. While I believe that properly taking care of yourself and your body is ideal, I am not going to question or criticize people who are happy with themselves might they be overweight. Stress is a very big factor in causing obesity, so I'm not going to add to a person's stress by questioning their lifestyle if it's none of my business or they didn't directly ask me for an opinion.

Fad diets do not work in the long run. You have to make a complete lifestyle change on the simple basis of eating less and moving more. \n\nHonestly, it is a simple issue of willpower. If you do not have the willpower to *just eat less* and move just a little bit more, then no, you are not going to lose weight. I have yet to hear another reasonable reason for being overweight. VERY FEW people actually have medical conditions that prevent them from losing weight.\n\nThe **vast** majority of overweight people simply lack the willpower and/or fortitude to lose weight. I am also of the opinion that 99% of people would be more happy being a normal weight then being overweight.\n\n\nThink about it like this. Lets imagine: after you die, you have the ability to reincarnate as a human and choose your physical features. Would you really choose to be fat again? Or would you choose to have a normal, or athletic body? \n\n\nI'd bet almost everyone would take the second option."}, {"id": "2o3isd", "body": "There is a lot going around the internet in regards to people being comfortable with their weight.

These threats have enabled mainstream media coverage to create a straw man of any opposition to them and has poisoned the well for anyone who finds their views problematic that wants to have a public dialogue about them.

The narrative for almost all mainstream coverage of these women  universally supports them, and an inordinate portion of these articles focuses on harassment from a small group of psychopaths and trolls, which usually includes quotes of some of the most tasteless comments for shock value. Because of this, I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much, I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake, anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this, while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women, I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You are using \"feminists\" to label only one small specific subgroup of feminists that are focused on the gaming industry. For clarify, let's use \"gamer-feminists,\" yeah?\n\nSo gamer-feminists have a goal of making video games more friendly to women by promoting the use of women less as background objects and literal \"prizes\" to be won in a game, and more as the lead characters that the gamer actually plays as. Gamer-feminists also have a goal of making the gaming community more friendly to women by calling out the harassment women receive in online playing communities. \n\nSo no, harassing women themselves while posing as men (this coming from an assumption that all gamer-feminists are women, which isn't true) would not help gamer-feminists achieve their goals of making the gaming community more friendly to women. It does the exact opposite. It perpetuates the very harassment of women that they're trying to combat. Unless you think feminism/gamer-feminism has the goal of making men look bad, which it doesn't, then I really don't see how you'd think gamer-feminists posing as men to harass women helps achieve their goals of stopping harassment against women.

If she didn't disable comments, most of the hate mail would probably be on YouTube. And the reason she likely disabled the comments was because of the previous hate mail she received.

Sarkeesian certainly does not claim that. \n\n&gt; Interestingly the kerfluffle with the FYC claiming she doxxed them happened after the zoe post. The complaints about Wizardchan and the like also came about after the zoe post.\n\nIncorrect. The zoepost was August 17, 2014. The kerfluffle with Wizardchan began in December 2013:\n\nOn December 4th, 2013, Quinn submitted her game Depression Quest to Steam Greenlight[1] to be selected for release on the software distribution service. On December 12th, Quinn (@Quinnspiracy) posted several tweets complaining about harassment she had allegedly received for placing the game on Greenlight, specifically from the *chan board Wizardchan.[2] O\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=200770535searchtext=depression+quest\n\nhttps://storify.com/SeeBeeWhitman/depression-quest-harassment-campaign\n\nPrior to the release of Quinn\u2019s game, on April 11th, 2014, Wizardchan, the site Quinn said she had allegedly received harassment from for placing the game on Greenlight in December 2013, counterclaimed that they did not doxx her in a series of images that conveys their side of the story with a chronological breakdown and an explanation why they didn\u2019t target her.[15]\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4VOcx\n\nAccording to the Fine Young Capitalists, Zoe Quinn started attacking them before the zoepost.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d6Q3VpqXyk#t=250\n\n&gt; I don't understand why you're comparing women who want the games industry to be less misogynistic with Civil Rights activists or why we should even expect that kind of comparison.\n\nBecause many are  portraying this as a serious issue comparable to civil rights activism. I agree that it's trivial nonsense and doesn't rate this level of response or attention. \n\n&gt; Except she backed down out of fear that someone in the audience would get hurt not herself.\n\nHow noble of her. If this is the appropriate response, shouldn't Barack Obama have cancelled his campaign appearances? \n\n&gt; He didn't hide, because he has a bunch of armed guards who were there to protect him. Anita Sarkeesian doesn't have that....\n\nAt Utah State she would have had dozens of police and armed guards protecting her.\n\nIt's her call if she chose not to do that particular event.\n\n&gt; So? That's an entirely different situation and scenario. It's not relevant here, in this conversation.\n\nIt's relevant because clinic access is a legitimate women's rights issue and whining about Princess Peach is not. People like Sarkeesian cheapen civil rights struggles. \n\nAnd as much as I hate the pro-life slimebags, they aren't really \"misogynistic\". They don't actually hate all women, despite what some might say. They simply have a political belief that has negative affects on women (and men, and children). \n\nI think the \"hate all women\" label is being tossed around far too casually. \n\n&gt; Jack Thompson didn't get very specific threats threatening to shoot up a place he was going to speak at, which would have allowed guns via open carry. So it's not a comparable situation.\n\nHe received constant death threats. Complaining that the situation isn't 100% exactly the same is just evading the point that all kinds of people and groups receive death threats and they don't allow that impede their activism. The Westboro Baptist Church loonies get constant death threats (and murder attempts, people shoot at them all the time) and they're still out protesting funerals. \n\nYou know what's actually irrelevant here? The threats and harassment. \n\nBeing threatened didn't prove Jack Thompson was right. \n\nBut Sarkeesian's supporters seem to argue that *because* she's being harassed that proves that gaming is sexist and gamers are misogynistic. No it doesn't. \n\n&gt; Except despite all the threats she's still doing what she's doing. \n\nThen she should stop talking about the threats, ignore the trolls, respond to her critics, and move on. \n\nTrolls are gonna troll. Trying to *silence* the trolls just creates a Streisand Effect and makes *more* trolls. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmjdofr", "body": "The feminist cause isn't to manufacture rape culture or \"prove\" that some women are harassed/some men harass women.

The narrative for almost all mainstream coverage of these women  universally supports them, and an inordinate portion of these articles focuses on harassment from a small group of psychopaths and trolls, which usually includes quotes of some of the most tasteless comments for shock value. Because of this, I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much, I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake, anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this, while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women, I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

All someone who wanted to discredit people who disagree with Sarkeesian and Quinn would need to do is create an anonymous twitter account and say they want to rape them.\n\n\nI think that considering the possible motivations behind online commenters is important. For instance, if I were to read the comments on a Chinese news article, I wouldn't take everything at face value because there are government agencies in China dedicated to getting people to make pro government comments anonymously. However, there is no way I could prove that \u4e01\u6960 was working for the Chinese government.\n\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that there are many, many trolls writing horrible things about these women and they outnumber any feminist false flaggers greatly.

I don't need to prove that each individual person made a fake comment if we assume that people respond to incentives (hundreds of years of social science says they do). There are thousands of hard core supporters for these women who have been presented with an easy way to help their cause at no cost to themselves.

When you stop to think about it, it's a little bit absurd.  We equip police officers with this tool that they are only supposed to use in the most extreme circumstances, and even when they use it justifiably they come under extremely intense scrutiny.  It's a set-up for controversy and failure.  \n\nSecondly, is there something inherently less effective about non-lethal weapons, such as mace, tazers, beanbag guns, tear gas, etc.?  This is where I'll confess my ignorance, I don't know much about guns and weapons, but it seems to me that these things are all just as good at incapacitating somebody.  How necessary is it for officers to have lethal capability?  Maybe there's a deterrence factor, but aren't all these recent police shootings evidence that deterrence often fails with tragic results?\n\nFinally, is there any reason why a separate force equipped specifically to respond to armed threats would be ineffective?  Again, I recognize there are big hurdles in terms of manpower and cost.  On the other hand, how much money is wasted on the legal battles that ensue nearly every time a police officer draws his firearm?  \n\nJust so you know, my mind can definitely be changed on this, I don't have all the pieces together in my head and I suspect there is some reason why this sort of arrangement wouldn't work.  Change my view!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who responded (or is still responding).  The consensus seems to be that the non-lethal (less lethal) technology just isn't there, but I have yet to be convinced that there is any more fundamental reason why lethal threats must be addressed with lethal force.  So, a hypothetical follow-up prompt for those still following this thread:  if non-lethal (less lethal) weapons were available and effective at disarming armed criminals, would you still prefer police officers to be armed with actual firearms?  What if the non-lethal weapons were only slightly less effective than firearms?  At what point would they be worth using?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I had an instructor who was an officer part time and his take on mace was \"Well you've got this pissed off guy making a scene and threatens you, so you mace him.  Now you've got a *really* pissed off guy who's actually going to carry though with that threat\".  Mace simply doesn't stop an attacker, it only blinds them and pisses them off.\n\n - Tasers:  few follow up shots (if any), very limited range, sometimes sketchy effectiveness.  If someone is wearing a coat or is moving quick enough to only allow a single dart contact then the taser won't work.\n\n - Bean Bags:  limited range, not terribly accurate, can still cause a ton of potentially damage at close ranges.  You also need a long-gun to use it, and your average patrol cop usually doesn't carry one within arms reach at all times.  A pistol on a holster is going to be faster every time.\n\n - Tear Gas:  This is an area weapon, so you're going to have lots of collateral damage.  Also has the same drawbacks as mace concerning getting angry people more angry and not really disabling them.  Also requires a form of long-gun to use, or carry grenades.  \n\n&gt; Finally, is there any reason why a separate force equipped specifically to respond to armed threats would be ineffective?\n\nWell, this is what SWAT is for and they're usually very effective.  However for the crucial first moments of an altercation you need people armed and ready to hold a threat until someone better armed comes in to back you up.\n\nBasically what it comes down to is response time.

You generally want people to leave when you gas them. "}, {"id": "2o3gkr", "body": "My friend actually had this idea, and I couldn't think of any reasons why it wouldn't be a good solution...at least hypothetically, I do see all the logistical hurdles in terms of paying for and training two separate police forces.  \n\nFirst off, why do your day-to-day patrol officers need lethal firearms?  When you stop to think about it, it's a little bit absurd.  We equip police officers with this tool that they are only supposed to use in the most extreme circumstances, and even when they use it justifiably they come under extremely intense scrutiny.  It's a set-up for controversy and failure.  \n\nSecondly, is there something inherently less effective about non-lethal weapons, such as mace, tazers, beanbag guns, tear gas, etc.?  This is where I'll confess my ignorance, I don't know much about guns and weapons, but it seems to me that these things are all just as good at incapacitating somebody.  How necessary is it for officers to have lethal capability?  Maybe there's a deterrence factor, but aren't all these recent police shootings evidence that deterrence often fails with tragic results?\n\nFinally, is there any reason why a separate force equipped specifically to respond to armed threats would be ineffective?  Again, I recognize there are big hurdles in terms of manpower and cost.  On the other hand, how much money is wasted on the legal battles that ensue nearly every time a police officer draws his firearm?  \n\nJust so you know, my mind can definitely be changed on this, I don't have all the pieces together in my head and I suspect there is some reason why this sort of arrangement wouldn't work.  Change my view!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who responded (or is still responding).  The consensus seems to be that the non-lethal (less lethal) technology just isn't there, but I have yet to be convinced that there is any more fundamental reason why lethal threats must be addressed with lethal force.  So, a hypothetical follow-up prompt for those still following this thread:  if non-lethal (less lethal) weapons were available and effective at disarming armed criminals, would you still prefer police officers to be armed with actual firearms?  What if the non-lethal weapons were only slightly less effective than firearms?  At what point would they be worth using?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

A winter coat can stop a TASER. OC spray won't stop a determined -or high- person. Bean bag guns/tear gas require specialized equipment and you run into similar problems. NONE of these things are useful when a man with a gun, or hell, a KNIFE, is running at you trying to kill you. We are in a profession where we deal with criminals on a day to day basis- I'd say we deserve a chance at protecting ourselves. "}, {"id": "cmjjzto", "body": "I'm a cop.
