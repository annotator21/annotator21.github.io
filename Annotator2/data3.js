Also, it isn't really fair to clump the concern into just the probability of death. What about the probability of getting sick or even going into anaphylactic shock? Those are also likely concerns whose individual statistics we should also address.  "}, {"id": "cmy28me", "body": "Here is a stat on fatalities related to [buses](http://www.schoolbusfleet.com/channel/school-bus-safety/news/2012/09/18/nhtsa-updates-school-transportation-crash-stats.aspx).\n\nHere is an [article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/meredith-broussard/food-allergy-deaths-less_b_151462.html) that contains figures on fatalities due to allergies. \n\nSorry for the wait. My daughter just got home from school. You make an excellent point about my factoring *only* the probability of death. Yet, I wonder what the figures would look like if we factored in life long trauma from accidents as well. "}, {"id": "2pmhiw", "body": "You will have to excuse my callousness on some of these examples. I am trying to look at the issues logically and not passionately. \n\nI am talking about things like the new \"glutton free\" trends or the panic over peanut allergies VS. the obesity epidemic or vehicle related deaths. We *know* that more people will die from being overweight than from allergies, but there is more media and social attention spent on things that, in reality, only matter to a very small portion of society while we all but ignore the ugly truths that have an impact on *far* more people. \n\nTo further the example: From the numbers I have found, maybe 150-200 individuals in the nation this year will die from an allergic reactions to food. This includes **ALL** allergic reactions to **ALL** age ranges. However, children are not allowed to bring *anything* containing peanuts to school out of some paranoia that a child might come into contact and die from anaphylaxis. Statistically, a child has an equal probability of being killed in a bus accident as dying from a peanut butter sandwich, yet there has been no national campaign to end buses or really change them at all.\n\nHere is a bigger issue: We *know* more people died as a result of smoking, driving, over eating, and gun related injuries than from any domestic terrorist action annually (even in 2001), so why have we spent trillions to \"keep America safe\" on something that has only had an effect on so few? If we had spent the same amount of money on any of these other issues we likely would have lowered the preventable deaths in this country significantly. \n\nThere *are* big issues out there, and they *do* get attention. However, there are also a lot of trumped up issues that are statistically less of a problem than their supporters would have you believe. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So it doesn't really make sense that one partner loses their family name while the other retains theirs. It seems the most logical solution would be to combine the names (often done through a hyphen) although this is cumbersome, or create a brand new name for both partners to adopt. Obviously the simplest way of doing things is to just pick a name and go with it, whether that means creating a new one or just accepting one of the partner's family names. \n\nThe suggestion that picking a name be based at all on gender is frankly offensive. Whatever the reason the name that is picked should be a mutual decision that both partners are happy with. If you don't mind changing your name that's a perfectly acceptable personal decision.

My new solution is to blatantly push the arms down now. Does it make me an asshole in that moment? Sure. There's an equally reasonable expectation of me doing that to those who choose to record.

To what extent are they allowed to impose those recording devices?

Thought I'd submit this post because it's something that has been bugging me a bit since going to a concert in October. It's the obnoxious amount of phones I see being pulled out and *held up* forever because ravenous fans decide to record entire songs on their phones or ipads(that takes a special kind of audacity).\n\nOverall, I do sincerely believe this is an incredibly stupid thing to do.\n\n1) No matter how good the camera on your phone or hand-held device, the quality will be garbage. You really think those speakers of yours will pick up the awesomeness of the moment or sound? Even in HD, the videos uploaded are garbage and both eye and ear sores. I liked that song, but not when it sounds like that..\n\n2) It's obnoxious to other concert goers. Yes, if the venue doesn't ban them, you are free to do it. But in exercising your freedom, you are imposing on the freedom of others. We as fans paid good money for tickets to see our favorite musicians show us a good time and entertain us. I didn't pay to see some jackasses hold up a rectangles. I sure as hell didn't pay to see the artist through your damn lens either.\n\n3) This one is more anticipatory for a possible counter-argument of there was no other way for people to see it. Guess what? If you didn't pay the dough, know about the gig, or couldn't catch it, you're not automatically entitled to seeing it. You're not the first person to miss an event, and you surely won't be the last.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Consider Loving v Virginia, the case that made anti miscegenation laws illegal, it was probably too early for the US, It took another 25 years for the US populace to finally reach 50% acceptance of interracial marriage. To pretend that NO conservatives supported the decision, in general, but were more concerned that it was too early for the sans culottes to accept it, is disingenuous.

See you at Christmas!\" I don't think either is as good a system as every child inheriting a single last name.\n\nThe exact same thing is happening in your proposition. People have to arbitrarily decide which grandparents' names to lop off. \n\nSo you have Mr Miller and Ms Jonson and they choose to name their kid Mr Jonson. On the other side, you have Mr Jonson and Mr Stevens and their child Ms Franklin.  When Mr Miller and Ms Franklin have a kid; they still have to choose and they still have the \"Sorry Grandma Jonson, you didn't make the grandkid 's name cut. See you at Christmas\" convo. Only difference is you are now cutting 3 grandparents and you don't have to tell Grandpa Stevens at Christmas because he was cut off at the first round. \n\nETA a TL;DR: A simple family name is a random lop off after the first one.

However, it is also there for some very good reasons. Trolls and angry posts/comments happen on the internet. Shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

The internet is a rough place and Reddit is much nicer than most online forums/comments and the downvote plays a huge part in that.\n\nIt's different in CMV because people are here to openly discuss things and the rules are that you have a back and forth so people are willing to allow opinions they disagree with go. But then places like /r/politics you have people who don't want pro-Republican thoughts expressed and they use the downvote differently. Both cases they are using the downvote button to shape the culture of their subreddit and that seems fine to me.\n\nIf you can come up with a better system then I could CMV but simply getting rid of the downvote isn't it.

It removes the influence that others might have on you in regards to your opinion about the certain post.\n\nNow I think downvoting is needed for a lot of communities, and in others it could be removed. \n\nTake for example I'm a Buffalo Bills fan and I subscribe to the /r/buffalobills sub. The community mostly consists of Bills fans and we discuss all that there is to talk about the Bills. Now if a Patriots fan decides to enter in on the conversation and is doing so in a negative way, we should have the right to drown out their comment. If we didn't have that right, it would hurt the community and the substance of many of the discussions that are had. \n\nNow take /r/politics for example, and over there the community is so large that the mob mentality takes more of an effect. What I mean is that /r/politics is supposed to be absent of bias (it's called politics not democrats or republicans) but certain posts will be censored by the majority (the mob). The censoring actually occurs by both the community and the moderators, and I agree that it does more to hurt the community than help it. In places like that I would suggest that a downvote button be removed.\n\nI think it helps certain communities and hurts others, and we shouldn't employ a universal application of the downvote button.

In those cases where there are very good, well though out comments are downvoted it is because they are in the wrong place.\n\nYou shouldn't go to r/atheism for a reasoned discussion about the reason that a given person is Christian. That's not the function of the sub. There are other subs for that, so even though the conversation might be good in a vacuum when it is put in that specific context then it is simply noise. Downvoting in this case is useful to the community but not so much for the poster or that specific conversation.\n\nIt's important to realize that the subs with the best content to noise are those that have the most restrictive rules. Just look at r/askhistorians. If you want a good answer then you will get a good answer, but they often end up deleting dozens of comments that would be perfectly good just about anywhere else. There is a serious trade off there, while they sacrifice some decent opinions they ensure that people reading get good answers, and only good answers.\n\nIn a more general sense I disagree with the notion that someone should \"like it or just move on\". Often times a seemingly good opinion is either factually incorrect or founded on poor logic, but sitting down and explaining is unlikely to have a payoff or would be damaging to the community as a whole and yet letting the comment stand unaddressed might mislead or be similarly damaging to the community. For me a downvote is useful because it allows for the middle way that doesn't involve me calling someone out on their opinion and inviting unnecessary drama, help hide factually incorrect information without having to dig up relevant citations to \"prove\" the point to someone who is emotionally invested in their statement being accurate, and allows me to help moderate the conversation by making low effort, off topic, or intentionally disruptive comments less prominent.\n\nI've been on the wrong end of people downvoting my opinions before, but things like that happen. Usually it's a simple case of my commentary being out of place or there being hard to explain logic errors, rarely it is simply because my argument is unpopular at the moment. Still these things happen, and figuring out why I am being downvoted has made me a significantly stronger poster in CMV.

On the other hand, I really, really like the Hobbit movies in 45 FPS and 3D. The high frame rate minimizes motion blur and makes the 3D look great and the action sequences clear and gorgeous, I feel like action in 3D movies often looks like confusing nonsense and a big part of that is probably motion blur."}]}
