ISIS? The Boko Haram? Republicans?The Tea Party? Green Peace? Who falls under your spectrum as a radical?\n\nReligious hate groups like the West Boro Batpist Church, Jesus camps or anything similar in any other religion. Islamists are a great example of a noxious right wing religious ideology.\n\nOther than that there are neo-conservatives that are very similar to these groups; and spread the same politics of fear; the erosion of cultural values and going to war as a sort of crusade against an exaggerated evil for personal gains.\n\nRepublicans or the Tea party don't really fall under the radical far right.\n\n&gt;Furthermore what does restrict communications even mean? You mean delete all Facebook posts by Boko Haram?\n\nWell think of it this way - groups like ISIS get a lot of recruits off twitter and facebook. Young and stupid people who end up becoming cannon fodder for Islamist leaders. I think the state should clamp down on this kind of \"free speech\". People *are* gullible, and this sort of thing can be prevented.\n\nI totally realize that it's unrealistic for surveillance to be everywhere. I do understand that governments do monitor their citizens too. I just believe they can do a bit more - far-right radicals don't deserve free speech imo.\n\n&gt;Look at the US, they had the most complex and extensive surveillance apparatus in the world, and all it took was a pair of dickheads and a pressure cooker to paralyze Boston.\n\nYes, but you can still put a huge dampener on their activities. It's just shocking how many young people from the West go to fight for ISIS, and I think more should be done to stop this from happening.\n\nAgain, the same can be said of many far-right radical groups. Often they even sink their tentacles into right-wing political parties and are allowed just a little bit more wiggle-room when right-wing parties are in power (of course I bet the same thing probably happens when a left of center party is in power too).\n\n"}, {"id": "cmph140", "body": "I would suggest making such groups illegal, and using the police to clamp down on them much more harshly.

I think the human tendency to name things is a problem with the aforementioned traits because they are a lot more complicated than a single word. If one goes onto almost any post in this /r/ about atheism, there's probably going to be someone arguing about the definition, and agnosticism, etc. As I said, religion, and lack thereof, is complicated. For example, my beliefs; (the length of the text is what matters, you don't *have* to read it):\n\n*I don't believe in any deity or afterlife, because I don't see enough evidence to support it. Of course, I don't deny the possibility of one, but I don't deny the possibility of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. I was raised a Roman Catholic and stopped believing around the age of eleven, when Stephen Hawking let me know that there was no need for one. For  one year, when I was thirteen, I 'decided' to believe because believing in God and the afterlife is easier, and less scary. After this period, I decided to stop lying to myself. I sometimes compare religion to Megalodon in the present day; because of what a person/group said, some people believe in it, even if there is no strong evidence. The main difference is the intentions of the person/group; one being significantly more benign than the other. I tolerate people's religions up to the point where they 1) try to convince someone, be they a child or YouTube commenter, of their religion (that applies to atheists too) or 2) deny hard science because of their beliefs, or 3) make politics or schools or whatever non-secular, because this alienates and ignores the existence of 'the other'.*\n\nThis, or:\n\n*I'm an atheist.*\n\nAnd of course, the word atheist comes with baggage; a picture that comes into many people's minds when they hear that word is a person who hates all theists and considers them idiots, which I do not. There is a similar problem with things like feminism, because of the whole SJW hoo-haa.

While religion can be described with an explanation, I think that sexual orientation (and perhaps gender, I'm not as well learned when it comes to that kind of stuff) is best described with a diagram, consisting of a bunch of spectrums. This can be fairly easily described with words. For example, attractiveness matters around 40% to me, likability is 85%, and I'm 90% heterosexual. Some people may not be sure of some of these, and I'd suggest having a range in which the percentage may be; for example, attractiveness matters 40% to me within a range of 20%. I know that this system is far from perfect, but I think it's better than \"I'm a heterosexual to whom likability matters a bit more than usual.\"\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n**EDIT 1** The main point I'm trying to convey here is the ineffectiveness of the singular words, not bias.\n\n\n**EDIT 2** Sorry guys, but I might not be able to respond to all of you within three hours.

Much of the content surrounding this topic is hotly debated on Reddit, and is something that I've been thinking about for a long while now. Many of these ideas culminated a couple months back with everyone's favorite topic, GamerGate.  However, I wanted to let the passions surrounding GamerGate cool off a bit before posting this here for obvious reasons.\n\nI am constantly seeing people on the Internet labelled as SJW's when they raise a point about some social issue, leading to them being quickly written off.  The issues being brought up surrounding the GamerGate controversy were mostly either about gender in the videogame industry or the ethical concerns of game journalism.  I feel that writing off anyone's position by calling them a SJW skews our ideas of what social justice really is, which is holding us back from making social progress. \n\nIn my eyes, valid points were raised on both sides of the GamerGate discussion. I think that the games industry needs to be more welcoming to women, both through employing more women and providing better representation of women as characters, but from the other side of the argument, I think that ethical considerations in game journalism need to be taken more seriously. This is a simplification, obviously, but to be clear, this CMV isn't about GamerGate or picking sides, but the labeling of people who discuss social issues surrounding both GamerGate and larger conversations as well. \n\n\nI understand that the term \"Social Justice Warrior\" was coined to intentionally have a negative connotation, evoking an image of someone violently typing posts on Reddit and Tumblr saying, \"All men are evil! Let's kill the men!\" And there are plenty of people out there who advocate social positions that go against the status quo without actually understanding these ideas, simply because they feel they are being contrarian or \"edgy.\" I think these people are misinformed and not worth a minute of your time.  \n\nHowever, it seems that the labeling of people as SJW's has extended beyond describing someone who shouts ideas of social justice into the tubes without understanding these things.  Often I see the term being used to describe anyone who talks about any social issue, whether the poster has an understanding of the topic or not. The people throwing out the SJW accusations seem to use this as a defense to keep things the way they are and not have to engage in conversation about racial, gender, or identity issues in any meaningful way.  I've even seen people trying to talk about issues of race in America after the events in Ferguson be labelled as SJW's. \n\nI think the demonization of the term \"Social Justice Warrior\"  on the Internet is affecting the way people perceive any conversation about social issues, effectively demonizing the idea of \"social justice\" itself online.  \n\nWhat do you think?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Radical sections of various movements tend to the be louder part, and over time, the public comes to assume that the loudest people are the leaders. \n\nIn some ways, a term for radical Social Justice people is needed to differentiate between those who are truly trying to improve things, and those who are merely looking for an excuse to gain vengeance on those they deem enemies, in this case, privileged people. While SJW may not be the best term, it can be useful. \n"}, {"id": "cmpjzg2", "body": "The issue is that the term has been hijacked.

Much of the content surrounding this topic is hotly debated on Reddit, and is something that I've been thinking about for a long while now. Many of these ideas culminated a couple months back with everyone's favorite topic, GamerGate.  However, I wanted to let the passions surrounding GamerGate cool off a bit before posting this here for obvious reasons.\n\nI am constantly seeing people on the Internet labelled as SJW's when they raise a point about some social issue, leading to them being quickly written off.  The issues being brought up surrounding the GamerGate controversy were mostly either about gender in the videogame industry or the ethical concerns of game journalism.  I feel that writing off anyone's position by calling them a SJW skews our ideas of what social justice really is, which is holding us back from making social progress. \n\nIn my eyes, valid points were raised on both sides of the GamerGate discussion. I think that the games industry needs to be more welcoming to women, both through employing more women and providing better representation of women as characters, but from the other side of the argument, I think that ethical considerations in game journalism need to be taken more seriously. This is a simplification, obviously, but to be clear, this CMV isn't about GamerGate or picking sides, but the labeling of people who discuss social issues surrounding both GamerGate and larger conversations as well. \n\n\nI understand that the term \"Social Justice Warrior\" was coined to intentionally have a negative connotation, evoking an image of someone violently typing posts on Reddit and Tumblr saying, \"All men are evil! Let's kill the men!\" And there are plenty of people out there who advocate social positions that go against the status quo without actually understanding these ideas, simply because they feel they are being contrarian or \"edgy.\" I think these people are misinformed and not worth a minute of your time.  \n\nHowever, it seems that the labeling of people as SJW's has extended beyond describing someone who shouts ideas of social justice into the tubes without understanding these things.  Often I see the term being used to describe anyone who talks about any social issue, whether the poster has an understanding of the topic or not. The people throwing out the SJW accusations seem to use this as a defense to keep things the way they are and not have to engage in conversation about racial, gender, or identity issues in any meaningful way.  I've even seen people trying to talk about issues of race in America after the events in Ferguson be labelled as SJW's. \n\nI think the demonization of the term \"Social Justice Warrior\"  on the Internet is affecting the way people perceive any conversation about social issues, effectively demonizing the idea of \"social justice\" itself online.  \n\nWhat do you think?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Online \"social justice warriors\" have shown pretty clearly that their interest lies with condescending blog posts and jokes rather than actual progress. All of the groups that are dedicated to making real palpable progress in society aren't going to be called social justice warriors because they generally don't do the things that the people who are the target of this insult do (ie, go on reddit/tumblr/twitter/etc and complain vs. actively campaign with a real group for a real cause). And even if they were to be called social justice warriors, I doubt that they would suddenly say \"Darn, I guess I shouldn't keep trying to make progress. Let's pack it up and go home.\" Anyone who's really truly dedicated to making progress and actively does things to further their goals will not be deterred by namecalling, and is quite unlikely to be subjected to namecalling in the first place due to the fact that if they're actually making changes, they're not commenting on reddit threads in /r/adviceanimals or something. Is it rather silly to throw everyone under the large and vague SJW blanket all the time? Absolutely. Does it actually do anything? Doubtful.\n\nAnd some food for thought; is this not applicable on both ends of the spectrum, with any person who questions a rape story or supports the concept of innocent until proven guilty in the context of a rape trial being called a \"rape apologist\", or anyone who defends men/boys as a group being called an \"MRA\" (with the same negative implications used when the term \"SJW\" is used)? Terms like these, I think, don't really slow any progress down. Yes, they cause people to refuse to consider one's argument when it's been used or uses it as a way to refuse to consider one's argument. But anyone who would do that isn't doing it because of the word. If it wasn't \"SJW\" and \"MRA\", they'd invent new buzzwords. There will always be buzzwords people use to plug their ears with and shout \"LA LA LA I'M NOT LISTENING!\" This isn't a problem with words, it's a problem with people.\n\nEDIT: To make sure nobody reading this is confused (the OP specifically)-- I 100% agree that the term SJW is inappropriate, and that namecalling with it is bad. What I'm refuting here is the OP's claim that using it will hurt progress or equality. I believe that the things hurting progress and equality are not the buzzwords people throw at eachother. If, hypothetically, you were to obliterate the phrase SJW/social justice warrior from the vernacular of the internet, they would come up with a new term in a heartbeat and use that instead. The words don't matter at all. Though I do agree with you that the word's use isn't a good thing, I think the problem runs much deeper and that the words themselves are not what hurts progress/equality. The feelings and preconceived notions about a group that causes them to use these words are what hurts progress. Even if all of these annoying buzzwords were out of circulation, the feelings behind them would remain and progress still wouldn't be made."}, {"id": "2op15b", "body": "Hello, CMV'ers.

Much of the content surrounding this topic is hotly debated on Reddit, and is something that I've been thinking about for a long while now. Many of these ideas culminated a couple months back with everyone's favorite topic, GamerGate.  However, I wanted to let the passions surrounding GamerGate cool off a bit before posting this here for obvious reasons.\n\nI am constantly seeing people on the Internet labelled as SJW's when they raise a point about some social issue, leading to them being quickly written off.  The issues being brought up surrounding the GamerGate controversy were mostly either about gender in the videogame industry or the ethical concerns of game journalism.  I feel that writing off anyone's position by calling them a SJW skews our ideas of what social justice really is, which is holding us back from making social progress. \n\nIn my eyes, valid points were raised on both sides of the GamerGate discussion. I think that the games industry needs to be more welcoming to women, both through employing more women and providing better representation of women as characters, but from the other side of the argument, I think that ethical considerations in game journalism need to be taken more seriously. This is a simplification, obviously, but to be clear, this CMV isn't about GamerGate or picking sides, but the labeling of people who discuss social issues surrounding both GamerGate and larger conversations as well. \n\n\nI understand that the term \"Social Justice Warrior\" was coined to intentionally have a negative connotation, evoking an image of someone violently typing posts on Reddit and Tumblr saying, \"All men are evil! Let's kill the men!\" And there are plenty of people out there who advocate social positions that go against the status quo without actually understanding these ideas, simply because they feel they are being contrarian or \"edgy.\" I think these people are misinformed and not worth a minute of your time.  \n\nHowever, it seems that the labeling of people as SJW's has extended beyond describing someone who shouts ideas of social justice into the tubes without understanding these things.  Often I see the term being used to describe anyone who talks about any social issue, whether the poster has an understanding of the topic or not. The people throwing out the SJW accusations seem to use this as a defense to keep things the way they are and not have to engage in conversation about racial, gender, or identity issues in any meaningful way.

Literally everyone everywhere who holds political views on any topic believes in \"social justice,\" rendering is a meaningless term. If a conservative/liberal/libertarian/communist did not believe his or her political views to be \"just,\" he or she would hold different views. Therefore, saying one believes in \"social justice\" is as trite and meaningless as saying that one supports \"good governance\" and/or opposes \"evil.\"\n\nOf course, we all know what social justice really means. It's a buzzword used by the far left to describe their own views (ex. identity politics, wealth redistribution etc). My issue with this, is that it assumes without justification both that there is an objective standard of justice, and that the social views of the far left are objectively correct. This seems completely dishonest to me. Issues of ethics, morality and justice have been passionately debated for thousands of years without any sort of consensus being reached. Therefore, there is no rational basis to hijack the term \"justice\" to describe one's own views. Defining it in these terms without justification implies that your ideological opponents support injustice, bad governance, or evil, which is propaganda at best and outright dishonesty at worst.

This alters how the government functions so massively a comparison can't really be made.\n\nThe job of the Alaska state government is to spend oil tax revenue, including literally giving it away to the state's ~800,000 residents.  Compared to a state government like California, which has a vast and diverse economy, and over fifty times the population.  Its tax revenue comes from many sources, and many government initiatives must be passed by state-wide referendum.

While you can certainly make a case that you don't want to vote for a candidate without executive experience, that shouldn't be translated into a constitution.\n\nKeep in mind, the current constitutional requirements for being President are as follows:\n\n* Be 35\n\n* Be a \"natural born citizen\"\n\n* Have resided in the US for the prior 14 years.\n\nI have three main reasons why \"have been governor of one of the states\" shouldn't be a constitutional limit on who can run for President.\n\n1. **It is undemocratic.**  A core principle of representative government is that the leaders are chosen by the people.  Currently, there are probably 150 million + people who meet the current standards.  You'd be reducing it to something like 150.  I don't know exactly how many current and former living governors there are, but it can't be more than a thousand or so, and I suspect much less.  The people should not be limited to a very small list of potential candidates for the Presidency.  It's certainly fair to base your personal voting decision on resume, and encourage others to do so as well.  But that's a question of who to vote for, not who should be allowed to appear on the ballot.\n\n2. **It undervalues non-governor experience.**  There's a lot of experience that is valuable in governing that isn't being governor of a state.  For example, being a cabinet secretary provides a lot of experience.  Several Presidents were Secretary of State before becoming President (Jefferson, Adams, Monroe, Van Buren, and Buchanan).  Likewise, being a legislator, especially a legislative leader like Speaker of the House or Senate Majority Leader (such as LBJ) is an important role that gives you a lot of experience in the actual workings of governance.\n\n3. **It interferes in states' self governance**  To do this would be to effectively require that each state have a single governor, and that the governor have meaningful executive responsibilities. Some states split the job of governor among multiple people, giving them each some executive role.  For example, Texas has at least four statewide offices with some level of executive function, and it is generally the Lieutenant Governor who has the most formal executive power.

I do believe that the majority of people are, in fact, corrupt.

Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair, dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow, or rules that have no legitimate reason other than \"because I say so.\" (I'm not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the \"because I say so\" justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason, but sometimes parents don't actually have a reason other than \"I say so.\") However, you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children.
