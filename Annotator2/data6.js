You're walking down the street, and you see a knife lying on the ground. You have the choice to pick it up, or to keep walking. Both would be considered very reasonable actions to take. Do you leave it there, because it doesn't belong to you, for instance, or do you take it? If the wrong person found it, it could result in someone getting hurt. Whichever option you *choose*, you're making a *choice*.\n\nNow let's say you took the knife. A little ways down the street, you see someone getting mugged. It looks very likely that the victim will be seriously harmed in the process. The mugger doesn't see you. Do you use the knife to stop the mugging? Again, you're making a choice, even if you choose to keep walking. You're actively aware that something is going on, and that you can take action, but you choose not to.\n\nIf you didn't see the mugger, or didn't see the knife, you wouldn't have made a choice, because you were not actively aware of the options presented to you, but as soon as that option enters your awareness, you're making a choice, even if inaction is the choice you make, and even if that choice is subconscious.\n\nTherefore I assert that because you were aware that the option to change your name did exist - even if it didn't interest you - when you got married, you made the choice not to, even if that choice was inaction on your part.

In the actual pokemon games, although you can carry around 6 pokemon as a maximum, nobody battles you with six, and the standard battle spot settings only allow 3 pokemon for a 1v1 battle. What this makes clear is that your pokemon team isn't meant to exist in its entirety as a battling group-- the primary mechanic your pokemon are supposed to serve is companions, as trite as that may sound.

Your tyrannitar and salamance may be for beating the shit out of gym leaders, but maybe your golurk is just a pokemon you like the look of, and don't particularly care for as a battling 'mon. So it knows fly and strength and whatnot, and thus it still serves a /purpose/. I think Gamefreak has made clear through the way they manage their tournaments and battlespot rules that they don't care for the competitive scene, and pokemon for them is more of an emotional, and primarily aesthetic, endeavor. When you see it that way, HMs, despite their annoying mechanic of requiring the move deleter to get rid of, serve a critical purpose: they elevate the pokemon that gamefreak has made adorable but hopelessly weak important by carrying you on their back across perilous terrain.

Is it just that you don't want to do it, or that it serves little to no purpose?  For instance, I find grinding to be an unnecessary barrier in the pokemon games.  It takes far too many battles for me to advance my pokemon, and it can easily fixed by simply quadrupling XP payouts and putting the bosses on scaling difficulty so they match your pokemon's levels.  However, that would be mean there's no effort in the game.  The game requires effort.  Similarly, the HM mechanic is one that makes the user jump through hoops, but has beneficial side-effects that make it worthwhile.\n\nThe HM moves required to advance through the games have two effects:\n\n1)  Players must carry pokemon able to use the moves in order to access specific areas.\n2)  Players must use up one of four move slots on a given pokemon to use a HM move.\n\nYou suggest uniformly that this is bad, but you don't actually provide reasons for it.  \n\nYour reasons, as gleaned from your post:\n\n1)  Other items could perform this function.\n2)  The mechanic is a barrier to enjoyable play.\n\nThe idea that other items could perform this function by suggesting that while this is true, it would actually be a far *less* interesting game.  The items you've described present no challenge to players - they allow players to freely field a set of six pokemon with full sets of ideal move selections.  This means that in Gym battles, the core plot/completion-advancement mechanic, I have 6 more possible moves I can employ to perfectly counter the leader's type.  My move selections are much less interesting - I will always just choose the move type appropriate to the gym where possible.  Furthermore, this challenge makes your main squad from the single player game the same as an online team you craft - it takes away the personal nature of using pokemon to complete the game, and then raising your ideal squads for online play.  With your suggestion, I would mostly likely include many more of my single player mains in the online game - while certainly this makes it \"easier\" to get into online play, you have erased a colorful and creative challenge that the game gives its users.  By the same token, it seems like you would want the Move Deleter to be accessible from the get go - but does full, unbounded control over your pokemon's moves make a more interesting game?  I would argue not.  \n\nOn the flipside, instead of being a barrier to enjoyable play, the idea that you must mold your pokemon team around this particular \"moveset geography\" means that each player must make creative, strategic choices when they level and advance their pokemon.  For instance, when I've been relying a certain set of pokemon, and I know I'm going to get to the next gym, but that I need someone with Rock Smash, if my team doesn't have a rock-smash capable pokemon, I am required to learn the ins-and-outs of a new pokemon; which is what the game is about, right?  Documenting all the pokemanz?  Having to take a moment to choose my new pokemon  causes me to develop a relationship with it as a player through increased usage.  Without that moment, without that switchup, I would only be changing pokemon as Type dictates - which is already something I do.  By the end of most of my games, only a small troop of my pokemon can actually go up against the Elite 4 - imagine how much smaller it would be if you were never forced to branch out in the limited way you already do?  Imagine how much more grinding you might need to do (yeah, I know pokemon is a grinding game...) because you've only leveled the 8 pokemon you like best, using 2 as flex pokemon for type constraints.  Far less interesting, far less investment in your other pokemon.\n\n"}, {"id": "2piioi", "body": "In the main series of Pok\u00e9mon games, Pok\u00e9mon can learn certain moves that allow the trainer to perform special actions outside of battle. These include surf, which allows you to travel on water, and fly, which allows you quickly travel between areas. The problem with these is that Pok\u00e9mon can only learn 4 moves at a time. Most of these moves cannot be replaced easily like others can.\n\nThis means that players either have to sacrifice one of these moves or carry around a Pok\u00e9mon specifically for these moves. This is an unnecessary barrier. The only reason these field moves were introduced is to structure progress throughout the Pok\u00e9mon region and the only reason they remain is tradition. Items could just as easily serve the same function, as they do in several fan games such as /r/pokemonzetaomicron. In ORAS, the move fly already has a replacement that solves this issue."}, {"id": "cmyfbgs", "body": "I understand where you are coming from on this one, but I also disagree for one main reason. Pokemon is an RPG, a *role playing game* with the intention that you experience the world, and its rules through the avatar that is the player character.\n\nThe game requires fidelity, both to its own ethos and to *your life*\nmind you we are talking about a game where supposed adolescents are free to roam the world unmonitored, and capture wild animals and fight with them.\n\n However, as derivative or 'unrealistic' as pokemon is the game needs to encompass all aspects of your life in some way, or you would most likely find it unrewarding as a role playing experience. \n\nSpecifically in this case, the inconveniences of everyday life. You encounter them all the time, and they grind your gears. Maybe your internet is out, or you're hungry and the fridge is empty.\n\nThese types of scenario's generally have a simple solution. This solution requires patience, or some resource you have or don't have and need to acquire first.\n\nCalling up your ISP, for example is a pain in the butt, I hate it and so do you I imagine. They might not help you at all, or they might say they are having an outage and you have to wait it out.\n\neither way, is it not satisfying in some way when the internet comes back on? for whatever reason? Is there not the relief of annoyance or distress, maybe even some pleasure to be had?\n\nWhat does this have to do with Pokemon and HM's? well imagine a game where you had all the HM abilities out of the gate. Your character can suddenly chop down small trees, or teleport to wherever, and walk on water. \n\nThat game sounds boring, too easy, that game is not pokemon.\n\nEverything in the game is part of the experience, and attempts to encapsulate familiar experiences in some way. Albeit paired down, or simplified in some obvious way, as real life is more nuanced. But still the point is, facets of any game like HM's or the rarity of a pokemon for example are built in to deliver an experience that balances tension and release in a way that keeps you coming back.\n\nYou hop on your flying pokemon and instantly move to some city you have business in for the first time in a new game. It might go unnoticed but a feeling is there whilst you play.\n\nThe quiet \"ah thats nice\" or \"Man thats so much better than before\" in the back of your mind\n\nAnd those moments, no matter how obvious are integral to a good immersive game. Things can't be too easy, or too hard. They gotta have that balance.\n\nNow HM's might not be integral to the balance, maybe the game can create those cycles of tension in other ways, **but here is that real mind bomb waiting to blow up in your head.**\n\n**What do you complain about in real life?** the stupid illogical annoyances you perceive are unnecessary or could be improved on. Your ISP could have better call center service, or do maintenance on the cable lines before they get so bad that people complain. But thats part of life.\n\nthats part of pokemon\n\nadditionally you might interject that you don't play pokemon for the role playing experience, but again thats what it is intended to be. Thats motherfucking pokemon.\n\n**tl;dr HM's are a part of a larger mechanization that is designed to create a cycle of tension, similiar to real life. Because it is meant to be a roleplaying game.**\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2pi2xh", "body": "I think for the most part there is a ton of negative activities and press surrounding Greek life (particularly Frats).

As a fraternity member myself, one who has volunteered and raised money for charity in my time as a brother (along with the rest of my house), it really pains me to see these kind of negative and unfair views on the Greek system becoming so popular. The fact is that most of the people who campaign against fraternities are basing their complete understanding of the topic on the way they're portrayed in movies (homophobic, alcoholic, misogynistic, etc.). Coming from the point of view of someone who knows firsthand how much good the Greek life can do for those in it as well as the university community as a whole, it's very disheartening.\n\nI'd just like to respond to one more of OP's points:\n\n&gt; And finally, and this really pertains more to the frats... but why are these so important to keep around?

I would need extensive logic explaining how frats are more than just boys clubs that have been around for too long.\n\nGoing away to college is a huge time in life. For many, it's the first time they've lived on their own, the first time they've been away from family, friends, their hometown, whatever. It's at once a massively high pressure yet largely unstructured environment. You have tons of shit that you have to do, yet no one is making you do any of it. Many, many people have a very hard time adjusting to that. Becoming a member of a fraternity or sorority is hugely beneficial in terms of creating a social support structure for those who may not have one at this key time in life, and creating friendships and mentorships. The senior members of the house take responsibility for helping the younger members adjust to their new environment through the big brother/sister system, and are generally hugely beneficial in teaching the younger members how to navigate college life safely and effectively. As others have pointed out, graduation rates are significantly higher among Greek letter organization members than the general university population.\n\n/u/deathproof-ish, with all respect I believe you have an extremely misinformed understanding of Greek life and what it entails.

So in your example of it being accomplishable outside of Greek Life... you're right, but it won't be as effective. A single autonomous group deciding to better their community in whatever way they feel their community needs to be bettered is going to be more effective than a couple guys signing up to work as a soup kitchen. Or at the very least, it'll be effective in a different way, since the soup kitchen will exist with or without them but the fraternity/sorority can focus on things that are present within their specific community, that no one else is working on.\n\nFurthermore, there's an incentive for the fraternity members to do it while there may not be otherwise. When you have half your fraternity telling the other half to get off their asses and go help the community-- and more importantly, to do it with your friends while having fun-- you'll get a lot more people than hoping each of those individuals decide on their own to go help.\n\nSecondly, I'd love to prove that media hype involving Greek life is overblown, but you're going to have to show me what media hype there is, first. I really very strongly think that 1) in popular media (tv shows and movies), \"frat\" life is a scape goat and 2) in the news, it's often misrepresented. But I can't say how unless you give me specific examples.\n\nAnd even then-- yes, bad things sometimes happen at frats. But bad things happen everywhere, too. Throw into this that frats are one of the biggest social aspects in many campuses and it should follow that many of the \"bad things\" socially that happen, often happen at frat parties. This is one of the traps the media likes to lure you into-- yes, bad things happen at frat parties because that's where most of the *things* happen. News stories love to point out that something bad happened \"at a frat party\" without telling you it had absolutely nothing to do with the frat. That's just where most of the people go for parties.\n\nAnd here's the thing-- if the frats weren't there, those people would just go somewhere else. They wouldn't cut down on the bad things happening, it'd just be harder to pinpoint them to specific locations.\n\nWhat I will say, though, is that greek life is *so prevalent and widespread* in America-- you have to look at it statistically. So many of those frats and sororities *aren't* bad, but there's just so many of them that some of them are going to be bad. This doesn't mean the system is inherently wrong, it just means the system is inherently *big.* It's like the police brutality situation-- there are *so many cops* out there that some of them are assholes. Should we ignore that? No, we should try and fix the problem of cops being assholes. Should we just get rid of cops altogether? Of course not.\n\nThere's nothing inherent about greek life that makes it bad.\n\nBut what makes it good?\n\nWell, the charity and volunteer work I mentioned earlier, for one thing. For another, it's a social club. It's a place for people to go to and make friends. What's wrong with that? College is a place where a lot of people are unsure about themselves, maybe a little shy and just entering a new world while often knowing *no one.* What's so bad about a place that says hey, come hang out with us. See if you like us. We're good people, we'll be accepting of you, and if you think you like us too we can all hang out. Do you like to have parties to meet new people? We do too, so let's all chip in some money to pay for it. Do you like to go to nice dinners to celebrate, or to meet older, wiser people who can help guide you through college and life? We do too, so let's all chip in for that dinner. Do you like to hold events, for charity or publicity or just for fun? Do you like cheap on-campus housing? We do too, so let's all chip in for that. We'll call that chipping in \"dues,\" and if we all pay a little bit every year we'll get to do a lot of cool stuff.\n\nIt's a social club. No one has to join, but it's a huge benefit for a lot of people. It has this stigma of \"buying friends,\" and maybe in some cases that's true, but most of the time-- no one forces a rush to pledge a frat, no one forces a frat to accept a pledge. It's one person meeting a group of people, deciding if they want to hang out with them more, and if they do, everyone pools their money and their time and their effort to help everyone else out."}, {"id": "2pi2xh", "body": "I think for the most part there is a ton of negative activities and press surrounding Greek life (particularly Frats).

By your hazing argument, we shouldn't just ban greek organizations. We should ban hazing organizations. That includes acapella groups, comedy troupes, the Quidditch teams, marching band, and even, at my school, the student-led campus tour groups. [Even Princeton's Eating Clubs have been accused of rape.](http://www.businessinsider.com/princeton-eating-club-under-fire-for-allegedly-distributing-photo-of-sex-act-gets-vandalized-2014-11) None of these groups including frats officially haze. I'm not saying that hazing is okay, but I don't think a blanket ban on Greeks is a solution for hazing. \n\n2. You may argue that these groups provide a function or service to the community, but I would say that utility is no greater than the community service and philanthropy provided by greeks. \"I personally believe this can be accomplished without the Greek system in place.\" How so? Can you tell me specifically of another way that hundreds of otherwise disinterested or minimally motivated men and women will be pushed into philanthropy and service? Fyi, most greek organizations have  required minimum service hours or philanthropic activities, not to mention that they know that doing good work improves their reputation. May not be the purest of intentions, but the results are the same. \n\n2. You emphasize frats, and in doing so you are marginalizing large numbers of greek organizations that do not fall under your generalizations. For example most sororities do not systematically promote sexual harassment or rape. There also exist multicultural Greeks, which in addition to service and philanthropy are often dedicated to hosting leadership workshops, racial discussion seminars, cultural showcases, and scholarships for minority members of the community. I would consider all of these programs enhance the experience of the college community because they offer learning opportunities.\n\n3. You seek evidence that Greek life enhances the experience for non-greeks. I would consider it unreasonable for that to be a criterion for whether a student organization should exist. Does the knitting club benefit others? Does the Association of Engineers enhance student life for all? Or are you saying that criterion should only be applied when weighing the potential harm of an organization versus the potential benefit. I must say the potential harm of a greek organization is very hard to measure, and I would be against a University banning a frat arbitrarily, without any evidence. Decisions must not be based on rumors, however bad the rumors may be (see: Rolling Stone article on the UVa rape, accused frat Pi Psi, accusations revealed to be false). \n\n4. You asked for evidence that data is misrepresented or exaggerated. What data do you have? I'd like to see what numbers you're basing this opinion off of. Unless you can prove that a vast majority of Greeks clearly and unquestionably committed and/or supported abuse, eliminating the greek system is punishing all for the few.\n\n6. Finally, in response to another post you made that campuses should disaffiliate with Greeks: having affiliation allows the University to regulate. Minimum GPA, number of sexual assault and academic workshops attended by a majority of the Greek org, rules to prevent hazing such as limiting pledging periods, etc. Also, Universities have punishing power over affiliated groups. They can suspend an org from expansion as punishment for misdoings, or forbid them from having any alcohol on their premises.

I know about it at a very small school in a lame town where the fraternities really were the best place to be all the time. (Except for maybe the Alley on bowling nights). The media loves to drool indignant over a scandalous story originating from a Greek house somewhere.

A handful exist and to my knowledge have not caused any problems since they have been around. I am in a fraternity. \n\nBecause of the lack of Greek life compared to the other nearby universities, students here have turned their social attention towards other groups and clubs, which are just as large as any fraternity, charge dues, and throw parties as any fraternity at another school would do. Having visited and knowing students at universities with large numbers of Greek life students, I can attest to the fact that the culture is more less the same. A club which selectively allows members to join and charges a membership fee in my eyes is no different than a fraternity, except that it happens to also organize soccer tournaments, or make hamburgers to sell once a week. These are all things that a fraternity is capable of doing, and many students here are involved in (unofficial) Greek life and one of these clubs or organizations. \n\nI think the issues you discuss are the product of college party culture now, not necessarily fraternities or sororities.

I know this probably sounds counterintuitive, but my fraternity brothers were far more varied than the rest of my college friends. I was a poli-sci/econ major, and all my other extracurriculars (e.g., debate, Model UN) just exposed me to very similar people with similar academic interests, and many of those people continue to make up a good percentage of my best friends today. \n\nIt was only through my fraternity that I really got to spend real time with people whose life and academic interests were very different from mine - engineers, scientists, artists. The members of my fraternity were also all more varied when it came to their walks of life and political views than the rest of my friends, who were much more homogenous generally. \n\nI'm sure I theoretically could have sought out this diversity on my own, but a) I probably wouldn't have, and b) I probably wouldn't have actually invested nearly as much time in people who were different from me without being forced to spend time with them in my fraternity.\n\nThe second thing, which is more minor but I am still thankful for, is that I became *way* more handy than I was before college. Before joining my fraternity, I was always of the \"throw money at it\" or \"get someone else to fix it\" persuasion when it came to fixing things around my house. Those things weren't really an option in a fraternity, where everybody was expected to pitch in to maintain the house on a very limited budget, and there was always *plenty* to fix, given how old our house was and how many generations of rowdy young men had lived in it.\n\nI'm way more confident around basic tools than I would have been without my fraternity experience, and more self-sufficient as a result.

March Madness is a 3 week long tournament, which directly follows a week long conference tournament, that has players missing large amounts of school because of the travel and amount of games being played. Football players on the other hand will miss far less school because the games would be played during winter break. Remember that many student athletes stick around campus during winter break to workout and practice anyway. This excuse has been used by the NCAA for years but what they were always worried about is how to involve the bowls into a playoff format. The bowls are huge money makers for the NCAA and colleges and now that they have found a way to work those bowls into a playoff system the went ahead and finally created a playoff. \n\nThe other argument about injuries is more than fair.

I enjoy watching both games and the talent difference isn't really a factor for me.\n\nThe biggest advantage the NFL has for me is fantasy football. It's becoming a hugely popular thing and gets me engaged with players and teams across the board. This season the Falcons and the Gamecocks have been pretty lousy, but I was still plugged into watching the NFL because I had all these players I cared about. I had a reason to dive in and learn more about football and I know much more about what's going on with the different teams because of it. College ball just doesn't offer that opportunity, and there's way too many teams to keep track of.\n\nThe other thing I really like is getting to know players and following their careers. In college, they do well and break out for a couple of years, then they're drafted and a lot of them bust (Manziel and Tebow most recently). It's just not that interesting to follow.

I love the passion (which to be sure can be found in the NFL). The uniqueness of each school, and their at times wonderful histories, really can make it feel like you are a part of something special for a few hours.\n\nThere is also the huge variety to enjoy from power runs at UGA, to pass heavy Wazzu, to defensive minded teams like Michigan St. Sure the NFL has it to a degree, but the attempts at parity I feel undermine the inherent creativeness which flourishes in the college coaching ranks.\n\nYou also have the greater level of community engagement, from student bodies, to 80 year old alumni, to the bands, to the cheer squads, huge swaths of society can bond as alumni over it and I absolutely love that feeling even if it is a team Ive adopted for just a few hours. There is a reason a dozen colleges have stadiums larger than any NFL team, they must be doing something right to fill them up all the time with fewer games and more competition. \n\nBut I know that others feel just as strongly about the superiority of the NFL, so I would love to hear from them! Please I would be very interested in seeing a argument on in what ways the NFL puts a superior total product from on the field to the total fan experience.\n\nThank you and I look forward to possibly CingMV\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm very cynical and I think I've reached a point in my life where I don't want to be.  But I really don't see anything in this world that's worth fighting for.  So I just exist here, everyone else seems happy around me and good for them.\n\nThis is a generalization of things I see being a problem and I know some are very over-simplified, so forgive me that, but counter-arguments or some proof of change on each of these would be a nice change.\n\n**Waste (garbage, plastics, etc)**\n\nThere are so many garbage dumps, miles of garbage in the ocean, and polluted rivers, waterways, etc that eventually the earth will be just one big pile of garbage.  See Wall-E for an example of my views.  Sure we may eventually start a 'cleanup initiative' but it will be too late. \n\n**Pollution (C02, etc)**\n\nClimate change is happening and people deny it's existence.  The evidence is there but people don't like to accept things that go against their beliefs, no matter how much evidence you have.  Thus our planet is on course to be a planet devoid of any life without some intervention of us.\n\n**Wildlife**\n\nWe routinely don't care about animals going extinct.  People say 'its just a dumb animal' or whatnot, thankfully there are steps being taken here, but the ivory trade is going strong, tigers are going extinct, rhinos, etc.   We just can't help our greed and eventually we'll be reading about the last of each of those species dying off.\n\n**Cultural/Religious differences**\n\nI tell my friends I'm not racist at all, I'm more 'cultural-ist' if that's a thing.  I think middle-east culture should change, I feel they're still in the medieval ages like old Christians were.

The people in power just help themselves and do whatever it takes to stay there.\n\n**Overpopulation**\nAll in all, people are a plague on the world, we don't need this many people.  Even if half the world died,  thats still 3.5 billion people left.  We're really not hurting in the food chain even with halving the population.

Below is a list of things in no particular order that I have problems with, that I forsee causing the collapse of the human race as a species.  It may not be now, or 100 years from now, but I believe these all will contribute to a world in which I'm thankfully not going to be a part of.  I'm very cynical and I think I've reached a point in my life where I don't want to be.  But I really don't see anything in this world that's worth fighting for.  So I just exist here, everyone else seems happy around me and good for them.\n\nThis is a generalization of things I see being a problem and I know some are very over-simplified, so forgive me that, but counter-arguments or some proof of change on each of these would be a nice change.\n\n**Waste (garbage, plastics, etc)**\n\nThere are so many garbage dumps, miles of garbage in the ocean, and polluted rivers, waterways, etc that eventually the earth will be just one big pile of garbage.  See Wall-E for an example of my views.  Sure we may eventually start a 'cleanup initiative' but it will be too late. \n\n**Pollution (C02, etc)**\n\nClimate change is happening and people deny it's existence.  The evidence is there but people don't like to accept things that go against their beliefs, no matter how much evidence you have.  Thus our planet is on course to be a planet devoid of any life without some intervention of us.\n\n**Wildlife**\n\nWe routinely don't care about animals going extinct.  People say 'its just a dumb animal' or whatnot, thankfully there are steps being taken here, but the ivory trade is going strong, tigers are going extinct, rhinos, etc.   We just can't help our greed and eventually we'll be reading about the last of each of those species dying off.\n\n**Cultural/Religious differences**\n\nI tell my friends I'm not racist at all, I'm more 'cultural-ist' if that's a thing.  I think middle-east culture should change, I feel they're still in the medieval ages like old Christians were.  Some Christians still are, but everytime I hear about some father killing his daughter because she was raped is just asinine.  Or this morning's school raid by the Taliban for another example.\n\n**Politics and corruption**\n\nIt seems each country has it's own political issues.  From Mexico and police corruption/drug cartels, Russia invading other countries, Britains pedophelia scandal, Indias political corruption, America's political corruption, Australia and Tony Abott.  The people in power just help themselves and do whatever it takes to stay there.\n\n**Overpopulation**\nAll in all, people are a plague on the world, we don't need this many people.  Even if half the world died,  thats still 3.5 billion people left.  We're really not hurting in the food chain even with halving the population.  You and your children (mine included) are not special (to everyone else) and would have no impact on the world if they weren't here.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You can go almost anywhere in the world right now and there will be some form of human garbage there.  It will only get worse in the future unless there's some massive global wide 'garbage cleanup' initiative.  But we're always re-active instead of pro-active, and it won't happen for a while.\n\nPollution - sure we've made good strides towards cleaning up our air, but China (Beijing) and India (Kolkata) have very bad air pollution - hopefully that will clean up, but it will be a while with Chinas exploding industry.\n\nWildlife - sure we do make changes, and some animals have recovered from extinction thanks to laws and people, but there are many more that aren't and won't make it because they're not in the U.S.   We have our fair share of extincting things, and maybe it is a vast over-generalization to say that all endangered animals WILL go extinct, but I dont have high hopes for those that are high demand around cultures that are wanting them.  Sadly, those ones in high demand are some of the hardest to protect.\n\nCultural Differences - sure there aren't any world wars, but the middle east has been a war ground for a very long time.  And it doesn't have to be just wars either, obviously, some people don't like people that are different than them.  Could be skin color, sex, religion, political beliefs, etc.  People are mean to other people in general.  \n\nPolitics - I'd say Florida and their 'vote counting' to allow George Bush to be elected was a little wonky to say the least.   Also, if you're saying there isn't bribery going on in the U.S., I have no direct proof of that myself, but to say that it isnt wide-spread is wrong, when we have corporations lobbying senators, etc.  It happens, I'm fairly certain it does.  \n\nOverpopulation - The amount of people on the planet isn't necessary.  We procreate and procreate, for no other purpose than we're programmed to do it.

One thing we're good at doing is keeping ourselves alive.\n "}, {"id": "cmwrwt9", "body": "Waste - yeah, the Wall-E thing is a bit over the top, but the general idea is the same.  You can go almost anywhere in the world right now and there will be some form of human garbage there.  It will only get worse in the future unless there's some massive global wide 'garbage cleanup' initiative.  But we're always re-active instead of pro-active, and it won't happen for a while.\n\nPollution - sure we've made good strides towards cleaning up our air, but China (Beijing) and India (Kolkata) have very bad air pollution - hopefully that will clean up, but it will be a while with Chinas exploding industry.\n\nWildlife - sure we do make changes, and some animals have recovered from extinction thanks to laws and people, but there are many more that aren't and won't make it because they're not in the U.S.   We have our fair share of extincting things, and maybe it is a vast over-generalization to say that all endangered animals WILL go extinct, but I dont have high hopes for those that are high demand around cultures that are wanting them.  Sadly, those ones in high demand are some of the hardest to protect.\n\nCultural Differences - sure there aren't any world wars, but the middle east has been a war ground for a very long time.  And it doesn't have to be just wars either, obviously, some people don't like people that are different than them.  Could be skin color, sex, religion, political beliefs, etc.  People are mean to other people in general.  \n\nPolitics - I'd say Florida and their 'vote counting' to allow George Bush to be elected was a little wonky to say the least.   Also, if you're saying there isn't bribery going on in the U.S., I have no direct proof of that myself, but to say that it isnt wide-spread is wrong, when we have corporations lobbying senators, etc.  It happens, I'm fairly certain it does.  \n\nOverpopulation - The amount of people on the planet isn't necessary.  We procreate and procreate, for no other purpose than we're programmed to do it.  Even if that means encroaching on other habitats and species, but we don't care, because human life is worth more than a badger or something.   \n\nI'm not advocating murdering 3.5 billion people.

We as a species are retarded in that we deliberately destroy the things necessary for our own survival. And we destroy them just to make the rich a little bit richer... There is no arguing that, so the overall conclusion of your post stands.\n\nBut I'd argue the other points you make, some of which are totally misguided.\n\nPollution - we pollute the air, sure. But it has nothing to do with CO2, which is not a greenhouse gas in any meaningful way. At times the earth's atmosphere had way more CO2 than it has now, it's not like we humans make unprecedented changes to it (assuming we change it at all). You sadly believed the global warming propaganda that is an integral part of the political corruption you also mentioned. Of course the climate is changing, nobody doubts that - but earth's climate was never stable. It's stupid to expect the climate to stay the same for long periods of time, it never happened and never will. Saying that now humans cause this change is disingenuous. And the solution? The carbon tax. Right. Our mighty leaders will save the ever-changing climate from ourselves by creating another tax so they have more revenue... Why am I sceptical?\n\nThere would be no problems with religions or cultures if people would generally stay in their own cultures, not trying to bring it to places where it doesn't belong. People in the middle east should be able to have their distinct culture and religion, we should not interfere there politically or with armed forces. But at the same time they should not interfere with our cultures in our countries by the 'silent conquest' of immigration, slowly replacing native cultures in Europe. I know it's not politically correct to talk about this but fuck political correctness. The problem is not with religions *per se*, it's with exporting them to places where they are not wanted. I respect anybody's culture as long as they repay the favor by respecting mine. (But of course in our current political climate asking that people respect any culture of European origins is strictly forbidden because it's racism or whatever. Anything associated with whites must not be respected because whites are evil and worthless.)\n\nOverpopulation is a myth much like global warming. Sure, we could do with much less people, but the Earth could also support much more. If you gathered all the people in the world into a theatre where they could all sit comfortably (1 square meters each), they would take up less space than an average county in the US. If your answer is that producing food for these people takes up much more space, well, we should improve our methods of food production then, instead of creating a panic about 'overpopulation'.\n\nNot to offend you but some of your points are actually parts of the problem. We humans are gullible and easy to manipulate, we tend to believe anything which ties into our perceived self-worth. Come up with anything that will help people see themselves as holier than others and millions will follow you regardless of your idea being true or not. Global warming and overpopulation are typical examples of fads built on this premise. Do you feel like it's enlightened people believing in climate change and barbarians denying it?

The label was meant to express the notion that I was willing to pursue circumstances that were beneficial to me. Living in a capitalistic society (I'm from the U.S.) I believe that it benefits me to be this way, and should not be interpreted as a negative quality.\n\nThe argument against being an opportunist is that you are not a loyalist. Now granted their are things that you would want to be loyal to and not take the opportunity that may exist. Say for example the ability to date a friends ex, or being able to exploit someone for your own benefit. However, overall I think if you want to be successful in a capitalistic society you have to be an opportunist.\n\nThe whole concept of capitalism reflects around the notion that opportunity exists and is there for the taking. Those who do take it are the ones that are going to be successful. To try to suggest that these people are immoral for such actions is an unfair qualifier in a system that teaches us to be this way. \n\nBeing an immigrant further solidifies my belief that being an opportunist is a good thing. My family pursued the opportunity that the U.S. afforded them and took advantage of coming here and building a better life for themselves. I see no reason why they should have a negative feeling about this opportunity that they have taken, and I think we should motivate more people to be opportunists. That way they too can pursue circumstances that will help better their lives.\n\nIn regards to the new rule: I am looking for a reason why being an opportunist is considered a bad thing. I don't want a circumstantial response. Meaning I don't want scenarios in which opportunity should not be seized, as I have already conceded that those situations exist. However in regards to living a lifestyle of either seizing opportunities vs. not seizing them, I would like to understand why the latter would be considered better and why the former should be considered a negative quality. \n\nChange My View.\n\nP.S. If you don't believe this is a black and white issue, meaning there is no reason to be one or the other, and there should be a healthy blend of the two, then I would agree with you. I also don't think you would have the perspective that being an opportunist is a bad thing if you feel this way. Since I have been labeled this in a negative way, I'm looking to engage in discussions with people who truly believe that being an opportunist is a bad thing, be it for societal reasons, personal reasons or other reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So while you may end up \"Winning\" by being an opportunist, you may also end up alone.\n\nThe key, in my experience, is to gauge the cost of the opportunity versus the benefit. You must keep a level head and assess not only the short term, but the mid and long term. If you date your friend's ex, all well and good. But if she's a casual fling to you, you may alienate him before you meet his next ex, who could be a much more substantial relationship. You may also lose his friendship, and that may have benefits of its own.\n\nIt's useful to play games like Risk or Diplomacy for purposes of simulation. Encourage treaties and back room dealing between turns. What you'll find is there are some players who tend to play for their self-interest in all cases. They generally lose first. They have no allies, and so they fall to allied players. Then there are the ones who are loyal no matter what. They tend to win in their hearts, but they lose the game. They're happier, in general than the solo players, but I've rarely seen them win with regularity. Then there are the ones who are loyal and consistent in their contracts, but have contingencies for backstabbing, and grab for the prize when they are assured of reaching it. Those are the players who not only with a single game, they tend to win more often.\n\nSo when you're being opportunistic, keep that in mind.
