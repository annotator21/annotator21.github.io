Let me try to break it down:\n\nIf we are here, with the systems in place as they exist, wanting to keep things as they are now is conservative. As the father modern American conservatism William F. Buckly put it: \"A Conservative is a fellow who is standing athwart history yelling 'Stop!'\"\n\nProgressives are not always right, but they want things to be different from how they are now and different from how they were in the past. Sometimes they are different in a good way sometimes in a bad way. But to be a progressive is to want change, that is all. No assumption of rightness.\n\nFinally a Regressive is someone who, like a progressive, wants change but wants to change back to how things used to be. They don't want to try something new, they want to go back to how things used to be.\n\nSo to but it simplistically, if it is 2014, a Regressive wishes our laws were more like they used to be 20 years ago, a Conservative wants the laws to be just as they are now for the next 20 years, and a Progressive wants things to be different in a way they've never been over the next 20 years. \n\n\"Progressive\" has nothing to do with \"correct\" in this case.

For example: different countries have different tax rates. Does that mean that people evading tax are just as moral as people living in countries with low tax rates? I would say no. By the same token, if one country uses a system of intellectual property, and another has a voucher system, does that make it moral to pirate in the first country?

The only difference is technology, right?\n\n\"The only difference is technology\" is suggesting a very false equivalence.  Let's apply your logic elsewhere:\n\nTwo decades ago, law enforcement used their discretion in surveying potential criminals.  They were bound in who they chose to survey by the sheer time it took them to watch and listen to, so we were fairly comfortable that the police were using reasonable discretion in this grey area around the 4th amendment.  Now, thanks to some advanced content analytics on electronic content, the authorities can scan orders of magnitude more people.  \n\nThe only difference is technology - but the technology and scale/speed it provides it so very fundamentally changes behavior that you cannot compare them logically or morally.\n\n&gt; Sneaking into a movie theatre or concert carries the extra wrongness of trespassing onto someone's property, though. \n\nTrespassing is suggestive of a violation of a person's privacy and security - that's hardly the case in a building that's open to the general public at cost.

Is it wrong to sit on my roof and watch a concert through a telescope? It seems like you would be committed to saying it is wrong, since I'm consuming content I didn't pay for.\n\nThe basis for me stating that piracy is wrong is that it's blatant disregard of the efforts / terms / wishes of the content creator, not simply consuming content without paying.  If someone hosts a concert near you, they do so knowing full well who is capable of looking into the amphitheater... but you and I know full well that you don't really experience the event in an area from outside the venue on public property.\n\n&gt; There's a difference between the claim that \"piracy is immoral\" and \"we should act as though it is or else no one will create content.\" Not only are they different, but the first claim doesn't follow from the second.

The point is suggesting that pirating is OK because a single individuals behavior doesn't change the bottom lines of the system or directly steal from someone is absurd and faulty, because it's important in aggregate.\n\nSure, piracy would - and does - force content creators to re-evaluate their pricing and their services.  Rampant piracy may force content creators to chose alternate methods of monetization, which may increase or decrease the amount of content created (based on how successful &amp; profitable whatever replaces it is).  \n\nBut pointing out that alternate models are theorreticaly possible is a rationalization, but it's not morally sound.

You may think of yourself as a small, inconsequential part of that picture and (in reality) *you are*. A musician or an artist or an actor or a game designer will probably do fine if you take their product without paying: but they won't if *everyone* does the same.

If you want the government to collect taxes and pay musicians, I am confused. \n\nThe reason I brought that up was that sneaking into a museum wouldn't even be a crime if it was open to the public.\n\n&gt;It's interesting that you use capitalism as a defense here, when inherently theft is anti-capitalistic (in a private property society). \n\nNo, theft is part of capitalist society. If your property determines your status, theft makes sense.\n\n&gt;The options are traditionally: pay to have something that costs or don't have it.\n\nTraditionally the only option to acquire data was to acquire physical objects. That implied that the producer of that object lost it, and producing new ones takes time and effort. Now copying media requires no effort or loss on the part of the producer. Why pay for something that costs no effort?\n\n&gt;I just don't understand the mental gymnastics. \n\nThat's because you confused a few things: acquiring an object used to mean that someone else lost it. So you had to pay compensation for their loss. But that also means you had to pay whenever you acquired something. So now you think that you have to pay to get the right to acquire something, but that's wrong: you only need to pay to compensate someone else for their loss. If nobody else loses anything, then there simply is nothing to compensate.\n\n&gt;It involves suggesting: well I wouldn't have had it anyway so they get more word of mouth. As if you do a great service. If the authors choose to let you have it for free to generate word of mouth and kick starter donations -- great! If they don't -- respect their choice, don't just day fuck em. \n\nFirst, is their contradictory private interest to keep their data publicly-available-but-only-in-some-circumstances worth enforcing from a common interest point of view?\n\nSecond, if that media has relevance in society, then I think people have the right to know what's going on.\n\n&gt;It is akin to herd immunity for vaccines. If everyone pays or gets vaccinated, chances are you can skip and get the benefits too. That still means you're a dick living off not only the work of the vaccine creators, but all the others who went through the trouble of getting vaccinated for you.\n\nI disagree with the equivalence. There is not just one piece of music, there are billions. People buy some pieces and copy the rest if their budget is used up.

If your property determines your status, theft makes sense.\n\n&gt;The options are traditionally: pay to have something that costs or don't have it.\n\nTraditionally the only option to acquire data was to acquire physical objects. That implied that the producer of that object lost it, and producing new ones takes time and effort. Now copying media requires no effort or loss on the part of the producer. Why pay for something that costs no effort?\n\n&gt;I just don't understand the mental gymnastics. \n\nThat's because you confused a few things: acquiring an object used to mean that someone else lost it. So you had to pay compensation for their loss. But that also means you had to pay whenever you acquired something. So now you think that you have to pay to get the right to acquire something, but that's wrong: you only need to pay to compensate someone else for their loss. If nobody else loses anything, then there simply is nothing to compensate.\n\n&gt;It involves suggesting: well I wouldn't have had it anyway so they get more word of mouth. As if you do a great service. If the authors choose to let you have it for free to generate word of mouth and kick starter donations -- great! If they don't -- respect their choice, don't just day fuck em. \n\nFirst, is their contradictory private interest to keep their data publicly-available-but-only-in-some-circumstances worth enforcing from a common interest point of view?\n\nSecond, if that media has relevance in society, then I think people have the right to know what's going on.\n\n&gt;It is akin to herd immunity for vaccines. If everyone pays or gets vaccinated, chances are you can skip and get the benefits too. That still means you're a dick living off not only the work of the vaccine creators, but all the others who went through the trouble of getting vaccinated for you.\n\nI disagree with the equivalence.

You're not making any money for yourself by your presence, you're not taking anything from anyone (providing that the concert is GA and you're not sitting in someone else's seat), and you might promote the artist to your friends. \n\nWould you sneak into the concert of a mainstream band? What about an independent artist? What about a museum? Is it okay to sneak into the MOMA or the Louvre? \n\nWhat I'm getting at is: artists need money to continue to do art. You may think of yourself as a small, inconsequential part of that picture and (in reality) *you are*. A musician or an artist or an actor or a game designer will probably do fine if you take their product without paying: but they won't if *everyone* does the same. When you pirate media, what you're saying is: \"I'm going to take this for free, under the assumption that *other people* are going to pay for it\".

But pirating as a matter of principle: I just can't justify. I have pirated lots of things that weren't available in my country, where I was forced to buy them with services I didn't want, or where DRM was dangerous to my system.

No.  Whether a law is enforceable has no bearing on whether the action that violates it is morally wrong.  You know what else we aren't about to stop?  Murdering.  People will keep murdering, even though it's illegal, causing huge costs to police investigation departments.  Should we stop the \"war on murder\"?  No, that's ridiculous.

I'm not sure you quite understand what I'm saying here.\n\n&gt; Can you please answer the question?\n\nAlright, I'll sum up my points.\n\n* Overall, canibilism is somewhat rare in mammals\n\n* Most instances of canibilism among mammals are parents eating their young, usually because of food shortages, since it's detrimental to the animal, as they no longer have an offspring to pass on it's genes.\n\n* Because of this, it's clear that canibilism is biological issue, which is even more relevant than if it were sole an ethical or medical issue. Because it's a biological issue, it points out that canibilism is inherently detrimental to most species, and as such is why most do not practice it.\n\n* There are also the added issues of morality and medicine *on top of* the biological argument.\n\n\nSimply put, it's detrimental for us to eat our young, which is why canibilism is rarely practiced and not looked favourably upon. As for adult canibilism, it's still a biological issue since it's far easier to hunt other animals or grow crops instead of killing each other, since we as a species have developed a highly social society, and as such often depend on cooperation between ourselves. Since we need to cooperate, killing and eating each other is not the most effective way to cooperate."}, {"id": "cmrgren", "body": "\n&gt;Also that other humans are the same species as us, which is actually a very important distinction.\n\nlogically important? I know you feel differently about it but from a purely logical point of view it doesnt matter.\n\n&gt;Because that's literally canabilism? It's one thing to say \"well if you eat cow, you have to be willing to eat cats and dogs\", as that follows logically (although there are actually some decent reasons why it's not the best idea to eat them). But when it comes to a human eating another human, that's a whole different issue, especially since it also tends to require killing another humans to do it. Not to mention that even among mammals the prevalence is somewhat low (and even then, the majority of the cases are if there is insufficient food sources), so it makes sense for humans to be against eating their own kind. \n\nI know you feel differently about eating humans but why is that? Is it just how you feel or do you have a reason?"}, {"id": "cmrk8yl", "body": "&gt;&gt; Also that other humans are the same species as us, which is actually a very important distinction.\n\n&gt; logically important? I know you feel differently about it but from a purely logical point of view it doesn't matter.\n\nLogically yes.  For any species to survive, it must produce enough of eat subsequent generation to keep the species around.  If the species eats itself, then it will not last very long.  Some species can get around it, but they are typically species that are heavily focused into r-selection while humans are heavily focused into K-selection.

I think that moral justification is logically inconsistent so im asking:\n\nGiven the choice of eating either a severely handicapped human and an ape of superior intelligence and thus a higher level of personhood, which is it more ethical to eat? If neither is more or less ethical does that mean eating any animals flesh isnt ethical?\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmsmvbj", "body": "&gt; Im saying that apes are seen as animals and humans as seperate from that group\n\nThat is not true of how I view how humans and other apes stand in comparison to each other.
