Here the actions of both defendants were focused on first isolating, and then intentionally injuring, the victim. From this record there exists no valid line of reasoning that could support a jury's conclusion that defendant possessed the mental culpability required for depraved indifference murder.

Occasionally a cop goes insane and does something like this. The NYPD commissioner seems to be on Garner's side, and many officers have said that what the police officer did was not protocol and was wrong.\n\nBut the police can't know if an officer will do something that goes completely against his training. The truth is the NYPD has been very good in racial issues and keeping crime low. Stop and frisk may seem to be contrary to that, but that was a policy that told the police to go into poor (black) neighborhoods and frisk people. This was not a decision made by the police.\n\nThe problem with the Garner case is the justices system's failure to indite Eric Garner's murderer. Pantaleo murdered Eric Garner. There isn't really any question about this. He did not follow police protocol and attacked a man with his hands in the air and killed him as he begged to breathe.\n\nPantaleo deserves to go to trial, for at least manslaughter if not first degree murder. There is no reasonable doubt or any question of what happened like there was in the Micheal Brown case. With Micheal Brown there was a lack of evidence and conflicting reports, so we can't know and therefore can't prosecute.\n\nBut in the Garner case there was no question. We know what happened.\n\nMy only conclusion from this is that the grand jury had a majority of either incredibly racist people or people who were incredibly loyal to the police for no reason.\n\nI believe that to fix this problem we need to stop using grand juries to decide whether or not to indite. They have proven themselves to be a horrible tool. Instead we should use a panel of judges, or just go to trial immediately when the evidence is this overwhelming. (EDIT: maybe not go to trial immediately. My main call is for a change in the process. I do not necessarily have the change needed.)\n\nThe reason I want my view changed is that I'd like the believe that our system isn't horribly unjust.

A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto.\n\nIn looking at this, the key is whether Pantaleo took an *unjustifiable* risk in the manner in which he detained Garner.  If Pantaleo was lawfully allowed to arrest Garner, it's hard to say that a chokehold is totally unjustifiable.  NYPD policy notwithstanding, an arrest is a situation where violent force to subdue a person is lawfully permitted, and a chokehold for about 20 or 30 seconds is very rarely fatal.\n\nIf Pantaleo had no legal grounds to arrest Garner, then Pantaleo would be guilty of manslaughter, since he would have no justification for any violence against Garner whatsoever.\n\nPantaleo violated department policy and caused a man to die.

There is no reasonable doubt or any question of what happened like there was in the Micheal Brown case.\n\nAs a matter of law, it may have in fact been correct not to indict Pantaleo.  I'm gonna go over the two charges that could be applicable, second degree murder, and second degree manslaughter.\n\nFirst degree murder requires murder plus another felony (e.g. murder while committing robbery), or a couple other circumstances that don't apply.\n\nSo, second degree murder in NY is [defined as follows:](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/THREE/H/125/125.25)\n\n&gt;A person is guilty of murder in the second degree when: 1. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person\n\nDid Pantaleo intend to cause the death of Garner?  If he did not plan and intend to cause death, he is not guilty of murder.  My impression is that he was trying to arrest Garner, not kill him, and did a really bad job of it.\n\nSo next up is manslaughter.  Manslaughter in the second degree in NY is [defined as follows:](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/THREE/H/125/125.15)\n\n&gt;A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: 1. He recklessly causes the death of another person\n\nSince recklessness is the key to this, we also need to see [the definition of recklessness:](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/ONE/B/15/15.05)\n\n&gt;A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto.\n\nIn looking at this, the key is whether Pantaleo took an *unjustifiable* risk in the manner in which he detained Garner.  If Pantaleo was lawfully allowed to arrest Garner, it's hard to say that a chokehold is totally unjustifiable.  NYPD policy notwithstanding, an arrest is a situation where violent force to subdue a person is lawfully permitted, and a chokehold for about 20 or 30 seconds is very rarely fatal.\n\nIf Pantaleo had no legal grounds to arrest Garner, then Pantaleo would be guilty of manslaughter, since he would have no justification for any violence against Garner whatsoever.\n\nPantaleo violated department policy and caused a man to die.  He should be fired and never allowed to be a police officer in any jurisdiction again.

Again, this is why the NYC police prohibit the practice, because it is *known* to be dangerous. \n\n&gt;While Garner was very vulnerable due to his size and health conditions, I would say the risk of death from a 19 second choke hold is not very high for most people.\n\nIf his conditions were a contributing factor that is an important consideration, but if that is one of the issues, then that is another reason this should have gone to trial because that is the sort of thing where a bunch of expert witnesses subject to cross examination should be brought in so that a finder of fact could weigh all the factors to come to a particular conclusion on that point. \n\n&gt;My original response to OP was in reply to the statement that there was no reasonable doubt as to guilt.

But I don't blame the NYPD for it. Occasionally a cop goes insane and does something like this. The NYPD commissioner seems to be on Garner's side, and many officers have said that what the police officer did was not protocol and was wrong.\n\nBut the police can't know if an officer will do something that goes completely against his training. The truth is the NYPD has been very good in racial issues and keeping crime low. Stop and frisk may seem to be contrary to that, but that was a policy that told the police to go into poor (black) neighborhoods and frisk people. This was not a decision made by the police.\n\nThe problem with the Garner case is the justices system's failure to indite Eric Garner's murderer. Pantaleo murdered Eric Garner. There isn't really any question about this. He did not follow police protocol and attacked a man with his hands in the air and killed him as he begged to breathe.\n\nPantaleo deserves to go to trial, for at least manslaughter if not first degree murder. There is no reasonable doubt or any question of what happened like there was in the Micheal Brown case. With Micheal Brown there was a lack of evidence and conflicting reports, so we can't know and therefore can't prosecute.\n\nBut in the Garner case there was no question. We know what happened.\n\nMy only conclusion from this is that the grand jury had a majority of either incredibly racist people or people who were incredibly loyal to the police for no reason.\n\nI believe that to fix this problem we need to stop using grand juries to decide whether or not to indite. They have proven themselves to be a horrible tool. Instead we should use a panel of judges, or just go to trial immediately when the evidence is this overwhelming. (EDIT: maybe not go to trial immediately. My main call is for a change in the process. I do not necessarily have the change needed.)\n\nThe reason I want my view changed is that I'd like the believe that our system isn't horribly unjust.

If applied properly, it's a submission hold that only cuts off blood to the brain, as you've described. However, the officer does not appear to apply it properly, and it appears instead that his forearm puts a lot of pressure on the guy's windpipe. \n\nSo, on the one hand, it certainly looks like a chokehold.

Instead we should use a panel of judges, or just go to trial immediately when the evidence is this overwhelming. \n\nEven without grand juries, prosecutors still have discretion. They are regularly called upon by police and detectives investigating a case to determine whether they have a winner or not. Sometimes everyone working the case knows that John Smith murdered his wife, but the prosecutor may not believe that they have enough evidence to *secure* a conviction. Rather than risk losing after jeopardy has been attached, they would rather wait for a case to be as ironclad as possible. If we remove prosecutorial discretion we risk forcing prosecutors to work unwinnable cases, which would waste money and leave the general public in equal danger.\n\nThe specific problem that needs to be addressed is not the grand jury process or prosecutorial discretion--it's the incestuous relationship between prosecutors and police and the general public trust of law enforcement officers that reduces the chance of criminal proceedings in cases where authority has been misused. We already have a [special prosecutor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_prosecutor) system, where special prosecutors from outside the government can be assigned to cases where a public official is investigated for wrongdoing. I think it only makes sense for law enforcement officers accused of wrongdoing to have their cases handled by people who do not regularly work with the department in question. In such cases, a special prosecutor might be more motivated to sway a grand jury than a prosecutor who has an interest in maintaining a collegial relationship with the police department.\n\nAnother aspect in such cases is how the law actually *treats* law enforcement officers. For example, Missouri has a law that allows police officers to use deadly force on fleeing felons provided that the officer reasonably believes that the person in question may do harm to others. Even if Wilson's prosecutor truly believed that Wilson was in the wrong when he shot Brown, how is a prosecutor to reconcile bringing charges when such a law is on the books? All Wilson had to say (and he did say it, in his testimony) is that he feared for the lives of civilians and other police officers if Brown was allowed to escape.  The Supreme Court didn't exactly strike down fleeing felon laws--it just ruled that deadly force should be avoided if possible, but that the use of deadly force is not inherently unconstitutional. In Washington there is a law on the books that the prosecutor must [prove malicious intent](http://www.policemisconduct.net/the-problem-with-prosecuting-police-in-washington-state/) when charging an LEO with some form of homicide for exercising deadly force while on duty. With laws like these on the books that are designed to maximize police discretion, it's difficult even for prosecutors acting in good faith to execute their duty to the public.\n\nAnd even when prosecutors *do* charge police officers with crimes, the conviction rate is about half the rate of civilians and they serve much less time than civilians do. So, even when given a fair trial, juries are still inclined to believe that police officers should be given more leeway/leniency when misusing their authority. This is even true of cases where there is video evidence of misconduct. (Which is why the call for cameras is essentially useless. We've all seen videos here on reddit of police using improper force, and yet the comments are full of \"it was clearly an accident\" or \"dude was fat and deserved to die\" or \"police officers make 26 bucks an hour, give the man a break.\" Sure, there are also outraged comments--but some of the \"clearly an accident\" types are sure to be on any given jury.\n\nIMHO, the public perception problem is the toughest nut to crack. You don't want to send a message to the public that LEOs should be distrusted, and you certainly don't want to deny LEOs the right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Constitution. It's also very difficult to overcome the fact that most LEOs using excessive force are doing so against people who are likely to be criminals. People in general have less empathy for people who violate the laws of our society. Moving to an entirely internal system, like the military has, comes with its own set of problems.\n\n&gt;The reason I want my view changed is that I'd like the believe that our system isn't horribly unjust.\n\nThe system is unjust, and nothing I've said can change that view. I just wanted to point out that grand juries aren't the problem--it is difficult to convict law enforcement officers for actions performed while on duty, period. (Corruption or off-duty shenanigans seem to be an easier pill for juries to swallow.) Changing the grand jury system is unlikely to result in a better conviction rate for LEOs charged with crimes committed during the performance of their duties. It's a systemic problem of the law and public perception that would exist regardless of the use of the grand jury. Note that prosecutors can file charges regardless of what a grand jury says, and have done so, sometimes decades after the original proceeding."}, {"id": "2o9h6l", "body": "What happened to Eric Garner was a horrible tragedy.

I've kept track of over 180 moods as a hobby of mine for over 3 years, and to be frank if everyone else did what I have done, they would know these \"experiences\" they have are but a drop in the bucket of what the brain can make us feel and endure. I basically equate religious belief to that of acting, but obvious to far a greater extreme. I myself am not an actor, however by taking advantage of irrational belief, I'm able to do a number of things, such as temporarily bound any of my negative attributes with those of other people, or elevate my mood using the raw essence of belief.

You have a moral opposition to violence right now, but no visceral reaction against it.  This means that you are much more likely to resort to violence if it looks feasible, even if right now you can't imagine doing it.  \n\nYour desensitization means that any pacifism on your part is more intellectual than anything else; due to your moral code you believe violence is wrong.  That is correct and good, but consciously held beliefs can change more easily than instinctive reactions.\n\nIf one day, a really convincing preacher comes by and persuades you that by randomly shooting people you will go to heaven, your desensitization to violence means that there is no reason why you wouldn't do it, while if you were instinctively repelled by violence you might still be unable to carry through."}]}
