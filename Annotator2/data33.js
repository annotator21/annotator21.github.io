He had gotten flirty and physical with a woman at a bar in our hometown. The two of them kissed and made out a bit, and she gave him his number. They went out last night, and he called me afterwards to tell me that she was transgender. She disclosed this after she had given him head at her apartment.\n\nMy brother is very upset and beside himself. While I am an LGBT ally and a very sex positive person, my little brother is much more neutral on these issues, leaning more towards conservative ideals. He feels like he's been \"lied\" to and \"violated\", and I think he's right. \n\nMy argument is based on the assumption that a significant percentage of the population wouldn't otherwise have sex with a transgender person if that information were to be disclosed. Therefore, it is not moral for a transgender person to put someone at risk for taking actions they would otherwise regret. A transgender person is responsible for consent during sex that is fully informed. \n\nThere exists a very real, and I'd argue dominating, belief amongst the populace that having sex with a transgender man or woman isn't the same as having sex with a \"born\" man or woman. While the truth of this is matter is up for debate, \"truth\" in this situation is irrelevant. What is relevant is that a great deal (probably majority) of straight men and women wouldn't feel comfortable having sex with a transgender individual. This isn't necessarily \"fair\" or \"right\", but a fact that anyone, *especially* a transgender person who has been made to face those sorts of prejudices. \n\nTo not disclose this information is dishonest and wrong. By not disclosing this information, a transgender person is knowingly having sex with an individual who probably wouldn't be comfortable with it otherwise. While the cases are certainly not identical, this is akin to keeping sexual diseases a secret. Let's say I have herpes. I need to assume that a sizable, if not the majority, of people I want to sleep with would refuse to do so if I disclose this information. While some people might say, \"Herpes isn't a big deal, and if you don't have an outbreak my chances of getting it are low. Let's have sex.\" But to assume that is not moral, and failing to disclose this information takes a way fully informed consent. \n\n**EDITED: She gave my brother head, sorry to make that unclear.**"}, {"id": "cmpjnp5", "body": "I would agree that someone should tell either before there are strong feelings, or before having sex, but It seems like your brother was told very early on.\n\nWhen do you think they should tell someone?

The 'ick' factor is when straight people freak out over the idea that someone outside their target gender could be attracted to them. They do believe that same-sex attraction is a perversion because of the way it makes them *feel*.

I think this is largely lizard brain stuff, really reactive responses from the most primitive parts of our brains - and that it takes our higher cognition (and appropriate shaping thereof) to guide those primitive responses into acceptable behaviours (which is no different to any other time it happens. Your brain attempts to interpret emotions and physical sensations in the body in cognitive terms, and mistakes are common. Anyone that's ever had a panic attack understands that - you aren't going to die, but you *feel* like you're going to die, so your brain *acts* like you're going to die).\n\nAll of that is why it's so hard to fight discrimination.

I think this is largely lizard brain stuff, really reactive responses from the most primitive parts of our brains - and that it takes our higher cognition (and appropriate shaping thereof) to guide those primitive responses into acceptable behaviours (which is no different to any other time it happens. Your brain attempts to interpret emotions and physical sensations in the body in cognitive terms, and mistakes are common. Anyone that's ever had a panic attack understands that - you aren't going to die, but you *feel* like you're going to die, so your brain *acts* like you're going to die).\n\nAll of that is why it's so hard to fight discrimination. Discrimination is based on *feelings*, so getting people to change their behaviour (and ultimately their feelings because of that) is really a challenge. You have to convince them that their interpretation of their bad feelings is incorrect and unwarranted. You cannot change people's feelings directly, only indirectly."}, {"id": "cmr46u1", "body": "You're just looking at our modern culture here in America, though.

It's been a learning experience but he understands that my reproductive organs are just one part of me. \n\nThis attitude of transgender people are obligated to tell partners their past reproductive organs comes from the basis that trans women are just men in disguise. Every time I've seen this argument come up online or among friends, they just don't have a clue how important it is for transwomen to leave their past behind. \n\nAs for myself upon transitioning i saw my mental capacity go up tremendously. The mental anguish and drain that gender dysphoria can cause someone can be crippling. 41% of transgender people attempt suicide. I too tried to bail out of this mortal coil, but I am glad I did not. \n\nAll this to say, it's far more important for transwomen to leave their past in the dust than it is for you to be informed. If you can't handle a dick (personally I am a fan and so are a lot of straight men) pack your shit up and go home. \n\nHope that helps"}, {"id": "cmprwrv", "body": "&gt;This attitude of transgender people are obligated to tell partners their past reproductive organs comes from the basis that trans women are just men in disguise.

If the transwoman is post-op, then we're done here, because at that point, yeah, she's a woman as far as anyone should be concerned.  My comments ONLY apply to a pre-op transwoman (a surprise penis).\n\n2. Please don't confuse my POV here with hating on or discriminating against trans people in any way.  I support LGBT rights, I know trans people, and I think society should absolutely accept trans people for who they are and shouldn't allow discrimination against them in any way.  That being said, I think once a pre-op transwoman starts into sexual relations with a straight guy without disclosing her penis, that moves from societal acceptance into personal preference, and a transwoman has NO RIGHT to lead a guy on and then feign offense when the man is surprised/disgusted.  You can support trans rights and at the same time not want a surprise penis.\n\n&gt;I mean, I definitely don't think that's a good idea.\n\nGood, because it isn't.\n\n&gt;I think it's ridiculous to feel emotionally traumatized by it.\n\nWay to invalidate someone's feelings.  This is a very self-centered way to be.  If a person has a certain expectation from a sexual act and the act was misrepresented to them and ends up in a way that they never would have wanted to participate in, you think that it's ridiculous that they're emotionally affected by this?  Sexuality and emotion are intimately connected, are they not?\n\nWould a man hook up with you if he knew you had a penis?  If you can't confidently answer this question yes, YOU SHOULDN'T HOOK UP WITH HIM.  End of story.  It's not your business to push someone else to accept something they may not be comfortable with.  I don't see how you can push this responsibility onto the other party.  YOU, as the trans person, are responsible for your own actions.  \n\n&gt;but I get the shock and repulsion that he'd feel at that moment. \n\nYou say this, but then you think he should just be smooth and say no thank you.  You don't seem like you really understand.\n\n&gt;I don't understand why it would invalidate a sex act that he had already enjoyed with the trans person while fully clothed.\n\nBecause from a straight man's point of view, he's been deceived for sexual purposes, and this is wrong.  He never would have wanted to hook up with a woman with a penis.  If you'd have asked him at the beginning of the encounter he'd have said no.  A guy isn't looking at a woman and thinking she could potentially have a penis.  Trans people are an extreme minority.  He's looking at a woman and thinking he's going to get pussy.  It is extremely self-centered of a trans woman to just plow through the act thinking a straight guy would be okay with it.  To then turn around and get defensive about how he might react to it is very disingenuous.\n\n&gt;at which point he could have said \"uh, okay, I'm sorry but I'm super not into that and I don't think we can continue. Uh, I'll be putting my pants on now, see ya.\"\n\nSure.  Or you could NOT HAVE PUT HIM IN THIS SITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.  Sometimes people don't react \"properly\" when surprised.  You can't really blame a guy for being traumatized if he's being sincere.  Someone with sincerely held conservative beliefs may be \"wrong\" about trans people, but that doesn't give a trans person the right to force the issue and then claim the guy's in the wrong for freaking out.  \n\n&gt;his brother WAS attracted to this woman, and enjoyed their sexual encounter.\n\nBECAUSE HE THOUGHT SHE HAD A VAGINA.  HE HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT SHE DIDN'T.  If he'd have known, he probably would have passed on the encounter.  He wasn't given the information until after sex acts had occurred.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN RATIONALIZE THIS.\n\n&gt;&gt;as long as you're willing to accept the fact that most guys won't be into it and you're setting yourself up for rejection at the very least, and possibly even assault or battery.\n\n&gt;I agree with that entirely, but are you saying that's okay?\n\nAbsolutely not.  It is not okay, and that crime is 100% on the criminal.  \n\nBut that doesn't mean a transwoman shouldn't expect it to happen because she didn't properly disclose her surprise penis.  Because it could, and she should be aware that that sort of thing could happen.  SHE can avoid the situation by acting in a certain manner.\n\nJust like someone walking alone down a dark alley shouldn't be mugged, but perhaps they also should be walking on the street where there are lights or walking with friends.\n\nJust like someone who leaves their house unlocked shouldn't have been robbed, but they could have locked their doors.\n\nJust like a woman who is blackout drunk shouldn't be raped, but could also have taken steps to protect herself by not getting so drunk around people she didn't trust.\n\n&gt;Why? Why is it her obligation to warn you if she has a body part you might not be attracted to, whether it's a penis or pubic hair or a giant weird birthmark?\n\nAre you serious?  You're putting weird pubes into the same category as having a dick?\n\nIt's her obligation because she ISN'T BIOLOGICALLY FEMALE.  The man most likely wants someone who is biologically female.  From a straight man's perspective, he's being FOOLED.  A transwoman who doesn't disclose it before the act takes place is a man in a woman costume to him as far as sexual desire goes.  You have a very good disguise on, but at the end of the day, you have a dick, and he's being LIED to.  You think this is okay?  \n\nSexuality and gender are intimately related.  Transpeople should understand this BETTER than anyone else.  I can guarantee you that a guy probably doesn't get emotionally traumatized if a woman has pubes or a birthmark.  Should she have a penis, he's probably going to be very put off.\n\n&gt;My issue is with people BEING attracted to trans people (with their clothes on), enjoying sex with trans people, and then being disgusted with themselves and feeling violated when they find out that the sex act they enjoyed that didn't involve the other person's genitals in any way was actually with someone who had genitals that they aren't attracted to.\n\nThen perhaps this hypothetical trans person shouldn't have created the issue in the first place, because it's entirely her doing.  It could have been entirely avoided if she had disclosed once things started moving toward sexual activity.  It's not fair to put the burden of understanding onto the other party if they're not ready for it.  Being \"right\" (i.e., being a trans person that deserves acceptance) doesn't give you the right to violate the rights and beliefs of someone who is \"wrong\" (i.e., someone who may be at any other point on their journey towards accepting trans people).\n\nYou go on to conflate having a surprise penis to having an injury or a oddly shaped vagina again.  They are not the same thing.  I just don't understand how you can be so oblivious on this.\n\nTL;DR: Society has a responsibility to accept and respect trans people on the whole, but any individual cis straight man is under no obligation to find a trans woman attractive, and no trans woman should get too far into sexual activity with a cis straight man before disclosing her surprise penis.  To willfully fail to disclose is deceit for the purposes of sexual activity, which is very wrong, and could be very offensive to the other party."}, {"id": "cmpxdrv", "body": "&gt; but I imagine it could wreck me emotionally.\n\nWhy?  \n\nIf you're attracted to a person, why would finding out their label make you suddenly not attracted to them to the point of being emotionally distraught?

I have never had a friendship or really even met a transexual/transgendered person before.

Being suddenly exposed to it like OP's brother would be a lot to handle. I'd like to think I'd accept it, but there's no way I can know. In relation to homosexuality, the issues the trans community faces is fairly new.

I have tried to change my mind, even if it was just for the simplicity of not having to worry about it, but I still feel like I'm lying to myself. Humans are often extremely stubborn and the \"deal with it\" approach isn't the best way to change minds, in regards to this topic at least.

No. Maybe it's something you mention to a current more serious SO, but not to a hookup. \n\nYou're using the transphobia of the general public to justify your argument, but I don't think that's right.

They'd probably care quite a bit and possibly be upset, but I don't *know* that they will. If they are racist, then it is *their* responsibility to ask if I am fully white before hooking up with me, because one of their standards is \"only have sex with a white person.\" If they don't bother trying to find out, then that's their problem, and if they find out later and regret having sex with me, then that's not my fault. I should not cater to bigoted people. \n\nTo today: a trans woman does not need tell her hookup that she is post-op trans.

I feel like not only do I not belong in my own body, but I don't belong in this world (something that's reinforced by most rhetoric in today's sexual society), and that's a feeling I've taken to some dark places. Unlike you, I don't have any hope of changing. So don't assume. \n\nAnd yet, no matter how difficult it is for me to face the fact that I will likely be alone, physically and emotionally, for the rest of my life, I always broach the subject with anyone who might be interested in me early. My anguish is something that I'm equipped to handle, and it runs deep into my soul. But I'm not going to be the cause of anyone else's pain. I'm not going to let anyone get hopeful just so they can be crushed. \n\nYou can change your sex if you know you're born into the wrong body. But you'll *always* be a transsexual. Just like I can fuck as many people as I see, and say all the words, \"I love you,\" but I'll *always* be asexual. Running from it never made me feel better. Getting angry when people didn't understand or care didn't make me feel better either. \n\nI get the danger part of telling people, and I agree that transsexuals need to put their safety first. I guess everyone copes in their own ways, but \"leaving the past in the dust\" just isn't a long term solution in my opinion. It's just avoidance, and it caters to the type of society where being transsexual is something to be \"left in the dust.\" There's nothing socially or culturally wrong with being a transsexual. There's nothing to be embarrassed about, and if the situation isn't dangerous, it's a part of your identity that *matters* because it is who you are and always will be.  \n\nThere are a lot of great arguments in this thread re: timing, and I agree that a post-op transsexual doesn't have to tell a one-night stand anything. But there's a point in intimate relationships where that information needs to be shared, for purposes of trust. The trans individual doesn't even need to bring up *their* transsexuality, they can ask what their partner thinks of transsexuals to at least *have that conversation.* \n\nI get that many trans people put on a tough face and a tough attitude because that's the only way to hold up against the internal turmoil they suffer. But I'm seeing it all over this thread, even in your phrase \"If you can't handle a dick, pack your shit up and go home\": they expect understanding from cisgender folks, but don't offer understanding back. That aggressive attitude, that \"I don't have to take the first step\" attitude will only alienate and divide people's perception of transsexuals.

The more the same study is repeated with the same results, the better-supported the theories based on the results are.  To my knowledge, the studies that support the transgender-intersex theory are few, limited, and small in sample sizes.\n\nRegardless, I think that body characteristics are what come to people's minds when they want to avoid having sex with transgender people.  What I don't think these people understand is that sex is harder to define than it looks on the surface.  We usually think of sex coming as a package deal, but sometimes, the parts come mixed up.  Even with two non-intersex people of the same sex, one might be more male or female than the other.  For example, Mary might have more testosterone than Sue.  Despite being \"completely\" female, Mary might have a flat or nearly flat chest.  Arnold, despite being \"completely\" male, might have what we'd call moobs.  Two cisgender, non-intersex men might have either different levels of exposure to testosterone or different levels of response to it.  One might be noticeably more feminine-looking, while the other is noticeably more masculine-looking.  \n\nWe tend to think of sex as strictly binary, despite the fact that we all start out as undifferentiated, female-ish embryos.  These embryos can develop in any number of ways, and they do appear to be very sensitive to sex hormones.  What we think of as men and women are really the same basic type of organisms that became differentiated over time, at their own unique levels and in their own unique ways.  \n\nWhen you look at an average cisgender woman and an average cisgender man, the stark physical differences that you see are caused by hormonal differences.  It's not magic; it's biology.  The hormones themselves, without the help of anything sacred or supernatural, are powerful enough to make two similar-looking people grow up into very different-looking people.  Transgender people just do the whole puberty thing twice, with the second time being artificially induced.  But is that really so different from giving hormone therapy to a cisgender person or an intersex person who wants to fit in as the gender they identify as?  Look up Andy Milonakis on Google images.

As though it is that person's \"fault\" that they had to change their body. \n\nIn reality, the decision to do so is *so* heavy, *so* stressful, and the process is so lengthy, that the impetus to go through with it must be highly, highly convincing.\n\nI might also just pop in and say that not all trans people want to be out.

He had gotten flirty and physical with a woman at a bar in our hometown. The two of them kissed and made out a bit, and she gave him his number. They went out last night, and he called me afterwards to tell me that she was transgender. She disclosed this after she had given him head at her apartment.\n\nMy brother is very upset and beside himself. While I am an LGBT ally and a very sex positive person, my little brother is much more neutral on these issues, leaning more towards conservative ideals. He feels like he's been \"lied\" to and \"violated\", and I think he's right. \n\nMy argument is based on the assumption that a significant percentage of the population wouldn't otherwise have sex with a transgender person if that information were to be disclosed. Therefore, it is not moral for a transgender person to put someone at risk for taking actions they would otherwise regret. A transgender person is responsible for consent during sex that is fully informed. \n\nThere exists a very real, and I'd argue dominating, belief amongst the populace that having sex with a transgender man or woman isn't the same as having sex with a \"born\" man or woman. While the truth of this is matter is up for debate, \"truth\" in this situation is irrelevant. What is relevant is that a great deal (probably majority) of straight men and women wouldn't feel comfortable having sex with a transgender individual. This isn't necessarily \"fair\" or \"right\", but a fact that anyone, *especially* a transgender person who has been made to face those sorts of prejudices. \n\nTo not disclose this information is dishonest and wrong. By not disclosing this information, a transgender person is knowingly having sex with an individual who probably wouldn't be comfortable with it otherwise. While the cases are certainly not identical, this is akin to keeping sexual diseases a secret. Let's say I have herpes. I need to assume that a sizable, if not the majority, of people I want to sleep with would refuse to do so if I disclose this information. While some people might say, \"Herpes isn't a big deal, and if you don't have an outbreak my chances of getting it are low. Let's have sex.\" But to assume that is not moral, and failing to disclose this information takes a way fully informed consent. \n\n**EDITED: She gave my brother head, sorry to make that unclear.**"}, {"id": "cmpxaj0", "body": "I feel that asking this is too much for transgender people.
