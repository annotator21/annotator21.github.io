How will it benefit society?\n\nTruthfully, welfare and food stamps doesn't pay a whole lot out to people.  It would be near impossible to have an addiction paid for by these programs.  So it is unlikely that much of these benefits are going to a drug dealer, sure in some cases, but not a whole lot.\n\nWelfare really gives the bare minimum to survive.  The biggest benefactors of these programs are children.  Cutting off parents for positive drug tests would do major harm to the children.\n\nIf people were being cut off because of drugs, they very likely would turn to crime just for survival.\n\nDrug testing often has false positives. This can cause undue hardship to innocent people.  Since these people are destitute, any type of appeal process would need to be taxpayer funded.\n\nBy virtue of how drug testing works, they are unfair towards choices of drug use.  Cocaine, meth, and heroine can be untraceable after a weeks use, while marijuana can stay in the system for months.  Also, simply being around marijuana use, without actually partaking, can result in a positive result.\n\nAnd my final point, is that testing is really kicking people while they are down.  Some people on these programs are there because life took a bad turn that wasn't really their fault.  It could be because of illness or death in the family, company went under, legal issues, or a whole host of other problems.  These people probably already feel bad about themselves, many tried to stay off the dole for as long as possible.  Asking for a drug test is questioning, to some, their moral fiber.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the only real purpose of drug testing, is to please the people that don't really want welfare benefits to exist in the first place."}, {"id": "2ondkw", "body": "Recently there has been talk, in my state at least, of drug testing welfare and food stamp recipients.

According to the data given by /u/the-incredible-ape, it appears that between 5 and 10% of typical welfare recipients use drugs (which is in close range to general population, which is 9.2% as of 2012 according to [the National Institute on Drug Abuse](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends)). If that is accurate, then in order to see savings in the program, you would have to have welfare recipients test for benefits with a cost of no more than 5-10% of the benefits planned to be distributed. The most recent stat on how much a drug test costs came from an ACLU article in 2008 which estimates the average screening costs $42. Assuming that is correct, you would want to only test each month to break even if average benefits are at least $420/month (that is accepting the high end of estimated drug use, i.e. 10%). Testing less often means that you allow larger periods of time where drug use does not affect benefits, and would therefore be less desirable in terms of curbing use among recipients. This is ridiculous, though, as data from several states shows lower rates of positive testing, like Florida's 2.6% positive rate, which would imply a need to test once for every $1600 of benefits to see a break even on testing. So the question there becomes, \"How important is it that the government is sure that people who receive help also do not use drugs?\" Further, there are frequent calls for end of social assistance programs like unemployment benefits and food stamp programs, so regardless if testing were implemented and effective, it wouldn't take long for even more calls to come forth, insisting that the drug testing portion of these programs is too expensive and the programs should be ended because of the waste.\n\nFurther, you have to consider how this affects the recipients who don't use drugs. If roughly 1 of 40 use drugs, per Florida's example, is it worth it to spend those recipients' time on drug tests when they could be seeking work, tending to children, gathering skills through workforce development programs or other education, or doing absolutely anything else? The fact is that there are some marketable cases of abuse of these systems, but in reality very few who participate in welfare are problem cases. After stirring up outrage over those few cases, it is easy to forget that there are other people involved who desperately need assistance to make it each month and at best programs which give disincentive to drug use just adds burden honest users and at worst discourages participation from the people who need these programs the most. \n\nEmployees: State governments have two basic sets of employees in my mind, those that are hired and those that are elected. The hired folks typically have supervisors and bosses who evaluate performance and can be fired if necessary. If drug abuse is present, it will either negatively impact performance and they will be fired, or it wont and they will stay on. That seems appropriate to me. For elected officials, however, you see a different dynamic, as they tend to have only elections to judge if they have a job or not. At this level, officials typically have salaries which can justify use of drug testing, so that part isn't so important. What you should ask yourself is what detriment does drug use among leaders and officials cause? I imagine that it would be similar to hired employees, but it would become a ballot issue and in some cases a legislative issue, as was the case with Rob Ford. In either case, there seem to be available mechanisms in place which allows the government or its people to identify and correct drug use problems in this arena. \n\nAnyone taking my tax dollars: Welfare and employment are not the only uses of taxes. Taxes go to infrastructure, defense, research and development, community resources, and so much more. Surely, taking it to this extreme is taking your original position and stretching it, but slippery slopes all start somewhere, right? It may seem fine to ensure that current recipients of welfare and wages from the state should be drug free, but as is the case with many control policies, an inch can turn into a mile really quick. Permitting governments to institutionalize the monitoring of populations for illegal activity with prejudice instead of giving the same agencies the tools to reasonably and quickly react to fall out from those activities, in my opinion, is misguided.\n\nThe only way I can see to defend testing is if it can be done in a cost efficient manner to limit an endemic problem. The data available to us suggests that the cost of testing is too high to be supported by potential savings and the problem of abuse is not big enough to offset the harms to others who rely on the system."}, {"id": "2ondkw", "body": "Recently there has been talk, in my state at least, of drug testing welfare and food stamp recipients.

Its not because Registering is \"hard\" its because the politics stinks.\n\nThis simply isn't true. Or rather: It may be true for some, but not for others.\n\nA lot of data has been collected on the effects of lowering voting costs, and the results are pretty much unanimous: lowering voting costs increases turnout, holding all else equal. A simple example that illustrates this point is to compare US states with same-day registration to states without same-day registration. Same-day states score [more than 10 percentage points higher](http://www.demos.org/blog/new-report-higher-voter-turnout-linked-sdr) than states without same-day registration.\n\nSomething you may not be aware of since you're British but that I think is relevant to this topic: in the US, there is an enormous debate between Democrats and Republicans regarding voter registration laws and the ease of voting. Democrats want to make voting easier because groups that are less likely to vote when costs are high (e.g. the poor, Hispanic immigrants, etc.) are more likely to vote Democrat. Naturally, Republicans tend to oppose making voting easier for this same reason.\n\nNeither party would devote so much energy to this issue if it wasn't the case that both of them know that ease of voting has a significant effect not just on voter turnout, but on the *relative proportion* of different groups that vote."}, {"id": "2om8ww", "body": "So the UK has for some reason decided to have mandatory voter registration apparently to encourage more people to vote (despite registrations plummeting after they changed the system) . \n\nI never understood the logic of this, what if you really don't want a part in the electoral system and don't want to be bothered by the mailshots, canvassers, details being sold to some company etc. that all happens around election time and simply want to get on without paying attention to elections etc. then surely you should have the right to be \"forgotten\" from the election roll?

I don't think there should be a direct penalty for each person who refuses to vote I think that all functions of the state, other than a token station keeping effort to enable late votes to be cast to restart the system, should simply be shut down if an insufficient number of voters turn up to vote during the mandated voting periods.\n\nImagine if only 30% of a country's eligible citizens turn out to vote.  I would argue that any government formed with only 30% participation, regardless of the break down in votes among that 30% has no real right to govern the entire population.  Even if the other 70% of people could have voted if they'd wanted to the choice to not participate in the system should be counted as a vote against having a any system in the first place, not as a vote to support whatever the majority of the people who did vote wanted to do.  \n\nThe implicit vote against having a system at all should count just as much as a vote to have the system work a certain way (i.e. a vote for a particular candidate) and no political system should exist if less than at least 50% (perhaps more) of its participants continually and affirmatively assent to its very existence, to say nothing of it's actual behaviors.\n\nThere are many downsides to such a system, for example no one in their right mind would extend credit to a state which could be reasonably on the brink of dissolution every 2,4,6 years without a very high interest rate.  However, such a system would make civic responsibility an essential part maintaining a stable and predictable life.  Knowing that not participating could lead to the complete removal of all State services rather than 'the system continuing on in one of two directions you don't like but can at least predict' might inspire more people to participate, if only indicate they would prefer something to to nothing.  Casting A blank ballot should count as a vote for maintaining the system and as implicitly supporting whoever or whatever the majority of people who actually have a preference select.\n\nMany would argue that the result of such a political system could and probably would quickly be chaos, I would argue that the alternative to having any political system at all is always chaos, but that a system that is designed to reduce the threat of chaos even at the cost of infringing on the basic rights of people to actively and meaningfully determine what they do or don't want to agree to is just kicking the can of chaotic revolution down the road rather than actually accepting the reality that the natural state of humanity is low grade chaos and that isn't necessarily the worst thing in the world any more than it's the best."}, {"id": "2om8ww", "body": "So the UK has for some reason decided to have mandatory voter registration apparently to encourage more people to vote (despite registrations plummeting after they changed the system) . \n\nI never understood the logic of this, what if you really don't want a part in the electoral system and don't want to be bothered by the mailshots, canvassers, details being sold to some company etc. that all happens around election time and simply want to get on without paying attention to elections etc. then surely you should have the right to be \"forgotten\" from the election roll?

It doesn't take much to realize that, as stated in your post.  \n  \nAliens however, can absolutely be justified to exist. Anatomically modern humans evolved on earth approximately 200k years ago. Why 200k years ago instead of 2 million years ago? That's just how it happened. Whatever lead to the evolution of the homosapien just simply took that long to happen. However, assuming extra terrestrials exist in the same dimension and therefore experience time in a forward-progressing way, we can ask:  \n  \n1. If humans had evolved 2 million years earlier, that would mean modern day society would be 2 million years ahead of current technology.  \n  \n2. In 2 million years I have a feeling that space travel will have been conquered through technological advances.  \n  \n3. We can therefore ask; what if *other* sentient beings started their evolution 2 million years before us; simply because their planet sustained life earlier than ours did... We can assume, if the conditions were right, they could be immensely more intelligent than us.  \n  \nThere are many theories that suggest the reason we have no experienced intelligent contact yet is because we are NOT an intelligent race. I don't mean wars and killing, I just simply mean that to them it would be like stopping on the sidewalk to have a conversation with an ant. To them, our vocal chords are so primitive that it would be impossible for them to stoop to our level. This truly saddens me because I have such a hunger for knowledge of the universe.....

Replications are often wasted effort. If you want to get two other groups to replicate a result then you probably double the total amount of time and money spent on the research (as an estimate I'm saying it takes 1/2 as much time and money to replicate a result as to produce it). Science is limited by money. That's just something that we need to live with. This means that research now progresses at *half* the rate it did before. And what do we get? A whole ton of studies saying \"yes, we could replicate this\" and some studies saying \"we couldn't replicate this result\". Is that really worth the cost?

By contrast, in India, people often live with their parents even after getting married. I think it's similar in other Asian cultures but I can only really speak for India. A better way to summarize it is that the American \"nuclear family in the house\" model is inferior to the Indian \"extended family in the house\" model.  \n\nOne reason is the convenience factor. If you work in the same general area as where your parents live (i.e. in the Bay Area or in LA), it just makes sense for you to live with them. You can save money on rent/mortgage and utilities. You can share rides. You can live in a place that you're already intimately familiar with.  \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Who knows you better and loves you more than your parents? No one, that's who. Sure, friends and lovers are good for fun and pleasure, but when it comes to people who genuinely love you and care for you, no one can beat your parents (or, for that matter, extended family like grandparents and relatives). Your parents also need you to take care of them when they're older, and that's just not possible if you live somewhere else. In the American/western system, aging parents are often thrown into a retirement/nursing home and abandoned there. In the Indian system, they're cared for and loved and cherished in their old age.  \n\nOf course, as I said, none of this is true if you work in a completely different part of the country (i.e. if your parents live in California and your job is in New York). But if possible, it's better to live with your parents and it's also a sign that you love them more.  \n\nI guess the reason I'm posting this is that I currently live with my parents and I'm looking to move out of my parents' house and into an apartment. Admittedly, I'm quite sick of living here and I don't get along much with my parents anymore (I'm a 27-year-old Indian guy) and I have been looking for apartments, but I can't help but feel like moving out would be \"wrong\" or \"non-Indian\".\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Is there **value** to be had in paying your own rent/mortgage to get your own place?\n\nI would argue that the value of money is often entirely subjective.  You may find it a fantastic use of money to eat at a restaurant for $50, then pay another $20 to go see a movie... someone else may consider that an awful idea, feeling smug when they eat a $2 pack of minute rice and watch Netflix.\n\nThe point I'm making is that, if spending $70 on a night out is *worth it to you,* then no one can tell you that you're spending that money **wrong.**  There is no \"wrong\" way to spend money.

I admire Indians for how well they take care of their parents and how loving their families can be.\n\nMy wife and I had our first child about six months after moving across the country. As soon as my mother found out that we were having her first grandchild she put in notice for her job and started arranging to move from Chennai back to the US, completely abandoning the plans she had made for the next two years. \n\nI'm not sure what would have happened in the first year of my son's life if we hadn't had my parents nearby. For various reasons it was a very difficult period for us, and my parents were essential to us in making it through. I could never repay them.\n\nWe've now been living in the same city as my parents for about a year and a half, seeing them every other day at times. My parents are actually helping us afford an apartment closer to where they live. And yet we don't live in the same house as them. In fact, *we consciously made the decision to not live with my parents and my parents agreed.*\n\nWhy? I'll focus on two reasons, which may just be aspects of the same reason. I hope it will help you see some of what can be gained.\n\n**Personal development**\n\nLet me put it this way: I had no idea how wise my parents were until I left home for university. I was a pretty obedient and well-behaved kid and teenager, but obedience to rules is not the same as internalizing the reason for the rules. In my experience, the freedom to make mistakes and see consequences was what fully converted me to all the good things my parents had tried to teach me. I remember that all the time in my early adulthood that I would have some great life insight only to think \"Oh, so that's what my dad was trying to explain when I was 16!\" It's hard to not have someone to lean on when making tough choices, but that's where real life satisfaction comes from.\n\nSo why wait until your father passes and leaves you in charge of the family to start this kind of personal growth?\n\nAnd it goes beyond early adulthood. As much as I love having grandparent babysitters, and as much as they love their grandchild, we all recognize that I need to have primary responsibility for my son. My wife and I need to be the ones making baby's rules, and even scolding grandma and grandpa when they're broken (smartphone time is over, grandpa!). I'm sure it's possible to be an in-charge parent while living with grandparents, but it's just that much harder, and my parents agree.\n\nEven worse, I revert a little when I go home. All the personal flaws that I discovered and fixed away from home come creeping back when I spend too long at my parents' house. Relationships are like deep ruts that we roll into, and when I put myself into my old home context, I roll back into my old home relationship.\n\nNow I don't want to make any assumptions about how mature or immature you are. I don't know you and that's not my intention. I also don't mean to imply that I've got life figured out -- I'm  still pretty immature in a lot of ways and I'm still learning a lot from my parents. But what I do suggest is that having parents to lean on can actually kind of skew the way the world looks, and that it's harder to see the skew when you live at home. I think it's beneficial for everyone to see how things look when they're on their own, no matter how old.\n\n**The mother-in-law issue**\n\nI know you're single, but marriage relationships are deeply mixed in with this question. Indian tradition has couples move in with the man's parents. That's not easy for a wife. It means she's always competing for her husband's affection. (Maybe not in an ideal world, but we don't live an ideal world!) She also can't ever fully run her own household or fully parent her own children, free from the way her mother-in-law wants to do things. And all because of a woman she didn't choose to be related to! That's why my mother does not want to live in the same house as us -- she doesn't want to risk doing that to my wife.\n\nI'm not sure how you feel about arranged marriage, but good luck finding a woman to love and who will love you completely when you also have to convince her to love your parents.\n\n----\n/u/JamesDK mentioned that the Bible instructs newlyweds to leave their parents and to cleave to their spouses. The Bible also commands everyone to honor their father and mother. These are not mutually exclusive! You will honor your parents best by demonstrating that you are a responsible, good person who has internalized all of their best teachings. You cannot fully demonstrate that if you are always under their watchful care.\n\nIf you worry about feeling \"non-Indian,\" here's a thought. I know \"Indian-ness\" and Hinduism are pretty well conflated. Hinduism is interesting because it is not a religion of orthodoxy (strict sayings or beliefs) but of orthopraxy (strict practice). So there is nothing to \"Indian-ness\" but what Indians do! Traditions are valuable, but sometimes they need to change. If you can convince yourself that moving out is better for everyone, then you can make that your tradition and change what \"Indian-ness\" is. I have many friends who have had to make similar decisions to alter traditions, and doing it thoughtfully and with good intent can make a world of difference."}, {"id": "2ol8oi", "body": "In the US (and I'm guessing other western countries), people traditionally leave their parents' homes and get a place of their own at some point relatively early in their adult lives - perhaps after high school, perhaps after college, or perhaps once they get a job. By contrast, in India, people often live with their parents even after getting married. I think it's similar in other Asian cultures but I can only really speak for India. A better way to summarize it is that the American \"nuclear family in the house\" model is inferior to the Indian \"extended family in the house\" model.  \n\nOne reason is the convenience factor. If you work in the same general area as where your parents live (i.e. in the Bay Area or in LA), it just makes sense for you to live with them. You can save money on rent/mortgage and utilities. You can share rides. You can live in a place that you're already intimately familiar with.  \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Who knows you better and loves you more than your parents? No one, that's who. Sure, friends and lovers are good for fun and pleasure, but when it comes to people who genuinely love you and care for you, no one can beat your parents (or, for that matter, extended family like grandparents and relatives). Your parents also need you to take care of them when they're older, and that's just not possible if you live somewhere else. In the American/western system, aging parents are often thrown into a retirement/nursing home and abandoned there. In the Indian system, they're cared for and loved and cherished in their old age.  \n\nOf course, as I said, none of this is true if you work in a completely different part of the country (i.e. if your parents live in California and your job is in New York). But if possible, it's better to live with your parents and it's also a sign that you love them more.  \n\nI guess the reason I'm posting this is that I currently live with my parents and I'm looking to move out of my parents' house and into an apartment. Admittedly, I'm quite sick of living here and I don't get along much with my parents anymore (I'm a 27-year-old Indian guy) and I have been looking for apartments, but I can't help but feel like moving out would be \"wrong\" or \"non-Indian\".\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I believe that we humans aren't more evolved than any other animal, we just evolved differently but together with other animals. I also believe that we are all part of the same biological tree and that suffering for the sake of pleasure, ideologies, etc. is wrong. Anyways, I eat meat, any kind of it; pork, chicken, fish, you name it and I very much enjoy it. But I know that we're killing and exploiting animals just for our pleasure, and I also believe that one person can make a difference so if I stop eating meat, it's a step in the right direction. I can't, however, I love meat and this generates a huge cognitive dissonance in my mind and I just want to be consistent with my thoughts and my actions so either convince me that eating meat is alright considering my world views or the contrary if necessary. I just want some peace of mind. Thanks.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

But you mention the cognitive dissonance of loving meat and yet believing this act is morally unacceptable. This is where perhaps I can offer some guidance.\n\nI love meat too. I love food, and there are plenty of delicious dishes that are made with meat. (Though there are plenty that aren't, as well!) But ultimately, as you mentioned, ignoring your moral views to indulge your pleasures is wrong.\n\nBut think about it this way: You are not the sole person responsible for making this world a better place. Collective problems require collective solutions, so it is the combined efforts of many that will help to reduce pain and suffering, reduce environmental damage, etc. So engaging in self-flagellation for your sins is not a productive way to deal with the situation, and ends up making the situation worse (it can lead to the mindset of \"well I've already screwed up, so what's the difference?\").\n\nWhat you need to remind yourself is that there is always room for improvement. Moral issues that require lifestyle change like this are always a gradual process. If you can't find the resolve to give up meat entirely, just try to reduce your meat consumption. That effort in and of itself will help, and it avoids the guilt complex that can arise from an all-or-nothing approach. Doing it gradually can also help you learn to cook new types of meals that don't involve meat, as well as discover your new identity of being vegetarian. As you get more comfortable with the process, you may find that the love of meat is joined by or replaced by a love for other types of food, the rich variety of foods that humans can enjoy as a result of our unique evolutionary history. And if you feel the urge to enjoy some meat once in a while, try to make ethical choices in that too: find free-range options, reduce red meat consumption, and so on. But as you go, you can set goals for yourself, gradually reducing your consumption to as low as you find morally acceptable. If that means no meat at all, that's great! If it means eating it once a week, or once a month, that's great too! There is still room for you in the veg*n community, and we welcome those who make the effort to change.\n\nThe point of all this is to say that you don't need to beat yourself up about your ethical failures. That actually ends up making the situation *worse*, because you're more likely to just give up in the end. But if you come at it with moral resolve, some goals to improve, and some self-compassion as well, you're much more likely to succeed, and it won't seem like such a moral burden.

Abrahamic faiths essentially say that we, as God's children, are governed by his law and the world around us is tailored for us. This is why it doesn't make much sense to apply morality to the actions of other animals.\n\nBut in rejecting the view that we occupy a privileged spot in the universe, which you do, I don't see a case for applying objective morality to humans.

What I do think, however, is that people in favor more gun control spend far more effort on it than they should, if saving lives, reducing injuries, or reducing societal costs are the goal. \n\nTobacco and alcohol should be far more hated than guns are. Let me explain:\n\n&gt; Yet every year tobacco kills more Americans than did World War II \u2014 more than AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide and suicide combined.\n\n[Source.](http://www.lung.org/associations/states/colorado/tobacco/) That's a total of 443,000 people. 88,000 of those deaths are from secondhand smoke, which is very disgusting to me because many of those victims had no ability to prevent being near it.\n\nGuns account for 32,000 deaths per year -of which 11,000 are homicides- and 71,000 injuries [source.](http://www.bradycampaign.org/sites/default/files/GunDeathandInjuryStatSheet3YearAverageFINAL.pdf) \n\nAlcohol causes [88,000 deaths per year]( http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm), of which over [10,300](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html) were killed from DUI's. Of those,  [1,168 were children.](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html)\n\nOn top of this, while seems to me that neither alcohol nor tobacco has any significant benefits, at least guns can be used for defense, and when guns are used properly they are safe; but it is literally impossible to smoke or drink without doing damage to the body.\n\nI know guns cause needless deaths and injuries, but smoking isn't pursued politically like guns are. Not only that, but grabbing a smoke isn't reacted to as negatively as having a gun is in society, even though second hand smoke alone is more likely to kill you. Nobody gets scared at the cigarettes or beers sold at gas stations, yet most are uncomfortable at the presence of a gun.  \n\nThe point isn't that we shouldn't do reasonable gun control measures or that gun violence isn't a problem, but that the energy and drive put into banning assault weapons after Sandy Hook was more effort than has recently been put into banning tobacco. \n\nOutside of guns being intrinsically scary, why is it relatively targeted so much both politically and in society? I know my post makes it sound like I'm just plugging my own opinion, but I'm genuinely asking to see what I'm missing.\n\nEdit: I have seen a few people say that more gun control is the next thing on society's menu, but that doesn't make mathematically sense if saving lives is the point. Some have implied that the deaths of smokers and drinkers isn't what's important, but rather the deaths of those who never chose to do the dangerous things. But, because of how many people die from secondhand smoke relative to guns that point also doesn't make sense. Some say that tobacco is already regulated so society is moving on to guns, but guns are even more regulated (backgound checks, and to carry in public a safety course is required. No such course that explains the dangers is required to buy cigarettes). It seems to be that the *kind* of death is what matters, where a bullet is more sudden and dramatic than cancer.

Even with accidental deaths, guns are so much more immediate.  If someone smokes a cigarette, they aren't going to fall over and die.  Shoot even with alcohol it takes some effort to die from it.

We have successfully legislated against tobacco and alcohol, have spot checks for DUIs, reduced the public's exposure to second hand smoke, and have many many public awareness campaigns. I almost never see items like this against gun control. \n\nIt may seem like people are putting more effort into the gun control just because it *isn't getting anywhere* with any of the effort that they have put forth previously. "}, {"id": "cmormzq", "body": "&gt; I almost never see items like this against gun control.\nIt may seem like people are putting more effort into the gun control just because it isn't getting anywhere with any of the effort that they have put forth previously.\n\nWe already have FAR more gun restrictions than alcohol or tobacco ones. While there are minimum ages for all 3, and there are smoke free zones, there are also gun free zones, background checks, restrictions on what kind of gun can be owned, what kind of accessories can be owned (like silencers), import bans, in the 90's there was an assault weapons ban, and to carry one in public you have to pass a concealed carry course. The main restriction over the last 20 years on smoking is the creation of smoke free zones and higher taxes, which doesn't seem like as much.\n\nI can see why the strong *pro gun* movement could cause the anti gun movement to get more passionate (it becomes a fight instead of just a piece of legislation), but there has certainly been a lot done to restrict guns. I still don't get (outside of them being scary) why guns should be stopped instead of the more deadly tobacco."}, {"id": "2ol1jg", "body": "First, let me say that I understand those who have been affected by gun violence will be passionate about the topic, and I don't mean to demean the loss guns cause or say they are a non issue. What I do think, however, is that people in favor more gun control spend far more effort on it than they should, if saving lives, reducing injuries, or reducing societal costs are the goal. \n\nTobacco and alcohol should be far more hated than guns are. Let me explain:\n\n&gt; Yet every year tobacco kills more Americans than did World War II \u2014 more than AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide and suicide combined.\n\n[Source.](http://www.lung.org/associations/states/colorado/tobacco/) That's a total of 443,000 people. 88,000 of those deaths are from secondhand smoke, which is very disgusting to me because many of those victims had no ability to prevent being near it.\n\nGuns account for 32,000 deaths per year -of which 11,000 are homicides- and 71,000 injuries [source.](http://www.bradycampaign.org/sites/default/files/GunDeathandInjuryStatSheet3YearAverageFINAL.pdf) \n\nAlcohol causes [88,000 deaths per year]( http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm), of which over [10,300](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html) were killed from DUI's. Of those,  [1,168 were children.](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html)\n\nOn top of this, while seems to me that neither alcohol nor tobacco has any significant benefits, at least guns can be used for defense, and when guns are used properly they are safe; but it is literally impossible to smoke or drink without doing damage to the body.\n\nI know guns cause needless deaths and injuries, but smoking isn't pursued politically like guns are. Not only that, but grabbing a smoke isn't reacted to as negatively as having a gun is in society, even though second hand smoke alone is more likely to kill you. Nobody gets scared at the cigarettes or beers sold at gas stations, yet most are uncomfortable at the presence of a gun.  \n\nThe point isn't that we shouldn't do reasonable gun control measures or that gun violence isn't a problem, but that the energy and drive put into banning assault weapons after Sandy Hook was more effort than has recently been put into banning tobacco. \n\nOutside of guns being intrinsically scary, why is it relatively targeted so much both politically and in society? I know my post makes it sound like I'm just plugging my own opinion, but I'm genuinely asking to see what I'm missing.\n\nEdit: I have seen a few people say that more gun control is the next thing on society's menu, but that doesn't make mathematically sense if saving lives is the point. Some have implied that the deaths of smokers and drinkers isn't what's important, but rather the deaths of those who never chose to do the dangerous things. But, because of how many people die from secondhand smoke relative to guns that point also doesn't make sense. Some say that tobacco is already regulated so society is moving on to guns, but guns are even more regulated (backgound checks, and to carry in public a safety course is required. No such course that explains the dangers is required to buy cigarettes). It seems to be that the *kind* of death is what matters, where a bullet is more sudden and dramatic than cancer. Is there any other reason to prefer more restrictions on guns as opposed to more restriction on tobacco if not alcohol?"}]}
