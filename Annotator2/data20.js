It feels like wholesale traffic theft just to get free advertising revenue. Like, seriously... you can pull up an article and [it's got the entire webpage of another news site like Reuters embedded inside itself](http://news.yahoo.com/thousands-protesters-expected-washington-nyc-over-police-killings-110531287.html), without any button (as far as I can tell) to just link back to the original source. \n\nEven most news sites that will all jump on the same story will usually have their journalists write their own summation articles and just link to their sources in the text, which feels somewhat like plagiarism but I understand that news aggregates through being told and retold, and as long as the article is written originally that seems fine. This, however, just feels like stealing seeing as the websites for these articles are literally just wrapped inside of Yahoo's.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I also believe they should not change from person to person.\n\nFor example;\n\nI believe that for the purpose of self defense out in public, persons should be limited to weaponry that is small and not automatic. Pistols would be a good example. I think that anyone should be allowed to carry such a weapon concealed or in view for the purpose of self defense when in public.\n\n* I also feel that this would make a clear distinction between those who have guns to do harm to innocents and those who have them to protect. If you saw an automatic weapon or a rifle for example, you would know that person has it illegally and is intending to harm people with it.\n\nHowever, I think we should have a completely distinct law for arms that are intended for the defense of a person's home or property:\n\n* I believe that firearms for the protection of a person's home or property should have **absolutely zero limits.** \n\nI believe you should be able to use lethal or non lethal force however you see fit to defend your own property. I believe that if you decide that two Tec-9's is what you need to fire on an intruder that you should have every right to do so and no Government should be allowed to take that right from you. (That's not to say I would advocate for doing that.) I believe that the person who is confronted with the situation is the best person to decide what is apropriate for the situation (in respect to defending their home) **Not a cop, jury, government or anyone else.**\n\nLastly, **I think this should apply to all people.** I believe a police officer should not have the right to carry an automatic weapon in public when a citizen cannot. If a cop comes into a \"cop vs citizen\" situation, **they already have superior numbers, training, situational awareness and strategy. They do not need superior firepower**\n\nI know many people do not agree so let's see it.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Their \"normalized\" figure is the one that I'm taking issue with, precisely because it *doesn't* accurately track the percentage of civilians who own firearms.\n\n&gt;Would it necessarily be so different though? How many of those killings were made concurrently with a single weapon, such as a firearms massacre? \n\nExtremely few.  In the U.S., mass killings make up less than 1% of firearm homicides, and substantially less than 1% of overall homicides.  As I mentioned previously, they're statistically irrelevant.\n\n&gt;Even still, looking at it from the perspective that Americans would just generally be more violence prone, that's even less reason to trust them with something like a gun.\n\nYour reasoning here really doesn't make sense.  The entire point here is that even though Americans have very high rates of violence *and* very high rates of firearms ownership, the guns are not causing the violence and removing them will not stop it.\n\n&gt;This is fairly true, as being more violent tends to make you more prone to use any available weapon, but that's just all the more reason to make sure that these violence prone individuals are kept as far away from massacre facilitating tools as possible.\n\n\"...massacre facilitating tools...\"  Enough with the appeals to emotion and loaded language.  This is CMV, you can do better than that.\n\nWhat the chart shows is that overall rates of firearms ownership do not correlate with homicide rates.  In other words, ease of access to firearms (or \"massacre facilitating tools\") *does not make a difference* in the number of people killed, so making them harder to access *would not result in a reduction* in the number of people killed.  The *only* exception to this might be mass shootings, except, as established earlier, they're statistically irrelevant in terms of overall homicides.

I believe that if the people don't have weapons the police should not either.\n\nAlright, cool. We're working towards a similar mindset here. I'm going to go ahead and link to a [controversial comment I made before about gun control on another CMV](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2ntrrq/cmv_gun_control_in_the_usa_is_waste_of_time/cmgthad) as there are some points there which I feel may help sway your view. \n\nThe big point I think there was that when Australia banned guns, they became massively expensive on the black market. Banning them for all public carry, there's no mistakes about the size of the gun, about open carry, or about whether or not that \"rifle\" is actually technically a \"pistol\" with an arm brace stock on it... the gun is illegal in it's own right. And because the same rifle that most people could pick up in a Walmart now for $1000 would be $34k, if you've got that kind of money you really don't need to be turning to crime anyhow, you're doing well enough for yourself. So that means the criminals won't really have guns either. No need for civilians, nor cops. It would be a slow process of course, trying to slowly filter the weapons out of service, but there would probably be concessions and technicalities. Most people really enjoy their guns for the thrill of firing them, and I understand that. Firing a gun, that kick of the shell going off and hitting you in the chest, reaching out and hitting a target so far off... if they were limited to being on firing ranges, you could still own your guns and fire them without them being a public danger. \n\nPersonally, I think the first thing to target would be ammunition. Remove the metal ammo from the market, leave less-than-lethal rounds like bean bags and perhaps simunition.  This would make ammo massively expensive for the criminals too, so you'd get them, and you wouldn't have to deal with the strains of American gun culture and trying to collect all those firearms. You'd essentially starve the weapons of their lethality. \n_____\nEdit:\n&gt; I would make 30 round magazines illegal (for use in public)\n\n*Sorry, just wanted to come back and clarify as I did before... but reloads are so quick that even smaller mags aren't always the definitive solution. How hard is it to reload a pistol or an AR15, or almost any gun? Pull the mag from the mag well, drop the empty mag, grab a new one, slide it it, rack the slide/bolt. With guns like AK's you have to rock the mag, and pistols and AR15's it's a little fiddly sometimes to aim the mag into the hole... but it's really not that hard. A good quick reload can be done in under 10 seconds, under 5 if you've got any practice... reducing the mag size adds brief pauses, but probably not enough to make a big difference in a massacre situation.*"}, {"id": "2p61s8", "body": "Allow me to explain.\n\nI think that gun laws should not be blanket laws (or laws based on the weaponry itself) but should instead be based on the place and situation.

During this moment, i could not help but thinking that the pledge, and patriotism in general, meets the criteria for idolatry. Afterall, you are pledging your allegiance to a peice of fabric and the fact that you add your gods name in it as if he has some sort of stake in your geographic location seems quite vain and insulting.  Those who have read the bible know how severe idolotry is. It is perhaps the greatest insult to your god if you are a follower of an abrahamic religion. After the pledge, the pastor told all veterans to go first to get their food. Again, it struck me as odd, because by joining the military you are accepting that you may have to kill another person who believes in the same God as you for unjust reasons and for your country (which is just a bunch or arbitrary lines in the sand). By joining the military you are putting country first. You are putting it before your god and before his other children who he tells you to love.

What I mean is that I know the subject from a variety of perspectives from a wide variety of time periods and places, I hunt source material rigorously, from an academic perspective. I also chose an existential approach. I practiced various forms of Christianity and Judaism so I might understand it. I do understand them.\n\nFormally, if you were talking to ancient Yahwists or Moses, you'd be absolutely right. Not because of the idolatry prohibition, which just prohibited worshiping anything you made as beyond its maker (which would include men and literature, but good luck convincing the Christians and Jews that considering books and people perfect is idolatry) but the commandment before it: \"You shall have no other gods before me.\" That's your supporting verse and I'll tell you why.\n\nGods for folks in the ancient world were different than gods for us, and due to the wording in Hebrew (which is controversial to say because it was written first in Paleo-Hebrew and are oldest formal source is Greek, and even then these are just reports of what the stones said. Nevertheless let's just agree that the prohibition was preserved right) you'd be right. First, gods.\n\nA god in the ancient Levant was any power. Kings, weather, a government, the sun, anything that had power because the word for \"gods\" was like our word \"powers\". The idea of deities came from ascribing anthropomorphic properties to these forces, and then trying to appeal to them through prayer, worship, and so on. The logic is obvious: Things more powerful than us are probably wiser than us, too.\n\nMoses was a god in that sense, hence Exodus 7:1 - \"See, I have made you a god [strong power] to Pharaoh, and Aaron your prophet.\" Prophet meaning messenger.\n\nThe commandment translated more directly reads: \"You shall have no other gods before my face.\" You can read before as \"on my face\". You get the idea.\n\nSo you shall have no other powers on God's face. They read and spoke literally, by the way.\n\nAscribing the interests of the United States Federation to God is literally putting the USA powers, a god, in front of the Creator's face, another god. The Creator is reported to have claimed ownership of his creation and said to put no lower power on his face, so if you believe the ancient testimonies, it'd be a mistake to associate the Creator with the United States.\n\nActually, the method of his revelation according to Moses and the prophets was social: His revelation was not a special quark or rip in timespace, or a picture of himself, it was to create one nation under the Creator to bless the world. Nations in the ancient Levant had gods as mascots and that's why there's no cult of Chemosh or Molek anymore, because Yahweh defeated them in battle; like giant Pokemon. The losers would usually willingly convert because they wanted to follow the stronger and truer god. In effect, Yahweh is a national god, which is why his revelation was so strong: The Israelites claimed that he not only was their regional god, but the literal creator of their nation, the establisher of all their feast days, laws, tribal boundaries, everything. That nation was Israel, which is said to be actively disciplined, retaliated against, and protected by the Creator to the end of bringing peace to mankind through their example of following of the ten commandments and becoming utopia (the Jews say to follow the Torah and Talmud, the Karaites say the Torah only, the Christians say Jesus, but the only thing written in stone at Sinai were the ten commandments; and we don't have 'em. Moreover, ancient contracts were in stones. You got a stone, I got a stone. If you \"lost\" yours, I could present mine and prove you a liar. When the contract was fulfilled, if it wasn't permanent contract, we'd shatter the stones together. This is why Moses threw the stones when he saw Israel sinning with the golden calf. I digress.

I had never taken a class above the 200 level before, nor did any of my previous peers take any either. There was no soft introduction. I was shot in the head with hard work from the get-go.\n\nUnlike the rest of my peers at university who could take 1-3 general education classes each semester throughout undergrad, I did not have that option. Each semester I took was significantly harder than almost anyone else in my major. There were no \"easy\" or \"slack off\" classes available to me. All my classes had major projects and significant course loads due every single week.\n\nSometimes I am so overwhelmed with work by week four of fifteen that I cry in the middle of doing homework. My 18 credits are not the same 18 credits everyone else has (really they take 12 or 15). Some weeks I'm easily pulling in 60 hours a week - and I'm an *English* major.\n\n**Administration has no idea what to do with you:** The truth is most community colleges are focused on technical careers and the transfer students are just a small part of it. Those who graduate are even a smaller part of it. So when I transferred the administration dropped the ball on evaluating my credits and I had to work really hard to get them to accept classes I already took.\n\nAdvising is also a nightmare. I wasn't even given an adviser for my first year, something I did not even realize I was missing until the end of my second semester. Annual evaluations were all I had at first, and they were shit. My advisers were terrified every single time I came in. Even though I am slated to graduate in Spring I think they messed up somewhere and I won't figure it out until I get a graduation evaluation done.\n\n**You are not on all the mailing lists:** E-mail is annoying but I only get one or two e-mails a day compared to the fifteen or twenty my classmates get, possibly because I was not a freshman on campus. For whatever reason I'm not on half the mailing lists I *should* be. This means a lot of resources my classmates get I have *no idea exist* until I hear someone talking about it.\n\n**You Have Less Time to Make Connections:** Good for money, bad for networking. While my classmates get to start taking courses with professors in my major as Freshman, I didn't get that opportunity until I was a junior. And the courses I do take are condensed in a shorter time-frame, so the long-lasting relationships my classmates have with teachers just can't happen with me.\n\nI also have a more difficult time making friends since most students knew each other as freshman. The harder course load also makes it more difficult to do outside activities or even have friendships. I just don't have the time. I'm either doing work or recovering from doing work.\n\n**You Have the Taint:** Everyone I meet thinks I'm retarded. By going to community college people automatically assume I'm below 80 IQ points. It's really not that hard to get into college anymore, and people who go to community college are \"really dumb.\"\n\nThis also complicates admission into grad school on two accounts. One, you went to community college, so you are going to need a stellar GPA, and considering your other issues that's going to be hard. Two, you arrive at university as a *junior*. Think about all the other problems I discussed, and you realize that school comes cheaper at a cost. An opportunity cost.\n\n**My Final Verdict:** I went to a great community college. I saved a lot of money. I would not do it again. I have suffered considerably due to my experience. I have had less opportunities and more stress in my everyday life."}, {"id": "2p5ffl", "body": "I am addressing people who intend to go to college for a bachelor's.

House of Commons members are elected by the public, and the leader of the party with most amount of seats (don't have to be majority) is selected as Prime Minister by Governor General (Queen's Representative in Canada).  \n\nSenate members, on the other hand, is chosen by Governor General by the advice of ruling Prime Minister. This procedure cause the chosen members tend to be leaning to (if not member of) the ruling party of the day. Once a senate member is chosen, they will hold their seat until age of 75 (unless resign or removed), when they're forced to retire. The appointment of senators take into account proportionality of provinces and territories. Senate can block the passing of a bill, though it's rarely used; so House of Commons have much of de facto power in the parliament.  \n\nIn recent years, there have been movement to reform, if not abolish, the Senate. Some parties push to have Senate members to be elected, some push to limit their term to 7 years, and one party push to abolish them altogether. The Liberal Party (who historically is Canada's \"natural governing party\" though they lost a lot of seat in last election and currently third largest party in parliament) recently removed all their senators from the party, making them technically independent so that they get to decide their own stance and doesn't have to follow Liberal Party's stance.  \n\nI believe that Senate should not be abolished and should not be elected, though other kind of reforms are fine. I believe the fact that senators are unelected give them the power to speak their conscience and to discuss the bill with debate that is based on facts and researches. Because they don't have to worry about re-election, they can decide on \"the right thing to do\" and not only \"the thing that win votes\" or \"the thing that win sponsor money\" (oh ya, i forgot to mention that personal and corporate contribution to parties are capped and each party is given campaign money from taxpayers' money proportional to amount of votes they got). They are often called as \"sober second thought\" because they are not easily swayed by vote winning or partisan motivated actions.\n\nIdeally, chosen Senate members are experts in some fields (military, law, journalist, etc).

Most people who get labelled \"SJW's\" are feminists. The celebrity nude leak was very much a feminist issue--a bunch of nude pictures of female celebrities were being distributed online against the wishes of those celebrities. A lot of people who, all things considered, were probably otherwise decent and respectful individuals weren't even thinking twice about downloading and masturbating to these photos. The whole event was a testament to how casually many people were willing to violate the rights of and sexually objectify these women against their will. So, in summary, it was an event that was obviously relevant to the feminist agenda.\n\nThe Sony link isn't relevant at all to the feminist agenda. Corporate documents were leaked. It was an invasion of privacy, but not one that had anything to do with women's issues. \n\nA feminist might think it's a bad thing that these documents were illegally leaked to the internet. I'm sure lots of people who identify as feminists agree that the person who leaked these documents did something wrong, and should be punished if s/he is caught. But you wouldn't expect a feminist organization to officially respond, or for someone to reference their identification as a feminist when protesting this. In the celebrity leak, it was common to hear statements like \"as a feminist, I think this is wrong because...\" This would be a silly thing to say in the Sony example, because the crime has nothing to do with feminism.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that it's kind of silly to expect a bunch of specifically *feminist* critiques of the Sony leak, because it has nothing to do with women's rights or women's issues. That doesn't mean that there aren't people who happen to be feminists who think the Sony leak was a bad thing. **And it's not any more hypocritical for a feminist to fail to comment on the Sony leak, than it would be for a cancer fundraiser to fail to mention multiple sclerosis.** The people in charge of the cancer fundraiser probably think that multiple sclerosis is also a bad thing, but the point of the fundraiser to focus on cancer specifically. \n\nAs for your argument as a whole--I do think that the any invasion of privacy should be taken seriously, and that the individuals who leaked this documents did something wrong. However, the cases are very different, and it's unfair to simply write them both off as \"invasions of privacy\" and then wonder why people respond to them differently. If I stole a friend's phone and posted to facebook a text they had sent complaining about a coworker, I would be doing something wrong, and s/he would have good reason to be upset with me. However, I don't think it's hypocritical to say that it would be a worse thing to do if I stole that friend's phone and posted his/her nude selfies onto facebook and \"revenge porn\" websites. This isn't a perfect analogy, but I think it captures the basic idea pretty well."}, {"id": "cmt71xn", "body": "You are right, decent human beings condemned it, I think I was trying to illustrate that those two groups of people (SJW's and Media Outlets) aren't crying foul in this scenario.\n\nYou bring up an interesting distinction about company vs personal though.

I doubt anyone arguing in favor of these \"enhanced\" tactics in the name of \"national security\" would advocate raping women for information.  \n\nEDIT: I didn't think I'd have to put this here, but apparently it needs to be noted: I'm a woman, a feminist, and a rape survivor. I'm getting some aggressive PMs accusing me of being a trolling woman-bashing MRA guy who thinks men are always the victim of women. \n\nI don't know how to change the details of this CMV to more clearly illustrate my point that, in American society, male victims of sexual assault receive less sympathy than women, at least partially because men are expected to be strong, dominant protectors, not victims. That's NOT to say that women receive \"too much sympathy\", only that everyone deserves a support system and justice, and men are less likely to receive it in this instance for various cultural reasons. As a result, I think the fact that the United States government used rape as a war tactic is less shocking to the public because the victims were men, and not women. \n_____\n\n\"Prisoners were subjected to 'rectal feeding' without medical necessity. Rectal exams were conducted with 'excessive force'. The report highlights one prisoner later diagnosed with anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids and 'symptomatic rectal prolapse'.\"\n\nSource: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal\n\nOk. If it was reported that a female detainee was sodomized with medical devices so frequently and so forcefully that she suffered a torn anus and her intestines were spilling out of her ass, I doubt Dick Cheney would proudly promise \"And I'd do it again!\" when asked about authorizing these tactics.\n\nDetainees were often kept naked, were beaten, waterboarded, chained and forced to stand in stress positions for up to a week at a time. And there are probably many more horrors that we will never know about. An interrogator and torturer at Abu Ghraib said of the Senate report's details, \"I\u2019m not surprised. I assure you there is more; much remains redacted.\"\n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/opinion/the-torture-report-reminds-us-of-what-america-was.html?_r=1&amp;referrer=\n\nAs heinous as all this is, there are some: the folks at Fox News (and at least some of their viewers), former VP Cheney, and some members of Congress, who are comfortable with this level of torture because they insist these tactics were necessary and effective in keeping us \"safe\" (which has also been disputed by the report). \n\nAt the same time, I remember when Bush and Cheney were trying to drum up support for the Iraq War, they cited \"rape rooms\", torture, and other abuses of Iraqis as an emotional appeal to the American public. The image of a woman being subjected to sexual violence by government officials was convincing enough that many parroted these details as a reason why we need to \"liberate\" Iraq. The general consensus was that this sort of treatment is inhumane and would fall under the realm of \"crimes against humanity\".\n\nNow, there aren't many high profile women working within terrorist groups, though they do exist. Would the same people who are comfortable with the treatment of male detainees be comfortable subjecting Samantha Lewthwaite, AKA the \"white widow\", to the same conditions to source information from her?\n\nWhat about other extremist groups? White supremacists/neo nazis, militant environmental groups, Chechen rebels, etc, etc. \n\nOf course, I'm completely opposed to any form of torture. Once it's sanctioned for one purpose to save lives, why not another?  But even if it's kept within the limited realm of the CIA, it seems this behavior is acceptable to commit against men, but would be labelled as a war crime if this was done to women.\n\nPerhaps it is because men are more commonly associated with terrorism. Perhaps it is because we view sexual violence against women to be somehow \"worse\" than it is for men. Regardless of the reasoning, the fact that sexual violence is an acceptable interrogation tool against men, but not for women, is incredibly sexist and wrong. \n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmtd9py", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cmtd9py", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cmtfqvg", "body": "This doesn't challenge OP's view.

I doubt anyone arguing in favor of these \"enhanced\" tactics in the name of \"national security\" would advocate raping women for information.  \n\nEDIT: I didn't think I'd have to put this here, but apparently it needs to be noted: I'm a woman, a feminist, and a rape survivor. I'm getting some aggressive PMs accusing me of being a trolling woman-bashing MRA guy who thinks men are always the victim of women. \n\nI don't know how to change the details of this CMV to more clearly illustrate my point that, in American society, male victims of sexual assault receive less sympathy than women, at least partially because men are expected to be strong, dominant protectors, not victims. That's NOT to say that women receive \"too much sympathy\", only that everyone deserves a support system and justice, and men are less likely to receive it in this instance for various cultural reasons. As a result, I think the fact that the United States government used rape as a war tactic is less shocking to the public because the victims were men, and not women. \n_____\n\n\"Prisoners were subjected to 'rectal feeding' without medical necessity. Rectal exams were conducted with 'excessive force'. The report highlights one prisoner later diagnosed with anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids and 'symptomatic rectal prolapse'.\"\n\nSource: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal\n\nOk. If it was reported that a female detainee was sodomized with medical devices so frequently and so forcefully that she suffered a torn anus and her intestines were spilling out of her ass, I doubt Dick Cheney would proudly promise \"And I'd do it again!\" when asked about authorizing these tactics.\n\nDetainees were often kept naked, were beaten, waterboarded, chained and forced to stand in stress positions for up to a week at a time. And there are probably many more horrors that we will never know about. An interrogator and torturer at Abu Ghraib said of the Senate report's details, \"I\u2019m not surprised. I assure you there is more; much remains redacted.\"\n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/opinion/the-torture-report-reminds-us-of-what-america-was.html?_r=1&amp;referrer=\n\nAs heinous as all this is, there are some: the folks at Fox News (and at least some of their viewers), former VP Cheney, and some members of Congress, who are comfortable with this level of torture because they insist these tactics were necessary and effective in keeping us \"safe\" (which has also been disputed by the report). \n\nAt the same time, I remember when Bush and Cheney were trying to drum up support for the Iraq War, they cited \"rape rooms\", torture, and other abuses of Iraqis as an emotional appeal to the American public. The image of a woman being subjected to sexual violence by government officials was convincing enough that many parroted these details as a reason why we need to \"liberate\" Iraq. The general consensus was that this sort of treatment is inhumane and would fall under the realm of \"crimes against humanity\".\n\nNow, there aren't many high profile women working within terrorist groups, though they do exist. Would the same people who are comfortable with the treatment of male detainees be comfortable subjecting Samantha Lewthwaite, AKA the \"white widow\", to the same conditions to source information from her?\n\nWhat about other extremist groups? White supremacists/neo nazis, militant environmental groups, Chechen rebels, etc, etc. \n\nOf course, I'm completely opposed to any form of torture. Once it's sanctioned for one purpose to save lives, why not another?  But even if it's kept within the limited realm of the CIA, it seems this behavior is acceptable to commit against men, but would be labelled as a war crime if this was done to women.\n\nPerhaps it is because men are more commonly associated with terrorism. Perhaps it is because we view sexual violence against women to be somehow \"worse\" than it is for men. Regardless of the reasoning, the fact that sexual violence is an acceptable interrogation tool against men, but not for women, is incredibly sexist and wrong. \n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmu6fio", "body": "Systematic rape is a pretty typical part of war, often even a *strategy* in war.

Much of the outrage towards the torture outlined in the CIA report was due to rape and sexual assault as a torture method. OP states right of the bat that this is what she's addressing. And it is a hypothetical about women, because we know how we've responded to this case involving men. It's the outrage towards women being sexually abused by the CIA as a form of torture that's pure speculation.\n\n 4. It *is* pointless, because it relies on so much speculation. If the heart of the problem is sexism, let's talk about sexism.\n\n5. I was wrong, this is perhaps one point where it is relevant that OP is a woman. Clearly she's not trying to feel victimized here.  Regardless, I've heard very similar arguments time and time again by MRA types that *do* want to feel victimized. It's an effective tool for that, because it's an argument set up to be dominated by emotions and feelings, rather than facts, because it's hypothetical and speculative. There's no facts that can refute such a hypothetical. \n\n7. Instances of our military and government using rape and sexual abuse as a weapon of war have been ignored our entire history. We raped *our allies* during WWI and WWII. We raped everyone in Korea and Vietnam. We've raped in Iraq and Afghanistan. There's no outrage over that. Conceptually, Gitmo is no more close to home or remote than Afghanistan. Neither are on our soil. The CIA wasn't sodomizing Americans. \n\nAnd this does have a bearing because it's our best indicator. You can't say a hypothetical isn't pointless, then say the closest thing to proof we have in the situation is irrelevant because it's not the same as the circumstances happening. No duh. That's because we're dealing with a hypothetical. \n\n7. Realistically, I don't think you could. Our politicians aren't interested in pursuing justice. Not because we were raping men, but because it's politically messy. Republicans want to downplay it, because it was their guy with their rubber stamp that okayed it, and Dems don't want to pursue it because it will look like they're on a political witch hunt. And the media has given it just enough lip service to make sure everyone knows they don't agree with it. It's like that dude on South Park. \"Sodomizing prisoners is bad, mmmkay.\"\n\nYou keep pointing out that quote like it's a smoking gun. Yet I offered it up front and justified it so that I couldn't be backed into the corner you're trying to back me into. I'll spell it out real clear for you.\n\nRape and sexual abuse are used as a weapon of war against men, although on a much smaller scale than against women.\n\nConflict rape of men gets almost no attention. \n\nConflict rape of women, a much bigger issue, gets more attention. \n\nThis attention is from academics, NGOs, and the UN. This attention isn't really from the media or society. It's not what I'd consider \"outrage\". The average Joe doesn't give a shit.\n\nThe CIA torture report has received both attention and outrage. Most of that attention and outrage seems directed towards the use of sexual abuse and rape as a way of torturing male prisoners.\n\nGiven the history of attention and outrage both towards conflict rape of men and conflict rape of women (basically none), it makes no sense to assume that outrage would be greater in this situation if the victims were women. The situation has already received more attention than you could expect.\n\nIt's like if I'm getting a coke from a vending machine and 2 come out. But I think, \" Gee, last time that happened, I was getting a Fanta! I bet if I had hit the Fanta button this time, I would've gotten 3!\" That's illogical.

I'm getting some aggressive PMs accusing me of being a trolling woman-bashing MRA guy who thinks men are always the victim of women. \n\nI don't know how to change the details of this CMV to more clearly illustrate my point that, in American society, male victims of sexual assault receive less sympathy than women, at least partially because men are expected to be strong, dominant protectors, not victims. That's NOT to say that women receive \"too much sympathy\", only that everyone deserves a support system and justice, and men are less likely to receive it in this instance for various cultural reasons. As a result, I think the fact that the United States government used rape as a war tactic is less shocking to the public because the victims were men, and not women. \n_____\n\n\"Prisoners were subjected to 'rectal feeding' without medical necessity. Rectal exams were conducted with 'excessive force'. The report highlights one prisoner later diagnosed with anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids and 'symptomatic rectal prolapse'.\"\n\nSource: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal\n\nOk. If it was reported that a female detainee was sodomized with medical devices so frequently and so forcefully that she suffered a torn anus and her intestines were spilling out of her ass, I doubt Dick Cheney would proudly promise \"And I'd do it again!\" when asked about authorizing these tactics.\n\nDetainees were often kept naked, were beaten, waterboarded, chained and forced to stand in stress positions for up to a week at a time. And there are probably many more horrors that we will never know about. An interrogator and torturer at Abu Ghraib said of the Senate report's details, \"I\u2019m not surprised. I assure you there is more; much remains redacted.\"\n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/opinion/the-torture-report-reminds-us-of-what-america-was.html?_r=1&amp;referrer=\n\nAs heinous as all this is, there are some: the folks at Fox News (and at least some of their viewers), former VP Cheney, and some members of Congress, who are comfortable with this level of torture because they insist these tactics were necessary and effective in keeping us \"safe\" (which has also been disputed by the report). \n\nAt the same time, I remember when Bush and Cheney were trying to drum up support for the Iraq War, they cited \"rape rooms\", torture, and other abuses of Iraqis as an emotional appeal to the American public. The image of a woman being subjected to sexual violence by government officials was convincing enough that many parroted these details as a reason why we need to \"liberate\" Iraq. The general consensus was that this sort of treatment is inhumane and would fall under the realm of \"crimes against humanity\".\n\nNow, there aren't many high profile women working within terrorist groups, though they do exist. Would the same people who are comfortable with the treatment of male detainees be comfortable subjecting Samantha Lewthwaite, AKA the \"white widow\", to the same conditions to source information from her?\n\nWhat about other extremist groups? White supremacists/neo nazis, militant environmental groups, Chechen rebels, etc, etc. \n\nOf course, I'm completely opposed to any form of torture. Once it's sanctioned for one purpose to save lives, why not another?  But even if it's kept within the limited realm of the CIA, it seems this behavior is acceptable to commit against men, but would be labelled as a war crime if this was done to women.\n\nPerhaps it is because men are more commonly associated with terrorism. Perhaps it is because we view sexual violence against women to be somehow \"worse\" than it is for men. Regardless of the reasoning, the fact that sexual violence is an acceptable interrogation tool against men, but not for women, is incredibly sexist and wrong. \n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmt73bm", "body": "**1st counterpoint**\nI would like to counterpoint that nobody really cares that the CIA tortured people, everyone knows they tortured people, only a stupid person doesn't.

Well I say if they were women they wouldn't have been detained and tortured without trial for half the time since women tend to serve half a man's sentence for the same crime; and in better jails!

I doubt anyone arguing in favor of these \"enhanced\" tactics in the name of \"national security\" would advocate raping women for information.  \n\nEDIT: I didn't think I'd have to put this here, but apparently it needs to be noted: I'm a woman, a feminist, and a rape survivor. I'm getting some aggressive PMs accusing me of being a trolling woman-bashing MRA guy who thinks men are always the victim of women. \n\nI don't know how to change the details of this CMV to more clearly illustrate my point that, in American society, male victims of sexual assault receive less sympathy than women, at least partially because men are expected to be strong, dominant protectors, not victims. That's NOT to say that women receive \"too much sympathy\", only that everyone deserves a support system and justice, and men are less likely to receive it in this instance for various cultural reasons. As a result, I think the fact that the United States government used rape as a war tactic is less shocking to the public because the victims were men, and not women. \n_____\n\n\"Prisoners were subjected to 'rectal feeding' without medical necessity. Rectal exams were conducted with 'excessive force'. The report highlights one prisoner later diagnosed with anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids and 'symptomatic rectal prolapse'.\"\n\nSource: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal\n\nOk. If it was reported that a female detainee was sodomized with medical devices so frequently and so forcefully that she suffered a torn anus and her intestines were spilling out of her ass, I doubt Dick Cheney would proudly promise \"And I'd do it again!\" when asked about authorizing these tactics.\n\nDetainees were often kept naked, were beaten, waterboarded, chained and forced to stand in stress positions for up to a week at a time. And there are probably many more horrors that we will never know about. An interrogator and torturer at Abu Ghraib said of the Senate report's details, \"I\u2019m not surprised. I assure you there is more; much remains redacted.\"\n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/opinion/the-torture-report-reminds-us-of-what-america-was.html?_r=1&amp;referrer=\n\nAs heinous as all this is, there are some: the folks at Fox News (and at least some of their viewers), former VP Cheney, and some members of Congress, who are comfortable with this level of torture because they insist these tactics were necessary and effective in keeping us \"safe\" (which has also been disputed by the report). \n\nAt the same time, I remember when Bush and Cheney were trying to drum up support for the Iraq War, they cited \"rape rooms\", torture, and other abuses of Iraqis as an emotional appeal to the American public. The image of a woman being subjected to sexual violence by government officials was convincing enough that many parroted these details as a reason why we need to \"liberate\" Iraq. The general consensus was that this sort of treatment is inhumane and would fall under the realm of \"crimes against humanity\".\n\nNow, there aren't many high profile women working within terrorist groups, though they do exist. Would the same people who are comfortable with the treatment of male detainees be comfortable subjecting Samantha Lewthwaite, AKA the \"white widow\", to the same conditions to source information from her?\n\nWhat about other extremist groups? White supremacists/neo nazis, militant environmental groups, Chechen rebels, etc, etc. \n\nOf course, I'm completely opposed to any form of torture. Once it's sanctioned for one purpose to save lives, why not another?  But even if it's kept within the limited realm of the CIA, it seems this behavior is acceptable to commit against men, but would be labelled as a war crime if this was done to women.\n\nPerhaps it is because men are more commonly associated with terrorism. Perhaps it is because we view sexual violence against women to be somehow \"worse\" than it is for men. Regardless of the reasoning, the fact that sexual violence is an acceptable interrogation tool against men, but not for women, is incredibly sexist and wrong. \n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmtb6dd", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cmtb6dd", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cmtbh67", "body": "Really?

Meanwhile you are blocking an entire lane (usually two) in the parking lot, preventing other people from getting around you.\n\nWhy don't these people just drive into the spot head first?  If the argument is that it makes leaving the spot easier, my rebuttal is that its far easier to pull out of a spot in reverse (going from a tight enclosed space to a bigger one) than it is to back into a tight little parking spot.

First, it is actually sometimes the smart thing to do, if you know how to back a car up into a spot.  It allows you to see better when exiting the parking spot.  This however, doesn't seem to be the normal reasoning to me.  The majority of people I see doing this do not do it with any skill and I highly doubt that they are doing so because they are responsible or cautious drivers. I live in Memphis, TN and have noticed that the more ghetto the driver, the more likely to back into a spot they are.  I know that sounds awfully racist, but it's just what I have observed throughout my life.  I've had two theories as to why this happens.  the first is that perhaps people do it in case they need to make a quick getaway.  Sounds like a fun idea, but I think it's pretty stupid. The second, and the one I've decided is the closest to truth is that people have been doing it for a long long time and the original purpose was to hide expired tags, or just to hide the tags in general to avoid police notice, but this purpose has been forgotten over time.

The main reason that I see for backing into a parking spot is people (myself included) have trucks. When driving a truck it is far easier to back into a parking spot then it is to pull forward into a spot. This is largely due to the fact that the bed on a truck doesn't move as easy when entering a spot forward as when entering a spot in reverse. Additionally, its actually quicker to back a truck into a spot because you are more likely to hit the right angle the first time backing in then pulling in forward. I personally have found it harder to back out of spots because new cars parking in the lot since I parked. If they are at all into the aisle then backing out is a 30 point turn ordeal that is more likely to lead me to accidently back into another vehicle than if I were simply to back into the spot in the first place. I also don't regularly see people miss the fact that a person is going to back into the spot, either because that person has their blinker on or you actually see them pull towards one side of the row (indicating they are going to back into a spot and not simply that they suck at driving).
