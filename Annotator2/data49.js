In here our assumptions of how a the mathematical object of \"set\" behaves leads to a contradiction.\n\n* **Premise**: An \"axiom.\" Something that we assume to be true. If certain axioms lead to a contradiction, then our assumption that they are true is wrong and the axioms are false in \"objective reality.\"\n\nIf we're looking at it this way, then Godel's Incompleteness Theorems are real interesting to think about. The first page of [this](http://math.ucsb.edu/~padraic/ucsb_2013_14/mathcs103_s2014/mathcs103_s2014_taom_presentation.pdf) is a nice layman's summary.

Included are police forces and courts.  Anarcho-capitalists and some libertarians believe the free market can set up a working system of private security forces and courts.  I believe the outcomes of a free market security and legal system would be unacceptably bad for most people.  I believe government-sponsored legal systems are far less likely to be biased and more likely to deliver accurate judgments based on the law.  Government-sponsored security forces, for all their failings, are more likely to treat people fairly under the law and prevent violence between security forces.\n\nThe central problem is competition.  Under certain circumstances, market competition leads to improved outcomes.  In the case of security and legal systems, competition would lead to bad outcomes.\n\n------------------------\n\nLet\u2019s consider free-market courts first.   People prefer a court biased towards them over a fair court.  Even if you believe your case is strong, why risk it?  To attract business, courts have a financial incentive to be biased towards whoever picks the court.  Let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n* If plaintiffs pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of plaintiffs.\n* If defendants pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of defendants.\n\nIf both parties must agree on the court, it depends on who faces lower penalties if they can\u2019t reach an agreement:\n\n* If the defendant suffers less than the plaintiff (e.g. no agreement = no trial), then the defendant would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the defendant.\n* If the plaintiff suffers less (e.g. no agreement = defendant suffers some punishment), then the plaintiff would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nThis isn\u2019t simply a theoretical observation: [forum shopping]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_shopping) exists.  Jurisdiction limits combined with regional monopolies, as well as government courts not directly motivated by profit, means this problem is much smaller in the present-day system than in a free market legal system.  We see much larger concerns regarding bias in binding arbitration, where there is free entry and companies can hire any arbitration company it wants.  There is pressure on binding arbitration companies to favor the companies which hired them.\n\n-------------------------\n\nFree market security forces are also problematic.  Again, individuals and institutions would rather hire a security force which will always defend them rather than a fair security force.  This means rich individuals and corporations can hire a strong security force to bully people and institutions with weaker security forces.  This is more expensive, but [rich people have lots of money]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States#Wealth_distribution).  It\u2019s also not too hard to find people who are willing to use force.  Gangs are full of people who are willing to use force and possibly die at low prices.  Free market security companies exist today, but they are overpowered by the government\u2019s security forces.  Abusing their power would get them smacked down by the local police force or the army.\n\nEven without discrepancies in power, there are other problems with free market security forces.  They could devolve into regional monopolies anyway.  It\u2019s easier to guard a certain region in town than to guard many spread-out areas in town.  It can also be hard for a new security firm to challenge an incumbent\u2019s existing relationships, supply lines, and firepower.\n\nSecurity forces may also disagree on the rules they enforce.  Security company ACME might be hired specifically because they do X, while security company Beta might be hired specifically because they do not-X.  Either company would lose all of their customers if they changed their policy.  The only way for these companies to not come into armed conflict would be if ACME could buy out all security companies which do not-X, or vice versa.\n\nA free market in security means if someone can\u2019t hire a security force, they are fair game to be killed.  That person might be poor, or maybe all the security companies available hate that person.\n\n-----\n\nWhat can change my view?  Construct a free-market system under which private courts and security companies produce good outcomes.  Alternatively, you can rigorously show why my arguments above are incorrect.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Government-sponsored security forces, for all their failings, are more likely to treat people fairly under the law and prevent violence between security forces.\n\nThe central problem is competition.  Under certain circumstances, market competition leads to improved outcomes.  In the case of security and legal systems, competition would lead to bad outcomes.\n\n------------------------\n\nLet\u2019s consider free-market courts first.   People prefer a court biased towards them over a fair court.  Even if you believe your case is strong, why risk it?  To attract business, courts have a financial incentive to be biased towards whoever picks the court.  Let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n* If plaintiffs pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of plaintiffs.\n* If defendants pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of defendants.\n\nIf both parties must agree on the court, it depends on who faces lower penalties if they can\u2019t reach an agreement:\n\n* If the defendant suffers less than the plaintiff (e.g. no agreement = no trial), then the defendant would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the defendant.\n* If the plaintiff suffers less (e.g. no agreement = defendant suffers some punishment), then the plaintiff would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nThis isn\u2019t simply a theoretical observation: [forum shopping]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_shopping) exists.  Jurisdiction limits combined with regional monopolies, as well as government courts not directly motivated by profit, means this problem is much smaller in the present-day system than in a free market legal system.  We see much larger concerns regarding bias in binding arbitration, where there is free entry and companies can hire any arbitration company it wants.  There is pressure on binding arbitration companies to favor the companies which hired them.\n\n-------------------------\n\nFree market security forces are also problematic.  Again, individuals and institutions would rather hire a security force which will always defend them rather than a fair security force.  This means rich individuals and corporations can hire a strong security force to bully people and institutions with weaker security forces.  This is more expensive, but [rich people have lots of money]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States#Wealth_distribution).  It\u2019s also not too hard to find people who are willing to use force.  Gangs are full of people who are willing to use force and possibly die at low prices.  Free market security companies exist today, but they are overpowered by the government\u2019s security forces.  Abusing their power would get them smacked down by the local police force or the army.\n\nEven without discrepancies in power, there are other problems with free market security forces.  They could devolve into regional monopolies anyway.  It\u2019s easier to guard a certain region in town than to guard many spread-out areas in town.  It can also be hard for a new security firm to challenge an incumbent\u2019s existing relationships, supply lines, and firepower.\n\nSecurity forces may also disagree on the rules they enforce.  Security company ACME might be hired specifically because they do X, while security company Beta might be hired specifically because they do not-X.  Either company would lose all of their customers if they changed their policy.  The only way for these companies to not come into armed conflict would be if ACME could buy out all security companies which do not-X, or vice versa.\n\nA free market in security means if someone can\u2019t hire a security force, they are fair game to be killed.  That person might be poor, or maybe all the security companies available hate that person.\n\n-----\n\nWhat can change my view?  Construct a free-market system under which private courts and security companies produce good outcomes.  Alternatively, you can rigorously show why my arguments above are incorrect.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It is a globally distributed network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks.

Its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international multistakeholder network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, the academic and research communities and national and international organizations.

They rely on people spending their money on them, voluntarily, in stark contrast to a government.

As an individual though, you are completely powerless. Your vote is not going to have an effect on anything. The opportunity costs alone make voting irrational, unless you enjoy voting for some reason.\n\nI've already made a basic argument for free markets, and against centralization and monopolization.

Do you think that without this 1990's looking document, or any of the people wrote it can control anything? \n\nAs the wikipedia entry on Internet Governance states:\n\n&gt;No one person, company, organization or government runs the Internet. It is a globally distributed network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body with each constituent network setting and enforcing its own policies. Its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international multistakeholder network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, the academic and research communities and national and international organizations. They work cooperatively from their respective roles to create shared policies and standards that maintain the Internet's global interoperability for the public good.\n\n&gt;It doesn't matter how many people become outraged, it matters how much power they have. In your proposed system, if they have no money, they have no power. In the current system, they at least have votes.\nThe current system works reasonably well.

Convince me why your free market system would work well, beyond \"let's hope for the best\".\n\nPR can make or break a business. They rely on people spending their money on them, voluntarily, in stark contrast to a government.

As an individual though, you are completely powerless. Your vote is not going to have an effect on anything. The opportunity costs alone make voting irrational, unless you enjoy voting for some reason.\n\nI've already made a basic argument for free markets, and against centralization and monopolization.

A claim for damages was a piece of transferable property. If you had injured me and I was too weak to enforce my claim, I could sell or give it to someone stronger. It was then in his interest to enforce the claim in order both to collect the damages and to establish his own reputation for use in future conflicts.\n\n&gt;The victim, in such a situation, gives up part or all of the damages, but he gets something more important in exchange \u2014a demonstration that anyone who injures him will pay for it. The point is made in a more permanent sense if it is clear that the same person who enforced this claim would do so under similar circumstances again. The powerful individual who took over such claims and enforced them might be a chieftain acting for one of his thingmen or he might be merely a local farmer with a lot of friends.\n\nThis is one possible, very simple solution to this problem that you people think is some sort of \"aha, got you now fucker!\" problem that no libertarian anarchist has ever thought of before. \n\nAlso, look around you.

"}, {"id": "cmkqdvy", "body": "I'm going to focus specifically on the question of private security services for this answer its a tad simpler to answer.\n\nLets make one assumption that I feel is reasonable: in a free market security industry, the people making up the employees of the security agencies would be largely the same as the people making up the employees of public security agencies in the current system. That is to say, the people who are police officers and detectives and the like now would likely *also* be the security officers and detectives and such in a private system, only difference being the business model under which they operate (privately funded vs. tax funded). \n\nSo this should mostly lay to rest the question  \"who will do the policing?\" If there are people willing and able to be police in the current system, they will be willing to do it in other systems.\n\nWith the big glaring difference being that the the private police **will not** receive any sort of special privileges just by nature of wearing a badge. Which is to say since there isn't a single monolithic government providing your services (specifically courts and policing) then if a private security officer screws up and kills or injures an innocent person they are **not** shielded from the consequences just by nature of being an agent of the state.\n\nThis makes it *substantially* more likely that those wrongfully hurt by the security agents will actually be compensated. This ALSO provided a disincentive for the police to overstep their bounds in doing their jobs, and makes it more risky to have violent employees. This helps align the interests of the security agents with the interests of those they're serving, rather than turning to hostilities.\n\nIts ALSO worth considering that in a private system, the police **would not** be pursuing victimless crimes like drug consumption, prostitution, or anything where there is no 'victim' to report a crime and pay for its cessation. Not only wold this free up police resources to focus on violent crimes and property crimes... it would make the security services **cheaper** since they're not wasting gobs of money arresting nonviolent individuals. \n\nThis would likely make security services *even more affordable* for the average person or even the poorer people and would also take away the threat on the poor of being arrested for the petty 'crimes' that would otherwise cause them to be locked up for no good reason.\n\nAnd all of that is just assuming that we make the police private and just remove their special privileges. It doesn't consider what might happen if there is sufficient competition to drive innovation.\n\nSpeaking of:\n\nAnd here's a big question for you when it comes to competition:\n\nWhat is the **proper** price for security services?

That is to say, the people who are police officers and detectives and the like now would likely *also* be the security officers and detectives and such in a private system, only difference being the business model under which they operate (privately funded vs. tax funded). \n\nSo this should mostly lay to rest the question  \"who will do the policing?\" If there are people willing and able to be police in the current system, they will be willing to do it in other systems.\n\nWith the big glaring difference being that the the private police **will not** receive any sort of special privileges just by nature of wearing a badge. Which is to say since there isn't a single monolithic government providing your services (specifically courts and policing) then if a private security officer screws up and kills or injures an innocent person they are **not** shielded from the consequences just by nature of being an agent of the state.\n\nThis makes it *substantially* more likely that those wrongfully hurt by the security agents will actually be compensated. This ALSO provided a disincentive for the police to overstep their bounds in doing their jobs, and makes it more risky to have violent employees. This helps align the interests of the security agents with the interests of those they're serving, rather than turning to hostilities.\n\nIts ALSO worth considering that in a private system, the police **would not** be pursuing victimless crimes like drug consumption, prostitution, or anything where there is no 'victim' to report a crime and pay for its cessation. Not only wold this free up police resources to focus on violent crimes and property crimes... it would make the security services **cheaper** since they're not wasting gobs of money arresting nonviolent individuals. \n\nThis would likely make security services *even more affordable* for the average person or even the poorer people and would also take away the threat on the poor of being arrested for the petty 'crimes' that would otherwise cause them to be locked up for no good reason.\n\nAnd all of that is just assuming that we make the police private and just remove their special privileges. It doesn't consider what might happen if there is sufficient competition to drive innovation.\n\nSpeaking of:\n\nAnd here's a big question for you when it comes to competition:\n\nWhat is the **proper** price for security services?

If those sorts of results are what people *want* then they will pay for it willingly.\n\nIn that case, when two different clients of the firm come into conflict, the firm isn't going to fight *itself,* it can just refer the contracts it formed with those clients to resolve it.\n\n Otherwise, if not enough people prefer it then it will become a very expensive firm to hire since it fights with EVERY other firm at each opportunity. So it either becomes popular, or its expenses drive it out of business.\n\n&gt;For one thing, people (perhaps having hired an unscrupulous security firm) can make up harms that they've received. \n\nPossible in the current system to, but we'll run with it.\n\n&gt; Rich people also need to protect themselves from other rich people. Having a strong security force also has other benefits, such as breaking a prospective competitor's knees.\n\nI'm not quite sure what you're getting at, are you saying rich people will hire firms that go after and injure other rich folks?\n\n&gt;gang members fight and die all the time, yet they're hardly well-paid.\n\nWith the exception of the really well-organized ones, I should point out the activities that gang members engage in (drug production and sales, prostitution) for funding would not be illegal in a private system, most of the violence between these groups is driven by the *fact that they cannot use legal conflict resolution methods.* If a person or group steals your product you can't take them to court so you have to get you and your buddies to go pop a cap in them to get what they took.\n\nSo I think the incentives for violence will be *slightly* different when peaceful conflict resolution is allowed.\n\n&gt;Or a higher court investigates the situation. Or the national government with an army steps in. The present system has checks and balances.\n\nAnd why not create even more checks and balances by creating a more decentralized system? \n\nDo you think that there could plausibly be any one firm that reaches the size of the U.S. Federal government? And if not, doesn't that indicate that there will be significant room for competing firms that can provide a check on the powers of the others?\n\n This is the point I mean about more methods of recourse. Each one of the methods you proffered *still requires you to play by the rules of the monopolistic governmental entity.* If you find that acceptable I really don't mind. What I mind is that you impose that system on *me* as well. I'd like to be allowed to opt out and try my own system to see if I like it better. \n\n&gt;Rich people today still live in fear of the law. In a free market system, rich people will be the law.\n\nFunny, but from my view of things, that's pretty much already happened. The [majority of congress is millionaires](http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/01/10/261398205/majority-in-congress-are-millionaires) and don't even get me started on the [heads of regulatory agencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) and the biggest lobbyists. Likewise, the government gets [The vast majority of its funds from the richest 1% in the country,](http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/04/pf/taxes/top-1-taxes/) yet we should assume it doesn't give them the favor of its laws? Suffice it to say the government didn't bail out the banks because they hate the rich.\n\nI only bring this up in attempt to shake you of what I perceive as [Status Quo bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias) by pointing out that the features you seem to fear about a privatized security situation are already present in the current one, so you can do a slightly more objective comparison.\n\nI think your one BIG problem with this argument is the assumption that somehow all the rich people will have one unified agenda of screwing over the poor, rather than a diversity of goals. It ALSO presumes that they would *willingly* spend their money on attacking each other and the poorest people rather than investing in businesses and such *which is how most of them got rich in the first place.*\n\n So why do you think that the rich can be trusted to reign themselves in when they have access to a huge monopolistic government that is forced on everyone but won't do so when there are numerous competing firms and freer choice amongst consumers?"}, {"id": "cml2z5s", "body": "&gt;Do you think that criminals, fundamentalists, and paranoid people are a significant and wealthy enough segment of the population to afford to do this, versus everybody else?  If so, isn't this a horrible omen for a democratic system? What keeps the criminals, fundamentalists, and paranoiacs from simply voting to achieve the violence they want?\n\nAbsolutely, especially in smaller regions!  See gangs in Mexico, see the Mafia, see concentrated religions like the Mormon Church, see religions which have lots of rich people like Scientology.  These are organizations that have more wealth but fewer people.  In a democratic country, they are also subject to national laws and can't simply take over a region.\n\n&gt;That may be true, but if so what happens if most people simply start preferring that company. If those sorts of results are what people want then they will pay for it willingly.  In that case, when two different clients of the firm come into conflict, the firm isn't going to fight itself, it can just refer the contracts it formed with those clients to resolve it.\n\nThat's fine.  It'll still fight with other firms.  Alternatively, only one firm will survive, and we're back to a monopoly, except this one doesn't care about democracy and votes.  I don't think this is an acceptable outcome.\n\n&gt;Otherwise, if not enough people prefer it then it will become a very expensive firm to hire since it fights with EVERY other firm at each opportunity. So it either becomes popular, or its expenses drive it out of business.\n\nKeep in mind it raises the expenses of every other firm as well.  I'm also not convinced it's that expensive -- gangs fight with other \"security organizations\" today, and those are hardly unaffordable institutions.\n\n&gt;I'm not quite sure what you're getting at, are you saying rich people will hire firms that go after and injure other rich folks?\n\nI think they're more worried about another rich person using his army to take their stuff.\n\n&gt;With the exception of the really well-organized ones, I should point out the activities that gang members engage in (drug production and sales, prostitution) for funding would not be illegal in a private system, most of the violence between these groups is driven by the fact that they cannot use legal conflict resolution methods. If a person or group steals your product you can't take them to court so you have to get you and your buddies to go pop a cap in them to get what they took.\n\nFunding sources would have to change, but gang members are paid shockingly little.  Some people just have poor job prospects (perhaps due to behavioral problems or poor parenting and education), and that's not going to change if we eliminate the government.\n\n&gt;And why not create even more checks and balances by creating a more decentralized system?  Do you think that there could plausibly be any one firm that reaches the size of the U.S. Federal government? And if not, doesn't that indicate that there will be significant room for competing firms that can provide a check on the powers of the others?\n\nBecause there are no built-in checks and balances in a decentralized system.  The only check is to have a stronger army.  One security firm could conceivably grow as large as the federal government.  Would it allow for elections and create a Constitution which gives people rights?  Doubtful.  That's called a military dictatorship.  If it's several large security companies, that's a bunch of small military dictatorships.\n\n&gt;Funny, but from my view of things, that's pretty much already happened. The majority of congress is millionaires and don't even get me started on the heads of regulatory agencies and the biggest lobbyists. Likewise, the government gets The vast majority of its funds from the richest 1% in the country, yet we should assume it doesn't give them the favor of its laws? Suffice it to say the government didn't bail out the banks because they hate the rich.\n\nYes, but poor people matter -- look at how much they spend on campaigns to convince poor people to vote for them.  If anything, money should have less influence over policy -- the opposite of the free market proposal.\n\n&gt;I think your one BIG problem with this argument is the assumption that somehow all the rich people will have one unified agenda of screwing over the poor, rather than a diversity of goals. It ALSO presumes that they would willingly spend their money on attacking each other and the poorest people rather than investing in businesses and such which is how most of them got rich in the first place.\n\nTheir agendas don't have to be unified.  The simple fact is their wealth lets them hire large armies, and that armies will reflect their will.  These armies are only checked by other large armies, so if you're rich, you better have a large army to defend your stuff.  How can the poor get their interests represented?"}, {"id": "2o7c65", "body": "Anarcho-capitalists believe we should abolish the government and let the free market provide all goods and services.

I believe government-sponsored legal systems are far less likely to be biased and more likely to deliver accurate judgments based on the law.

People prefer a court biased towards them over a fair court.  Even if you believe your case is strong, why risk it?  To attract business, courts have a financial incentive to be biased towards whoever picks the court.  Let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n* If plaintiffs pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of plaintiffs.\n* If defendants pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of defendants.\n\nIf both parties must agree on the court, it depends on who faces lower penalties if they can\u2019t reach an agreement:\n\n* If the defendant suffers less than the plaintiff (e.g. no agreement = no trial), then the defendant would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the defendant.\n* If the plaintiff suffers less (e.g. no agreement = defendant suffers some punishment), then the plaintiff would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nThis isn\u2019t simply a theoretical observation: [forum shopping]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_shopping) exists.  Jurisdiction limits combined with regional monopolies, as well as government courts not directly motivated by profit, means this problem is much smaller in the present-day system than in a free market legal system.  We see much larger concerns regarding bias in binding arbitration, where there is free entry and companies can hire any arbitration company it wants.  There is pressure on binding arbitration companies to favor the companies which hired them.\n\n-------------------------\n\nFree market security forces are also problematic.  Again, individuals and institutions would rather hire a security force which will always defend them rather than a fair security force.  This means rich individuals and corporations can hire a strong security force to bully people and institutions with weaker security forces.  This is more expensive, but [rich people have lots of money]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States#Wealth_distribution).  It\u2019s also not too hard to find people who are willing to use force.  Gangs are full of people who are willing to use force and possibly die at low prices.  Free market security companies exist today, but they are overpowered by the government\u2019s security forces.  Abusing their power would get them smacked down by the local police force or the army.\n\nEven without discrepancies in power, there are other problems with free market security forces.  They could devolve into regional monopolies anyway.  It\u2019s easier to guard a certain region in town than to guard many spread-out areas in town.  It can also be hard for a new security firm to challenge an incumbent\u2019s existing relationships, supply lines, and firepower.\n\nSecurity forces may also disagree on the rules they enforce.  Security company ACME might be hired specifically because they do X, while security company Beta might be hired specifically because they do not-X.  Either company would lose all of their customers if they changed their policy.  The only way for these companies to not come into armed conflict would be if ACME could buy out all security companies which do not-X, or vice versa.\n\nA free market in security means if someone can\u2019t hire a security force, they are fair game to be killed.  That person might be poor, or maybe all the security companies available hate that person.\n\n-----\n\nWhat can change my view?

I don't believe this would necessarily be the case. First, more than one judge can hear a case. For example, you could have 1 judge that is a part of the plaintiff's law organization hear the case, as well as a judge from the defendent's organization. There are a few possibilities here. If they agree on the outcome, there is no issue. If they do not agree, then it can be taken to a third arbitrating judge who is a part of neither organization. Perhaps in very important or large cases it could even be agreed upon to have say, 2 judges from each organization hear the case, followed by 1 or even 2 or 3 neutral judges.

In a monopolistic court system, a corrupt court, law makers, or security personnel can be very very difficult to bring to justice as they are investigating and disciplining members of their own organization and have a large incentive not to prosecute.

Around 5:00 is the specific part tho you should watch the whole video) Security companies would also almost certainly act to prevent crime even if it is not directly related to their customers as this lowers crime in general, creates a better atmosphere for their customers, is a preventative measure for crime, and is simply part of why they were hired."}, {"id": "cml1lhs", "body": "&gt;In your first main point about free-market courts, you speak of 'picking a court' and your argument revolves around people picking courts that are biased towards them. [...] If they do not agree, then it can be taken to a third arbitrating judge who is a part of neither organization.\n\nThis doesn't solve the problem: who picks the third judge?\n\n&gt;Neither of us have data on what the percentage of people is that would purposefully hire a biased and therefore criminal organization rather than an honest one, so I believe your point is very difficult to prove.\n\nFor rich people who can hire a private security company for themselves, I think the easiest comparison would be extremely powerful national leaders (e.g. dictators) or gang leaders.  These are people who have the chance to create their own sovereign security force.  I think you'd agree these people generally don't create \"fair\" security forces.  Sometimes their security force overthrows them, but that's not usually due to reasons of fairness.\n\n&gt;Yes, some courts and judges would be corrupt, yes some security agencies would be corrupt. However, at the very least, there are other uncorrupt courts, judges, and security agencies to which people can turn to protect themselves. In a monopolistic system, this is not the case.\n\nIn a free market system, there is no way for a corrupt institution and an honest institution to come to an agreement other than to fight it out, assuming the corrupt institution is not willing to negotiate fairly and the honest institution is not willing to abandon its principles.  In the present system, there are checks and balances: you can appeal to a superior court, you can start a grassroots campaign to elect a new judge, you can try to bring in national attention, you can try to persuade Congress to establish new rules, etc.\n\n&gt;Yes, there are certain advantages gained by being first to market, and the incumbent firm is often going to be hard to oust from a region and is able to take advantage of this. However, it is MUCH harder to remove a government in the case where it is corrupt than to remove an incumbent firm.  Keep in mind as well that the capital investment needed by a security firm is really quite low.\n\nAgain, there are ways to create change in governments from within the system.  The barrier to entry for a new security firm is actually quite high: it needs to credibly challenge the existing security firm's forces, otherwise it's effectively useless if it comes down to a fight, and thus has a very weak position to negotiate from.\n\n&gt;In reality you would certainly never lose ALL your customers by changing one policy. You may lose some, certainly, but not all. Secondly, this is only a concern when it involves specifically a member of company A being in a dispute with company B on that particular issue.\n\nLet's say I'm a fundamentalist Christian, and I hire a security company which promises to enforce God's laws (this security force also caters to similar fundamentalist Christians).  I don't want any compromise from this company -- it doesn't have the authority to change God's laws!  Indeed, the security force may employ many fundamentalists and may not be willing to negotiate on its rules.  Similarly, a security firm which caters to criminals might not be willing to negotiate.  A security firm which caters to the rich might have the firepower to resist negotiation (or might have a lot of bargaining power), and has a lot to lose if they don't defend their customers fully.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be so extreme.  According to your view, there's free entry.  People who disagree with the policy change can start up a new security firm which is exactly the same as the old one, except different on that one point.  The old firm would lose a lot of customers that way, and there's now a new security firm which is not willing to negotiate.\n\n&gt;First, why can't charity organizations exist to protect those on the margins? [...] Security companies would also almost certainly act to prevent crime even if it is not directly related to their customers as this lowers crime in general, creates a better atmosphere for their customers, is a preventative measure for crime, and is simply part of why they were hired.\n\nAgain, you're looking only at the security firms which exist under the present-day conditions with a sovereign court system and a national army. A charity organization runs into three problems.  First, it must be able to compete with existing security organizations, and thus must be sufficiently large (a problem if the others are funded by very rich people).  Second, donors can set the rules of this organization, and would likely prevent the security firm from protecting against them.  Why donate to something which can hurt you?  Third, there's a free-rider problem.  Individual donors are unlikely to significantly affect the success of the organization.  Thus, these services are likely to be underfunded.\n\nIn a free market system with free entry, security companies would not be able to prevent crime no related to their customers.  It increases their costs without increasing their profits.  They'd likely have to deal with the criminal's own security company.  With costly entry, it might be possible, but again, why would companies do this?  It still raises their costs without raising their profits."}, {"id": "2o7c65", "body": "Anarcho-capitalists believe we should abolish the government and let the free market provide all goods and services.  Included are police forces and courts.  Anarcho-capitalists and some libertarians believe the free market can set up a working system of private security forces and courts.  I believe the outcomes of a free market security and legal system would be unacceptably bad for most people.  I believe government-sponsored legal systems are far less likely to be biased and more likely to deliver accurate judgments based on the law.  Government-sponsored security forces, for all their failings, are more likely to treat people fairly under the law and prevent violence between security forces.\n\nThe central problem is competition.  Under certain circumstances, market competition leads to improved outcomes.  In the case of security and legal systems, competition would lead to bad outcomes.\n\n------------------------\n\nLet\u2019s consider free-market courts first.   People prefer a court biased towards them over a fair court.  Even if you believe your case is strong, why risk it?  To attract business, courts have a financial incentive to be biased towards whoever picks the court.  Let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n* If plaintiffs pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of plaintiffs.\n* If defendants pick the court, then they would prefer to pick a court which always rules in favor of defendants.\n\nIf both parties must agree on the court, it depends on who faces lower penalties if they can\u2019t reach an agreement:\n\n* If the defendant suffers less than the plaintiff (e.g. no agreement = no trial), then the defendant would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the defendant.\n* If the plaintiff suffers less (e.g. no agreement = defendant suffers some punishment), then the plaintiff would only agree to a court which always rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nThis isn\u2019t simply a theoretical observation: [forum shopping]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_shopping) exists.  Jurisdiction limits combined with regional monopolies, as well as government courts not directly motivated by profit, means this problem is much smaller in the present-day system than in a free market legal system.  We see much larger concerns regarding bias in binding arbitration, where there is free entry and companies can hire any arbitration company it wants.  There is pressure on binding arbitration companies to favor the companies which hired them.\n\n-------------------------\n\nFree market security forces are also problematic.  Again, individuals and institutions would rather hire a security force which will always defend them rather than a fair security force.  This means rich individuals and corporations can hire a strong security force to bully people and institutions with weaker security forces.  This is more expensive, but [rich people have lots of money]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States#Wealth_distribution).  It\u2019s also not too hard to find people who are willing to use force.  Gangs are full of people who are willing to use force and possibly die at low prices.  Free market security companies exist today, but they are overpowered by the government\u2019s security forces.  Abusing their power would get them smacked down by the local police force or the army.\n\nEven without discrepancies in power, there are other problems with free market security forces.  They could devolve into regional monopolies anyway.  It\u2019s easier to guard a certain region in town than to guard many spread-out areas in town.  It can also be hard for a new security firm to challenge an incumbent\u2019s existing relationships, supply lines, and firepower.\n\nSecurity forces may also disagree on the rules they enforce.  Security company ACME might be hired specifically because they do X, while security company Beta might be hired specifically because they do not-X.  Either company would lose all of their customers if they changed their policy.  The only way for these companies to not come into armed conflict would be if ACME could buy out all security companies which do not-X, or vice versa.\n\nA free market in security means if someone can\u2019t hire a security force, they are fair game to be killed.  That person might be poor, or maybe all the security companies available hate that person.\n\n-----\n\nWhat can change my view?

I'm not sure this is still active, but just in case:\n\nBy your argument, it seems like the only thing stopping rich people from conquering parts of an AnCap society is their virtue and self-control.  I don't think you've made the case that CEOs in a free market society would be virtuous.  [Research has found](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/rich-people-just-care-less/?_r=0) rich people have less empathy.  The hypothesis seems to be that rich people don't need a strong social network because of their power from wealth.  This isn't a feature of capitalists just in the current environment.  [This behavior is seen even when wealth is assigned randomly](http://nymag.com/news/features/money-brain-2012-7/).  In other words, power corrupts.  There's further evidence that CEOs are psychopaths at much higher rates than in the general population: [1](http://healthland.time.com/2011/09/20/study-1-in-25-business-leaders-may-be-psychopaths/) [2](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/06/14/why-some-psychopaths-make-great-ceos/).\n\nEven if you're not convinced that rich people are less likely to care about the plight of others, a would-be conqueror doesn't have to have bad intentions.  Conquests could come from thinking they know what's best for everyone and having the power to act on it.  This simply requires arrogance, and I think it's not a stretch to say CEOs can be arrogant.\n\nFinally, suppose for a moment rich people are virtuous.  That doesn't stop the rich person's heir from being a jerk.\n\n&gt;I think you grossly misunderstand how states maintain power \n\nPerhaps, but nothing stops the rich person from using the same tools.

If we look at the medium estimate for both, it is clear that the population will level off at about 9 billion people.  Technological process, however, does not halt.  [Wheat production in developing countries](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Wheat_yields_in_developing_countries_1951-2004.png) has been consistently increasing, and will likely continue to do so (as, once again, agriculture has been improving since its inception).  Raw food production tells only one story, so let's look at the other.  [Food production per capita](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Food_production_per_capita_1961-2005.png) has consistently been increasing.  That means that food production is actually outpacing population growth.  The distribution of this is far from equal, but we are definitely not on the verge of a global food crisis.  There is one more graph about overpopulation I'd like to show you.  It is the [growth rate of the population compared to time](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/World_population_growth_rates_1800-2005.png).  You can see a sharp decrease in the rate of increase of population growth since about 1960.  This confirms the UN studies I linked to before, as it is fairy evident that this growth rate will continue on its trend (we have no reason to believe it won't).\n\n"}, {"id": "cmkhxbg", "body": "So youre okay with over population and basically being a virus to the earth.

As conditions improve in third world countries their growth rate slows down as well. Some places are even experiencing negative growth.

You are taking my stance as a right now thing. We already failed and are doomed, this practice should have been dealt with long before. Breeding selectively would also include fixing issues like that, obviously not right away. Have we been on top for so long that we believe we will never need to resort to our base skills to survive? The internet might also not be around forever, so yes I 100% believe information should be given freely and copyrights abolished. What do we gain from withholding information and knowledge from the people would wish to learn? Why shouldnt we take everyone's opinion at face value? Because we should not be worrying about why a guy's shirt is offensive or why someone is or isn't allowed to modify a uniform to fit their beliefs. Eg - the rcmp officer in Canada who wanted to wear his head piece instead of a hat. People flipped over something that affected no one. News is cluttered with shit like this everyday. Crime should be treated as such. If a few innocent people unfairly die to prevent future murders, ends justify the means. Carpet bombing a house is such an extreme counter. A drug lord who is at a coffee shop and cannot be touched because he out mans and out guns the police is unacceptable. A residential house does not have the ability to over power anyone.

People need someone telling them no, telling them to shut up and not allowing scum to survive."}, {"id": "cmklfi2", "body": "You mention overpopulation quite a lot, so I'll leave a few graphs from the UN and from Wikipedia.\n\nFor one we have a UN prediction of world population until [2050](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf#page=19) and then [2300](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf#page=27).  If we look at the medium estimate for both, it is clear that the population will level off at about 9 billion people.  Technological process, however, does not halt.  [Wheat production in developing countries](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Wheat_yields_in_developing_countries_1951-2004.png) has been consistently increasing, and will likely continue to do so (as, once again, agriculture has been improving since its inception).  Raw food production tells only one story, so let's look at the other.  [Food production per capita](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Food_production_per_capita_1961-2005.png) has consistently been increasing.  That means that food production is actually outpacing population growth.  The distribution of this is far from equal, but we are definitely not on the verge of a global food crisis.  There is one more graph about overpopulation I'd like to show you.  It is the [growth rate of the population compared to time](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/World_population_growth_rates_1800-2005.png).  You can see a sharp decrease in the rate of increase of population growth since about 1960.  This confirms the UN studies I linked to before, as it is fairy evident that this growth rate will continue on its trend (we have no reason to believe it won't).\n\n&gt;Why are drug smugglers not shot in the face when caught at the boarder?\n\nWhat about our sense of morality?  I would, personally, find it absolutely abhorrent to shoot somebody *without a trial* and for a victimless crime.  What about their rights?  They could have a family who needs them, be in a terrible place at the time, or be forced against their will to do this.  You can't know their situation so your solution to simply shoot them and get it over with it is a terrifying prospect.\n\n&gt;Why are people allowed to make a baby at their own discretion?\n\nWell why shouldn't they be?  You never say *why* you believe these things, so I'll just voice my own opinion here and hope it resonates.  I believe that child-rearing is a fundamental human right.  A world without that right would seem ideal at first glance, a genetically \"superior\" humanity.  Once you look into the actuality of the matter, it is far less tempting.  First off, who decides whether or not someone can have children and for what reason?  This is a hugely important issue that you don't even begin to go into.  Next off, there is the issue of genetic diversity.  By selecting some people to breed, this would leave humanity susceptible to viruses that were not accounted for.  Next come the moral objections.  First off, you are dehumanizing the people you view as not supposed to have children.  You ignore how terrible it must be for them to be arbitrarily viewed as sub-par and therefore unfit to achieve what may be one of their life goals.  You also forget that in this dystopia, your parents may not have created you nor could you have children (if you desire).  You seem to forget that implementing a eugenics program like this has real effects on real people.  Those you hold dear may never have existed, or never be able to have the children they may want to.  You are suggesting the destruction of the lives of many.\n\n&gt;Why have we allowed people to voice their opinions when they are offended by something trival?\n\nTrivial according to whom?  Also, I'm sure there's something that you're offended by that someone else finds trivial.  Should you, therefore, not be allowed to ever voice that opinion?\n\n&gt;Why did ot take a fucking arms race to put us on the moon?\n\nWell we only had heavier than air flight for a short amount of time before the moon landings.\n\n&gt;Do we not remember what happened to the library of Alexandria?\n\nI'm no historian, but the extent of loss due to the destruction of the Library of Alexandria has been asked before, so I'll leave some links.\n\nhttp://www.quora.com/How-has-the-burning-of-the-Library-of-Alexandria-affected-the-world-and-where-would-we-be-if-it-never-happened/answer/Tim-ONeill-1\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14h7qx/how_far_did_the_destruction_of_the_library_at/c7d1l3y\n\n&gt;People and this world should have been organized strictly logically.\n\nOnce again, I must ask why?  Why is logic the most important thing?  Why not emotion or creativity?\n\n&gt;High IQ's should be paired\n\nIQ is a terrible measurement tool.  It seeks to quantify intelligence, which is absurd.  See the link [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Criticism_and_views).\n\n&gt;We have allowed ourselves to dilute our population to a bunch of whining bitches who can't fend for themselves.\n\nWith all due respect, what makes you better than those \"whining bitches\"?  Also, can you fend for yourself?  Can you produce food?  Clothes?  Electronics?  Shelter?  Water collection devices?  Sanitation devices?\n\n&gt;I know I'll be unpopular for this one. I do believe lesser crimes deserve a jail time but only lesser crimes should be dealt like that. If I catch you raping someone sorry dead. Murder - dead. Ten pounds of dope in your car crossing the boarder, can't go far after we put a bullet in your head. You know the big ass drug guy in mexico that had his compound and hippos? How did he over gun the police. One carpet bomb and no more problem. This tip toe bullshit is just that.\n\nBut how do we know that the people in your examples are guilty?  The fact is that the legal system is flawed, and innocent people can be convicted.  If we kill them, there is no reversal.  Furthermore, you should not be so blas\u00e9 about people's lives.  They are still people, do not dehumanize them.  Furthermore, shouldn't we try to rehabilitate criminals as well as punish them?\n\n&gt;Are some of the stupid reasons to cause a fuss. \n\nOnce again, they are stupid to you.  I'm sure that there are things you fuss about that others find stupid.  Should you be put down for these opinions?  Shouldn't you be allowed to voice them?\n\n&gt;Your son should be learning in school, not distracting with moronic rituals.\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"moronic\" rituals?\n\n&gt;We literally praise the people fucking up our world.\n\nYou simply left this here without any explanantion.  In what way are we praising those who \"fuck up\" our world?  Keep in mind that your version of \"fucking up\" is not everyone else's.\n\n&gt;If we continue to keep knowledge to the selected few then we will repeat the same mistake again.\n\nAre we doing that though?  A vast amount of knowledge is free and online.  There are plenty of libraries (at least in the developed world).  Education is free for many in the developed world, as is community college.\n\n&gt;What would happen if we lost the internet aka our brains?\n\nUh, I have no idea what this means.  Could you clarify?\n\n&gt;How many would be world class brain surgeons couldn't afford med school?\n\nThis is definitely true.  Medical school is expensive, but put yourself in the shoes of the administrators of the school.  Giving students a quality education is very expensive.  You could increase the cost of education or cut back the quality of education.  I think the former is the lesser of the two evils.\n\n&gt;We see this vase area when we look up and people have been studying the heavens for a long time. Why did it take a pissing match between the USA and Russia(Also its not \"America\" America includes both continents) to get to the moon? No one had the Idea to branch out? Isn't that what happened to the \"new world\"? We fucking branched out and explored.\n\nOnce again, we lacked the technology to explore the moon for a very long time.  The Wright brother s completed their famous journey about 60 years before the moon landing.  I'd consider 60 years to be an absurdly quick amount of time to go from barely lifting off to ground to launching a manned ship to the moon.  That's not even a full human lifetime.\n\n&gt;People need someone telling them no, telling them to shut up and not allowing scum to survive.\n\nOnce again, who determines who is \"scum\" and scum relative to whom?\n\nYour post seems to be based off the idea that some people are simply better than others.  The problem with this is that people are too multifaceted to apply a value to and sort.  By attempting to do this, you dehumanize all.  This seems to be the main problem, you forget that the people whose lives you proclaim should be ruined are still people, and you are no better than them.  The very premise of your post, frankly, strikes me as absurd.  How can we truly live life without freewill?  Without the freedoms to be angry and to be dumb, neither you nor I could truly be ourselves.  You suggest that we become automatons to create a new generation, but how can you ignore that we only get this one life?  So why should we waste it by not having freewill?  i'd rather not waste the life I was given to serve some next generation who will be stuck in the same situation as me.  I'd rather live my life to the fullest (without hurting others, which includes the future generations).  Also, you frequently mention scientific advancement, but how could we have science without freewill?  We need the ability to think to advance ourselves.  I'll, therefore, leave you with a quote from Chapter 9 of George Orwell's *1984*, \"The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc\"."}, {"id": "2o7c5y", "body": "Ill try not to make this a shotgun post of information and opinions. \n\nWe as a planet have failed, plain and simple.

At this point, the argument is over whose definition is better.\n\nAgain, your definition ignores the internal experience of exerting sovereign control in favor of an objective outsider's perspective.  I know you say this is an \"illusion,\" but why is it an illusion?  Because our subjective inner experience doesn't align well with the objective outer world?  In that case, let's define both the subjective experience and the objective world and see if they align poorly.\n\nThe objective world you posit (if I may) is one in which our decisions are influenced by factors we cannot change and are consciously unaware of, thus undermining the \"freedom\" of those decisions.\n\nThe subjective experience I posit is threefold:\n\n1. The personal experience of being the agent of my choices.  The qualia of me being a vehicle for changing the status quo, of being the but-for cause of changes I see in the world.\n\n2. The experience in (1) wherein my actions are uninfluenced by external factors that would cause me to initiate changes I do not desire.\n\n3. The belief that my choices are a result of conscious, rational deliberation.  This part of the experience, I concede, is an \"illusion\" insofar as it ignores subconscious influences.  It is also a poor predictive model for analyzing human decision-making.\n\nI believe (1) and (2) are compatible with your objective universe and not \"illusions.\"  Therefore, I believe your definition of control fails to account for important personal experiences that are not in tension with the universe you posit.\n\nThat's my first point.  I also want to argue a semantic point.  \"Freedom\" should only mean \"the ability to do what is possible to do but for some restriction.\"  You may say you are less \"free\" because you cannot fly, but this is a very different kind of limitation than when you are unable to do that which you are *actually capable of doing but for some external force stopping you*.  For example, not being able to fly is very different from being *able* to walk but someone holding your legs down.  The latter is more a limitation of your will than the former.  So too for our decision-making process.  I would not say that I am \"limited\" by my inability to make decisions that I would not make.  That seems to be the definition of free will you like, i.e., \"The ability to make decisions that are truly mine\" -- well what does that mean?  The ability to make a decision other than the one I actually made?  First, how does that make it \"mine\"?  Second, I can't conceive it (even *less* restricting than my inability to fly, which at least I can imagine).\n\nI'd finally like to attack this idea of an \"uninfluenced decision.\"  Uninfluenced things are impossible in this world.  They do not exist.  What would an \"uninfluenced\" decision look like?  It seems it would be completely random, nonsensical, and therefore not a result of a \"will\" at all.  That is to say, your definition of free will leads me down a path that seems to negate the will altogether."}, {"id": "2o79uk", "body": "(Im reposting this without the part calling you an asshole for judging people because 85% of people were ignoring the point and trying to convince me that its good to shame bad people)\n\n\nThis is best explained by this\n\n\n&gt;Everything you perceive is as a direct result of external stimuli. So even your innermost thoughts have an outward cause, and that cause is ultimately out of your control. Even something as simple as \"do I eat the chocolate now, or wait until after dinner?\" will be decided by a million other factors, such as subtle gene influences, the way your personality has been shaped over the years, your metabolism, the time of day, the weather, maybe some \"fat joke\" comments someone made about you, etc.\n\n\nIf there are so many things influencing my decision, especially things I truly have no control over like my genes, how can I possibly have free will in any real sense? I'm just being buffeted around by the winds of chance.\n\n\nI can think about my choices and then choose, but this is basically a delusion because the reality of the situation is that my entire personality, what defines me and the choices I make, is determined by genetics and environmental influences.\n\nEdit: a hypothetical example of how free will can exist in a casual universe will change my view\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

People say *all the time* that they want to listen to a song but wouldn't buy it, and when people can get it for free that may be true, but if that free access didn't exist *more people would pay for it.*  If the price is too high, then something like youtube or ad-supported streaming could pay for access.  Piracy eliminates the incentives for the creation of those venues."}, {"id": "cmlc9c8", "body": "&gt;Then find a way to borrow it or **don't use the product.**\n\nBut why? Who is actually hurt by my using it? This is under the assumption that I would never get the product due to it's price or other reasons.\n\n&gt;This is a great example for a couple reasons. First of all Adobe has offered free trials of their products, so if you just want to try it, you can. Secondly, because of demand from casual users Adobe has released cheaper, less powerful versions of many of their products. Those wouldn't exist if everyone just pirated the full version.\n\nFair enough, Photoshop was a bad example. There are many other programs that certainly aren't as \"demo friendly\" as Photoshop. But let's try a videogame that's landlocked in a country. For example, there are many games that are made in America that can't be sold in more restrictive countries due to the game's content. These people literally *have* to torrent a game in order to play it. \n\n&gt;I don't know what you mean by \"like that.\" I certainly realize that borrowing a friends laptop or using a library computer isn't as convenient as having your own copy, but it is definitely possible and people borrow media frequently. Netflix is the obvious commercial result of people wanting to borrow movies without purchasing them, but most libraries I've been to will lend you movies for free.\n\nI mean, barring the fact that a library computer is going to have, like, zero of the media pre-installed that you probably want (in most cases), \"borrowing a friend's laptop\" is almost never an option for a lot of people (this is also assuming that your friends have the content you want. If they don't, which is more than possible, this option gets thrown out the door). Being able to \"borrow content\" really only applies to physical media storage (i.e. DVDs, CDs, etc). In really niche situations, one of your available friends *might* have the exact program you need close by on their laptop for the desired amount of time you need to use it...but that's a huge *might*. \n\n&gt;Well, then too bad. This CMV is about whether or not piracy is good for publishers, not whether piracy makes your life more convenient. If you write a letter to a publisher explaining you like their product but can't afford it, there is a chance that will influence the price of the product. If you pirate it, it reduces the chance of companies investing in making that type of product--and the point of copyright (according to the constitution) is to incentivize creation to further progress in the arts and sciences.\n\nNo. Not too bad. You're bringing up ways you could get the software *assuming you are unable to buy it for other reasons*. I showed you this isn't a very good option. Now, if you say contacted the developer, asked, then after they inevitably said \"No\" you torrented it, that's not an awful option. Also, pirating in ***THIS HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION*** would not reduce the chance of companies investing in this type of product. It would have a NULL effect on that, especially if you didn't seed. \n\nNormally I would agree with you. Torrent is an overall bad thing for publishers. But, in the situation where you are landlocked OR you wouldn't consciously spend it on the product regardless, torrenting would not have a negative impact on publishers.\n"}, {"id": "cmlg17c", "body": "Who is hurt?

The question we are discussing is: *should* they pay for copying? \n\n&gt;It's illegal for the same reason stealing a car is illegal.\n\nNo, it's not. I explained that to you already. If I steal a car, the previous owner has one less car. If I copy the car, we both have a car. Crucial difference, and if you didn't notice, no filesharing proponent has ever argued that taking cars should be legal.\n\n&gt;Someone invested vast amounts of time and money into a product and it's their right to be able to get a return on that investment.\n\nAnd they still are able to, albeit by slightly different means then the traditional sale of individual permits. That model of production has been made obsolete by technological advancement. Why should we base our economic laws on production restrictions that no longer apply?\n\n&gt;No one is going to invest tens of millions of dollars into a product without compensation, even though the final item you receive is just a bunch of easily clonable 1s and 0s.\n\nThat's a good thing. Producers should work demand-based, not supply-based. Technological evolution has made it possible to get feedback from people and gauge the market before starting production, and we should rejoice that we can produce more efficiently now, not try to cling to the past.\n\n&gt;Are you really just that dense? Do you go around stealing gum even if you can afford that?\n\nNo, because if I take one gum somebody else has one less gum.\n\n&gt;Someone is investing time and money into a product and rather than allowing them to make a return on that investment\n\nThey still can make a return on investment, if their product is well-liked enough. People will crowdfund it beforehand, buy merchandise, donate or whatever other funding method they can come up with. If nobody cares enough about that product to make sure it gets money, it shouldn't exist.\n\n&gt;It's like if employers could just stop giving you a paycheck that you expected for your time investment.\n\nIf an employer can copy my work (for example, by programming a robot), then I don't think he should pay me copyright. Not even if I'm fired afterwards.\n\n&gt;And if you take a copy of something then it's a missed sale for the producer\n\nNo, it's not. That's just your assumption, but that can easily be disproved by taking for example a poor debt-ridden student who copied more files than his income would allow at all. And that's just someone who wouldn't be physically able to, plenty of people simply wouldn't buy it if they couldn't try out a copy first.\n\n&gt;Exactly. So by choosing to take something for free when you can afford it and should be paying for it is clearly screwing over the company.\n\nI don't see the problem. They aren't entitled to be in business, they have to convince people to fund them.\n\n&gt;The only reason that you're saying it's ok to pirate is because it's just easy to steal.\n\nFor the thirty-eleventh time, copying is not stealing.\n\n&gt;So what you're saying is that every blockbuster movie, AAA game, and best seller novel should be created and distributed in good faith knowing that they be lucky to get paid?\n\nNo. They can prefund, crowdfund, kickstart, get donations/venture capital, use subscriptions and use similar mechanisms.\n\n&gt;Do you receive your paycheck every week and think \"man I'm glad they decided to pay me this time around!\"?\n\nI would be surprised if I was paid for work that was done by machines, yes.\n\n&gt;Media is not information. It's entertainment.\n\nHumor and indecent entertainment is the first thing that is banned by would-be tyrants.\n\n&gt;Efficient use of resources also says that people won't do things without compensation.\n\nAnd yet, millions of aspiring artists make their work public without expecting compensation. Besides, stop misrepresenting my position, as you are wont to do: there are plenty of mechanisms that pre-fund creations available.\n\n&gt;Ownership might be an admin burden, but it's also an investment. People make things to make money. Sometimes those investments pay off with successful IP and other times they flop because they suck. That is how companies should prosper or fail, \n\nWhy should it be limited to that very specific arrangement?\n\n&gt;Curious, how do you feel about patents?\n\nResearch should be public. It would make it vastly easier to share ideas, and stimulate scientific progress.\n\n&gt;How would you feel if you worked for years on something, had a major breakthrough, and before you could go off and sell the idea someone breaks into your lab and steals all the data for themselves?

But it is still wrong - morally you can't condone it, even though you're a super cool guy and now people see you walking around with a sick Ralph Lauren belt and you're advertising for free.\n\nIf you pirate media, it affects the company that produced it almost not at all. If 25% of people do, they lose 25% of their income. If 100% do, then lose 100% of their income. I view it as identical to shoplifting."}, {"id": "cmkgqoh", "body": "&gt; If you pirate media, it affects the company that produced it almost not at all.

Shoplifting denies the original owner of the item ownership.\n\nEvery product or service has a one-time startup cost and a recurring per-unit cost. \n\nThe cost of a hand-carved wooden sculpture is almost entirely per-unit cost - the cost of the hand tools is a one time cost for the artist, but what you're really paying for is the labor and materials in the creation of a single piece.\n\nThere are things which are high one-time cost and high per-unit costs. For example, it costs a company many tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of research and development, testing, etc. to create a new car design, and then after that it costs quite a lot of money to source all the parts, lots of skilled labor and factory costs that go into creating each individual car and shipping it to whereever you live.\n\nThen on the far end of the scale, are things with very high one-time costs and very low per-unit cost. For example, it costs perhaps hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to research, design, and test a new drug, but once it's invented, it doesn't cost very much money to actually create each individual pill. Or a very cheap plastic toy car costs millions of dollars in factory tooling costs and then $0.01 of plastic to actually stamp out an individual car.\n\nIMO, the morality of stealing does not change depending on where the costs happen to lie - if they are all per-unit costs, half per-unit and half one-time, or all one-time. It's not right to steal a $200 sculpture, and it's not right to go into a store and steal a $200 pair of sunglasses, even if you leave $2 on the counter because you know it only took $2 to manufacture and distribute the sunglasses. Your moral choices are to either buy the sculpture or sunglasses, or to not buy it (and not steal it either).\n\nThese days, media is almost entirely one-time startup costs - it costs a movie production company hundreds of millions of dollars hiring skilled artists and workers, writers, cameramen, visual effects workers, actors, makeup artists, set dressers, lighting people, electricians, composers, recording experts, live orchestra, etc., etc., etc.. Once the movie is complete, the cost per unit is ~0. This is analogous to, say, a museum exhibit. The owners of the museum spend hundreds of millions of dollars building a building, finding works of art, building climate controlled boxes to hold priceless artifacts, setting up lighting, etc., etc., as well as hiring security, information workers, etc.. If 400 people are in the museum, the per-unit cost to the museum to give *you* individually the experience if you enter is also ~0 - they're already paying for the electricity, they've already paid the hundreds of millions of dollars for the art and the guides and the audio tours - it costs nothing to them for you to sneak in, just like it costs nothing to Warner Brothers for you to steal a copy of the Hobbit. Morally, they are equivalent, to me. Huge one-time startup cost, 0 per-unit cost, but nevertheless, they must recoup their costs, and you are not entitled take it for free, regardless of whether or not you believe it will be good advertising (you can tell all your friends about the awesome Picasso exhibit you snuck into and saw for free, too), or whether you *would* have paid for it had you had more money, or whether you are more likely to pay for the next museum exhibit next time - you still did a morally wrong thing. It's the same as shoplifting the sunglasses and leaving the cost of production and distribution on the counter.\n\nOther analogous things would be a live musical performance. They spent the money building the stage, setting up the speakers and mics and amps and lights. If the venue is not full already, the additional cost to the performers for you to attend is 0. It's all one-time cost, zero per-unit cost. Nevertheless, it is still wrong for you to sneak in without paying. They are providing you with an experience."}, {"id": "cmkgqoh", "body": "&gt; If you pirate media, it affects the company that produced it almost not at all.

Also, unlicensed use is not the same as stealing.\n\nEverybody else on Earth understands that if you use something without permission that is otherwise available once a fee is paid, that it's theft by definition. All you're doing is saying that since you can't afford it, the rules should be relaxed to make your theft less objectionable.\n\n&gt;Unlicensed use is not the same as stealing. And I disagree that if someone pirates something once, that proves that the person will never again pay for media.\n\nUnlicensed use is stealing. Period. You're only trying to convince yourself of the opposite. \nSecondly, it doesn't prove you'll never pay. It proves that you'll take something without paying for it if the opportunity is available and you don't think anybody is going to make a fuss about it. Since people upload games all the time, I have no doubt that you'll take a free one every time if given the choice.\n\n&gt;And... It was a good game? You should try it, buy it, try their other games? To change my view, you would have to prove that ignoring this game would be more economically beneficial than pirating it. Not just question the value of advertising.\n\nIt's not advertising when you take something you should be paying for. Stealing a bike is advertising according to your logic because it was such a good bike that other people should see you riding it.\n\n&gt;If the producer chooses to ignore the data, that isn't my problem. Not all products have identical pricing or distribution models.\n\nYou missed the point entirely. Your argument is ridiculous in the first place. The only thing the publisher could possibly learn from you is that you're a thief and it needs to find new ways to stop YOU from getting your hands on THEIR product. They could be selling the game for 25 cents and you'd STILL steal it if given the chance. So long as you have access to the internet there is no distribution problem. What are you, 12 ?\n\n&gt;This is a hypothetical situation in which one person is not purchasing a product, so the publisher wouldn't be making any money anyway. Again, unlicensed use is not stealing.\n\nRight...you're not purchasing a product, you're stealing it. Exactly. What do you think these guys are in business for ? Just for your entertainment pleasure ?\n\nYou can keep telling yourself that unlicensed use isn't stealing. That's exactly what it is but go ahead and play semantics for the rest of your life. The more you insist that it's not stealing (even though any 6 year old could see that it's the very definition of theft) the less people have any reason to respect your thought process on this matter."}, {"id": "cmlqfar", "body": "There you go again. You just can't accept the clear and obvious fact that you're stealing. That's the real problem here.\n\nYou're not supposed to be using without paying for it. End of story. The whole reason these companies make these games or any other software is so that somebody will pay to use it. Look at these semantics you toy with in an effort to convince yourself that you're not stealing. That's exactly what you're doing. The only people who are going to agree with you are other people who refuse to accept that they steal because then they might feel guilty about it. It's theft. Stealing.
