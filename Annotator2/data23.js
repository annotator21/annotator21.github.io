False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim Crow South, where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations.\n\nThis tradition continues today with cases like the University of Virginia and (this is what I believe, and not the subject of this post) Bill Cosby. \n\nA person making a legitimate accusation has nothing to fear, but people would think twice before wrongfully accusing others.\n\nI have predicted the generic responses to my argument and will respond to them here.\n\n**Rightful accusers would have something to fear, if the person who victimized them gets away with their crime, they will now face prosection**\n\nThis is a good point, but I think that this can be solved by rethinking the way we choose juries. Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process, regardless of the location of the trial, the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions. This makes it very difficult to convict criminal archetypes like the college rapist, or the malpracticing doctor. By introducing higher racial and socioeconomic diversity into juries, we can eliminate the predictability of verdicts.\n\n**The punishment is harsher than the crime.**\n\nNo it isn't. Killing someone is no different than setting a machine in motion that will result in them dying. Tricking the government into locking someone away for 40 years is surely a capital offense, and should be punished as such.\n\n**The perjury charge handles this**\n\nI believe that this is too weak, it is not a capital offense, and it should be.\n\nI am willing to change this view, but it will take some level of convincing. I am eager to hear the responses.  \n\nMODIFICATION OF MY VIEW credit to /u/AMereRedditor:\n\nI now believe that the minimum sentence for the crime that the accuser was accused of is inappropriate, but that the maximum sentence for the attempted version of the same crime is still very much appropriate. (If you are found guilty of knowingly, wrongfully accusing someone of murder, your sentence should be the maximum for attempted murder)\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

He doesn't dwell on those deaths because it would be detrimental to his mission, make him lose focus on his objective.

Some of them are smart and cunning. You can't just sweep all this aside and say Bond movies only ever have stupid bimbos.\n\nBut not everyone in a movie can be a major character. Some people are in supporting roles, and this is okay even if some of them happen to be women. You can't demand all women be important story-wise, it's an unrealistic expectation.\n\nConsidering how the Bond franchise has both kinds of women, if you say the strong female characters are okay but the sexy brunettes aren't, you are implicitly saying that **every** female character in the movie must be strong and empowered. This again is an unrealistic expectation. If you're not a radical ideologue you must accept that *movies should be able to have diverse characters which include women who are weak, dumb, sexy*, etc.\n\nNow, if we accept that not *every* female character has to be important and empowered, feminist critics can only find fault in the Bond franchise with big bosomed bikini babes. This is why I say lots of people confuse 'sexism' with 'sexy' - they believe that employing actresses who are visually pleasing to the average fellow is a \"sin\" in and of itself. This has nothing to do with stereotypes, sexism or discrimination, it's people being puritans and showing their anti-male biases. ([See the page 3 shitstorm for an other example of the same thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Page_3).) There is nothing inherently wrong with eye-candy characters.\n\nI will address your comment point-by-point soon :)"}, {"id": "cmviigo", "body": "Remember when I talked about not putting words in my mouth?  I never said anything about \"strong female characters\" nor did I ever say \"Bond movies only ever have stupid bimbos.\n\n&gt;M and Moneypenny are \"strong female characters\"\n\nM is a \"strong female character\" *when she's a woman,* which is only 1995-2012.  I'm not claiming that every single female character is bad, just that, over 25 films and half a century, I can count the good female characters on one hand. As for Moneypenny, do you seriously want to discuss whether a secretary is a good female role model?\n\n&gt;some Bond-girls are the accomplices of the main villain, trying to murder or distract Bond, so they aren't just eye candy either.\n\nOkay, so instead of just being there for Bond to have sex with, they're there for him to... not be killed by and then have sex with?  That's not much different.\n\n&gt;But not everyone in a movie can be a major character. Some people are in supporting roles, and this is okay even if some of them happen to be women.\n\nSure.  Again, my complaint *isn't* that women shouldn't be supporting characters.  It's that women are *exclusively* supporting characters.  Practically every major character, minus maybe two or three, is male.\n\n&gt;You can't demand all women be important story-wise\n\nStop trying to set up this straw man.  I have repeatedly said that I am not demanding this.\n\n&gt;Considering how the Bond franchise has both kinds of women\n\nI contest this (again except for two or three).\n\n&gt;if you say the strong female characters are okay but the sexy brunettes aren't\n\nOnce again, the problem isn't the existence of sexy brunettes, it's that that's all there are (okay, there are sexy blondes, too).\n\n&gt;you are implicitly saying that every female character in the movie must be strong and empowered.\n\nNope again.\n\n&gt;feminist critics can only find fault in the Bond franchise with big bosomed bikini babes. This is why I say lots of people confuse 'sexism' with 'sexy' - they believe that employing actresses who are visually pleasing to the average fellow is a \"sin\" in and of itself.\n\nOnce again, this isn't the problem.  The problem is when the franchise depicts a world where a woman's only role is in service to a man.  I'd like you to point out two examples, other than 1995-2012 M, of a woman who fits this description.\n\n\n&gt;There is nothing inherently wrong with eye-candy characters.\n\nI have nothing against eye-candy if there is also non-eye candy.\n\nAs for your links, the \"page 3 controversy\" isn't really relevant (again, I have nothing against eye-candy).  As for your first link, the central premise is flawed.  It draws a distinction between \"strong masculine characters,\" which is described:\n\n&gt;Masculine in general means direct in speech, confident in action, coolheaded in combat, lethal in war, honorable in tourney or melee, cunning in wit, unerring in deduction, glib in speech, and confident and bold in all things.\n\nWhereas \"strong feminine characters\" entail:\n\n&gt;Feminine in general means being more delicate in speech, either when delivering a coy insult or when buoying up drooping spirits. Femininity requires not the sudden and angry bravery of war and combat, but the slow and loving and patient bravery of rearing children and dealing with childish menfolk: female fortitude is a tenacity that does not yield even after repeated disappointments and defeats.\n\nJust look at the adjectives being used here.  Men are \"direct,\" \"confident,\" \"coolheaded,\" \"honorable,\" \"cunning,\" \"unerring,\" and \"bold.\"  Women are \"delicate,\" \"coy,\" \"slow,\" \"loving,\" and \"patient.\"  It also does not involve \"sudden... bravery,\" but rather \"rearing children.\"  If this isn't an inherently sexist premise, I don't know what is.\n\nAre you, with a straight face, telling me that you believe the following statements are not *blatantly* sexist?\n\n&gt;Masculine nature tends to be adversarial and domineering where the feminine tends to be yielding and conciliatory\n\n&gt;The feminine way to correct the problem is to get someone else in the group to volunteer out of kindness. It is not duty oriented. The masculine way to correct the problem is to endure it, fix it yourself on your own time, or command an underling to correct it if and only if that falls within the scope of his duty\n\n&gt;Girls who do not like love stories are well advised to learn to like them, because such stories deal with the essential and paramount realities on which much or most of that girl\u2019s happiness in life will hinge.\""}, {"id": "cmul6ej", "body": "&gt;Not everything is a statement about gender equality. Not every movie has to be about spreading feminist values, and ones which do not spread feminist values are not \"anti-gender equality\", they are just stories about other stuff.\n\nAre you okay with movies being racist so long as they're not \"about spreading pro-racial equality values\"?  So, so long as I'm not making a movie that's about civil rights for racial minorities, it's perfectly acceptable for me to throw in a bunch of Latino gardeners being super lazy while watching a blackface minstrel show?  Perpetuating stereotypes is bad, even if that's not the express purpose.\n\n&gt;For example the Bond movies are not educational videos about gender inequality, they are action flicks created for the entertainment of people who like action flicks.\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt;The idea that feminist theory should be injected into every possible medium is really, really sick.\n\nIt's not about \"injecting feminist theory.\"  It's about *not* perpetuating negative stereotypes.\n\n&gt;On a more practical level, there is no win with you guys. If the villain is a female, you immediately attack because the movie \"portrays women negatively\" and probably shows violence against women\n\nI don't know who \"you guys\" is, and I would prefer it if you didn't lump me with people whose position I don't necessarily share.  I would be absolutely fine with a female villain: that's a woman in a role where she actually has as deep and interesting character \"presumably.\"  \"Portraying women negatively\" is portraying them in a way that affirms society's negative stereotypes.  It has nothing to do with their character being a good guy or a bad guy.\n\n&gt;If the protagonist is a woman she must not be sexy in any way, because that's \"sexism\"\n\nUm, no?  I don't hold this position at all.  Please don't put words in my mouth.  Being sexist has absolutely nothing to do with the attractiveness of female characters.\n\n&gt;If a movie shows women only as sex symbols, why is that a problem?\n\nAgain, it's because it perpetuates the stereotype that women are *only* sex symbols.\n\n&gt;Some people won't like it, sure, but that just means those people are not the target audience.\n\nOf course.  Just like black people won't like my minstrel show movie, but that's okay because wealthy white people are my target audience.\n\n&gt;Is it forbidden to target movies at non-feminist audiences now?\n\nThere's a huge difference between targeting people who aren't feminists and actively acting contrary to gender equality.\n\n&gt;What is the problem with some movies catering to male tastes?\n\nNothing.  I'm a man, and I enjoy watching movies with sexy women in them.  I just want those women to *do* something other than basically being eye candy.  There are plenty of attractive male actors, but you rarely, if ever, see them in movies where their only role is to be attractive on screen.\n\n&gt; I don't see why I should accept an ideology that basically says my tastes are politically incorrect per se just because I was born with the wrong genitalia. My tastes are just as valid as any feminist's, and if film studios decide they want to make a movie that caters to me, all the offended feminists can go fuck themselves.\n\nIt has absolutely nothing to do with taste.  Well, unless you count being pro-stereotyping a taste.  For example: say I'm a neo-Nazi.  I really like watching movies that tell me how the Jews are slowly destroying our country.  Why are all the pro-Jew tastes out there more valid than mine?  If film studios want to make a movie about how awful the Jews are, all the offended people out there can go fuck themselves.\n\n&gt;So you're basically saying that all movies should contain grrrl power feminist idols, and that's the only role women should ever play in movies. Holy fucking dystopia, Batman.\n\nI'm not saying that.  At all.  Again, please don't put words in my mouth.  What I am saying is that they shouldn't *only* play roles where they serve no purpose other than to essentially be attractive and have sex with men.  So long as there's an equal distribution in agency between men and women, there's no reason why *every* female character needs to be a \"feminist idol\" (whatever you mean by that)."}, {"id": "cmvefds", "body": "&gt; Are you okay with movies being racist so long as they're not \"about spreading pro-racial equality values\"? \n\nFirst of all, Bond movies are not sexist the way you think about racism. Bond does not hate or denigrate women, in fact he loves them and puts himself in danger many times for their sake. Let's reverse this comparison of yours: would it be okay to portray black guys as sexy? Because that was the Bond movies' \"sin\", showing sexy women.\n\nAnd to be honest I would have no problem with movies showing racism because I can differentiate between fiction and reality, and also between entertainment and educational material. I never follow bad examples from movies - I don't kill, I don't rape, and I don't become a sexist/racist just by seeing the signs of sexism/racism in a movie. I don't see the need for a puritanical witch hunt to purge all references to, or depictions of politically incorrect material in entertainment.\n\n&gt; Perpetuating stereotypes is bad, even if that's not the express purpose.\n\nPeople can distinguish fiction from reality, movies playing on stereotypes do not harm anybody. You should calm down a bit, the fate of the world does not hang in the balance here.\n\n&gt;  It's not about \"injecting feminist theory.\" It's about not perpetuating negative stereotypes.\n\nThe very idea that showing dumb or sexy women in a movie is a \"negative stereotype\" which harms real life women in general **is a part of feminist theory**, which was never proven, or even meaningfully studied. It's a baseless assumption coming from a controversial ideological group (ie. feminism).\n\nIt was proven numerous times that violence in entertainment does not cause real-life violence, so it's only natural to assume that the same is true for sexism.

If showing sexy women is not a problem, then what is? Some women in the Bond franchise are smart, capable, driven. Others aren't. **Just like in real life**.\n\n&gt; Again, it's because it perpetuates the stereotype that women are only sex symbols.\n\nThat could only ever be true if you could only see exactly 1 movie ever, but that 1 was pushed on you regardless of you wanting to see it or not. But immediately after *voluntarily* seeing a Bond film you can watch the girl with the dragon tattoo or whatever. People understand perfectly well that Bond-girls are supposed to be eye-candy, which says nothing about their real-life acquaintances.\n\n&gt; Just like black people won't like my minstrel show movie, but that's okay because wealthy white people are my target audience.\n\nSee my first point above.

There is nothing unequal in diversity. Some stories show [feminists killing an innocent man and dancing marrily over his corpse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tQSOlF9ZZM), other stories show a spy seducing attractive women to extract information out of them.

You might want to change it so everyone becomes the same, but it won't work since we are not the same.

I was merely comparing two positions that both come from an assumption of inequality.\n\n&gt;Arguing that eye candy is not inherently bad is in no way comparable to advocating for killing jews.\n\nI agree with you that eye candy is not inherently bad (as I've said a thousand times, but you continue to ignore it).  I was in no way suggesting that you advocate killing Jews, and saying that I was implying that merely deflects my argument without responding to it.\n\n&gt;don't try to ruin their fun by lecturing them about how they should like what you like and dislike what you dislike because ideological reasons.\n\nI'm not trying to change what you like.  I'm arguing that the movies present a sexist and stereotyped viewpoint (as per the initial CMV).  If you choose to like that, fine.\n\n&gt;M isn't attractive and never f_cks anyone in the movies :) Your wish is granted, the Bond movies are not sexist\n\nOne character.  Who existed for maybe a quarter of the franchise.  That's one character in your argument out of 25 films in 50 years."}, {"id": "cmvo8ce", "body": "I could yet again address all your points but it seems futile since you keep building your argument on flawed premises.\n\nStereotypes in movies do not harm people in real life. You keep repeating that they do, but this is just a feminist/progressive/SJW statement not supported by any study, data or observation. People consume unholy amounts of violent/pornographic material nowadays and violence/rape is at a 30 year low. If anything, the conclusion here is that by *virtually* experiencing these things through movies and games people live out their suppressed fears/desires and it helps them be more rational in their real life. No matter how deeply you believe that stereotypes hurt women it just isn't so. Even kids know perfectly well that movies are not real. (Well, maybe kindergarteners don't but fuck you if you let your 5 yo kid watch movies where people kill each other. Then again, 'sexism' would be the least of your problems in that case.)\n\nA movie can't be \"sexist by omission\", ie. by lacking relevant female characters. An entire movie can be about a boy and his dog, and it's not sexist for a lack of interesting female characters. An endless number of movies can be created that absolutely do not need major female characters and none of them would be sexist. And this includes the Bond franchise as well. It does not need feminist-friendly characters and the lack of them do not make it sexist. If you have 90 minutes for a movie about a spy adventure and your first thought is how to put a feminist-friendly female character in there, your priorities are fucked.\n\nI get it that you like movies that contain certain types of characters, but where on earth did you get the idea that if a movie is not to your liking then it's *objectively* bad? Your notions about 'equality' are not objective standards everything should measure up to, it's just your own utopistic idea about gender/race relations. Why should movies reflect your utopia, or that of feminists? What makes your ideology **the** ideology that should govern the whole of human existence?\n\nThose who create art and entertainment are autonomous human beings who should not be controlled by outsiders with an ideological axe to grind. Sadly feminism already has an unprecedented negative influence on movies and gaming, and it tries to transform everything to its own image. By adding unnecessary (even distracting) strong female characters to a story that does not need them you transform that story into feminist propaganda - this is obviously the main goal here, to transform everything into vehicles for delivering the feminist message.\n\nAnd to re-address the main point, the Bond franchise simply tells a story where \"empowered\" women are not needed from a story-telling standpoint. They could shove in some for ideological reasons but that would lower the quality of the product. In fact the latest version of Moneypenny is just that: an unnecessary grrrl power character who keeps competing with Bond in every f_cking thing they do and it's annoying as hell because a *\"my dick is bigger than yours\"* argument is always awkward between a man and a woman. It's even more embarrassing between the most prestigious secret agent in the world and a young rookie at the agency. I know, I know, [women can do everything a man can do, and do it better, in heels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXOpid-VHh0), but must I suffer this misandrist political bullshit even in a Bond movie for crying out loud?! /rant"}, {"id": "cmsnykk", "body": "You don't seem to understand the femi-centric zeitgeist.

I own all of the movies(even Moonraker!  I actually paid to own Moonraker!

With that said: James Bond is undeniably sexist.\n\nThe franchise has been getting better about this as time has gone on, but it's still there in the new ones and its is there to an absurd degree in the old ones.  One of the classic examples is the \"man talk\" exchange from Goldfinger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcNGYRKBfHA.  It's a small moment, but it's pretty representative of the early movies.  Most women Bond interacts with are either incompetents or evil seductresses.  As time has gone on we've gotten more and more women who know what they're doing to some degree, but women in the movies are still far more likely than men to be idiots(who either learn the way the world works after sleeping with Bond, or die to give Bond motivation, or both) or untrustworthy seductresses(who Bond either kills or bangs into virtue).

Or sleep with him, then try to kill him. \n\nWhat other interaction would you have them have with him? They can either be co-workers, enemies or background characters. Co-workers he doesn't get involved with (not Dench's M, nor any Moneypenny). Enemies he may get involved with or not, and if the background character is important enough, how else would you involve her with Bond's story? Bond can't have any other relationship that isn't fleeting, since he's Britain's super-spy.\n\n&gt; As for the second point, he's not a real person. He's a fictional character. He can act or react in any way that serves the story. The story doesn't need him to sleep with every woman who crosses his path. The story doesn't need him to move on from their death in 30 seconds. The writers choose to make it happen this way and they choose to make it happen over and over again, often several times within the same movie.\n\nYou know that this is based on a series of novels written by a man who actually served in His Majesty's Secret Service, right? \n\nAlso, why would they choose to go the unreal way?"}, {"id": "cmt6v9y", "body": "&gt; What other interaction would you have them have with him?\n\nWow.

While I haven't seen them all (mostly the Daniel Craig and Pierce Brosnan ones), criticism exists for all movies in this regard. \n\n[Taking it from this article](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/james-bond-spectre-empire/), it seems their problem is the objectifiction of Bond's one night stands on the basis that he just sleeps with them and then forgets about them. But I don't see how that can be.considered objectification, since both parties agree to have consensual sex and Bond never makes any hints on wanting to build a relationship. Just letting things happen. He does use the woman for sexual gratification, but so does the woman with him. There's no way one doesn't \"use\" someone as something if this is what they mean.\n\nAnother point is that he is cold and uncaring towards his ONS getting killed, but it seems this could be explained more succinctly through Bond's job: he's a spy, a trained soldier who is put in danger's way all the time to defend his country and that through the years he has become numb to death. He doesn't dwell on those deaths because it would be detrimental to his mission, make him lose focus on his objective. This is probably something he has trained for.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

So how is it different ? We're really talking about degrees of personal responsibility here. \n\nPeople learn about personal responsibility as they get older and wiser. A 4 year old has no real ability to conceptualize the repercussions of a gambling problem. In fact, since they don't even earn their own money, they have no idea whatsoever of its value.\n\nLikewise, a 16 year old is far more mature but is he or she mature enough to really understand or even recognize a gambling problem ? Listening to the average teenager talk, what are they most concerned with ? I have yet to hear any teenager complain about not being able to afford a gas or electricity bill, never mind a mortgage. \n\nThe average teenager has still not had to work for their money. They get an allowance (perhaps) or have a part time job. However, in the vast majority of cases, all money earned is spent at their discretion. None has to be budgeted toward life's basic necessities. They can afford to blow all their money on scratch tickets or a night in the casino (were it legal for them to do so) and not have to worry about having blown their paycheck despite rent being due. \n\nAllowing them to gamble away their money at such an immature time in their lives only opens the door to some of them developing a gambling problem. They won't stop being irresponsible with their money on their 18th birthday. That's why we don't let them gamble now.

Supply is the only thing restricted by those qualifications. If an object is not being sold, then the copy has no market value and thus the only value is it's utility to the owner making the supply restriction moot.\n\nI agree that if an object (movie, show, game, music) is not being sold, then people copying it in order to make it available on the market is not obviously wrong. \n\nYou do say that an object not being sold is only worth it's utility to the owner. It's not totally clear if you mean the copier or the copyright holder (or creator if you'd rather use that term), but I don't that matters too much for my point. I think that the object will have the *same* market value as if it were being sold. This value is demonstrated through the efforts people put in in order to make it available to others. As you stated elsewhere, there is an associated opportunity cost, which is what people are effectively \"paying\" for the product. I agree that this value is probably a lot lower than what everyone would be required to pay for a \"legal copy\" (either an out-of-print version or some other re-sold version), but I think the object has more value than just \"utility to the owner.\"\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The counterfeit owner would have bought it should he not have access to his artist friend.

The problem is of course determining if he has done harm and in the absence of proof its hard to convict someone. It's not that there is no harm done, its that there is no good objective way to bring evidence against them so without solving that problem discussing what damages they owe is moot.\n\nSo my argument here is my main point, I suppose. You are arguing that the act of making copies itself is not a crime, or that the crime cannot be clearly put into categories of \"stealing $$ from the creator\" and \"not stealing $$ from the creator.\" It's clear that almost every instance of copying and distributing *does* take money from the creator. As we've talked about before in this thread, the value of a product is based on supply and demand. A creator has some ability to control the supply, in that they release a certain number of copies. (In the case of digital downloads, they don't have a download cap necessarily, but they can still effectively restrict supply by assigning a price to their product. They can also only have the product online for a certain period of time.)\n\nA counterfeiter, or a person who hosts torrent files (if that's the right way to say that...), is changing the value of the product by creating/distributing more copies. This process devalues the product for the creator, because the supply is much higher (it's only restricted by opportunity cost and potential equipment costs, which both are in play to some degree with the legitimate copy of the product [driving the store, downloading the file, having the correct technology to enjoy the product]). The value of product because of this insane increase in supply (almost unlimited copies in the market) devalues the product. The creator has lost money, definitely, in this situation.\n\n&gt;So yes they are technically committing a crime, but it is a crime that is so arbitrarily enforced that it again breaks down to \"If X is thought to take Y revenue from party Z, this law gives us the justification to act on it\"\n\nI don't think that this statement justifies *not* trying to enforce the crime. Yes, some people do not face penalties, and some face huge penalties. The prosecuting parties *should* be held accountable for their actions, and for their attempts to equally apply the law. However, these laws (copyright laws specifically I suppose) are very hard to enforce the same way every time, due to the international nature of these crimes. I think that even though we cannot always deal with people the same way, we should attempt to punish those we *know* have done wrong. \n\nI haven't been totally clear about who I think is the wrongdoer. I think that the copier is the wrongdoer, certainly. As is the individual who seeds the torrent file. As are the people who download the file (especially, as you said, if they would have otherwise bought the product). But it seems to me that the people providing the access to these illegal markets are equally to blame. They make money off of these illegal transactions. They can claim that they don't know that illegal activity is happening on their servers, but that's just a plain lie. Normally when a service is hosting illegal files (or providing access to them), the copyright holder asks them to take the files down. TPB always refused to do this (as opposed to Google, for example). \n\nOverall this is an interesting discussion!

Now we have the internet.  True democracy hasn't been around since Athens--the last time all the people in a society was feasibly able to get together in a forum to vote.  But now it's possible.\n\nI think it would work just fine, and it would even mesh well with our current system.\n\nIt's very frustrating how our current parties align.

One thing that has been brought up, that affects the discussion pretty deeply is the distinction between: \n\na)a system where every single vote has to be done through every single person.  \n\nb) a system where people can then vote on policies related to the system itself, and so could evolve.\n\nI was imagining (b) when I posted this, but there's a lot of discussion around (a) as well.\n\nEdit2.  Just to pre-empt a few of the common counter-arguments:\n\n-Most people are stupid\n\nOK, that's a common opinion, not one that I personally hold.  But even if people are stupid, we now have a science committee full of people who don't believe in evolution or climate change.  I would trust randomly selected people from the country over that.  It's been shown time and time again that crowdsourcing performs just fine.  \n\n-Voter Turnout\n\nPeople wouldn't be forced to vote on topics that don't apply to them or they don't understand.  In fact, they could just as well be encouraged not to.  I see it as a negative that I vote for Obama because I want public healthcare, but then I also have to go with his opinion on farm subsidies, when I don't know what that is, and I don't have time to research it.  In this system, I wouldn't have to.  \n\n-Hackers\n\nI think if the vast majority of the internet can run on open-source software, we can figure something out on this front.  There are security issues with our current methods, too, but we figured it out.\n\n\nEdit 3:\n\nOK people, we can throw it in.  Cmall2 C-ed my V.  It was pretty good.\nThe basic points were:\n\n-The dynamics of when a minority would get totally screwed would be very hard to predict.\n\n-The whole system would potentially be very volatile.  Some things which should probably change slowly could change very quickly.\n\nWhile I still think a variation on such a system could be more effective, the statement I made is that this particular kind of system would be better than the one we have now, and now I don't know if that's true.  So it's no longer my view!\n\nThanks for the good times guys!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSz16ngdsG0\n\n\n\nEdit 4:  One last edit for posterity:  It's kind of funny all these people who are deathly afraid of people voting in their own interest, yet believe firmly in the invisible hand.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I have to admit, a major reason my view changed is because of things like this.  White people don't have muslim or black friends, and thus could oppress unchecked out of ignorance.  The extent to which people can delude themselves scares me a bit.  But I think most people just don't care rather than specifically feeling like they need to go out of their way to oppress.

Now we have the internet.  True democracy hasn't been around since Athens--the last time all the people in a society was feasibly able to get together in a forum to vote.  But now it's possible.\n\nI think it would work just fine, and it would even mesh well with our current system.\n\nIt's very frustrating how our current parties align. It's like they're perfectly aligned to create maximum fighting between themselves, but in the end up being exactly the same on all the most important issues, like war, monetary policy, labor rights, and energy investment--where the policy of both is pretty much \"Fuck you.\"\n\nVoting on issues would make it so someone who is very religious could vote pro-life, but also pro-environmentalist.\n\nSomeone could vote for gay marriage, but also against gun control.  Right now, these things are essentially impossible in national elections.\n\nCMV\n\nOr go to /r/openparty/ and start working it out if you agree:\n\n\n\nEdit.  One thing that has been brought up, that affects the discussion pretty deeply is the distinction between: \n\na)a system where every single vote has to be done through every single person.  \n\nb) a system where people can then vote on policies related to the system itself, and so could evolve.\n\nI was imagining (b) when I posted this, but there's a lot of discussion around (a) as well.\n\nEdit2.  Just to pre-empt a few of the common counter-arguments:\n\n-Most people are stupid\n\nOK, that's a common opinion, not one that I personally hold.  But even if people are stupid, we now have a science committee full of people who don't believe in evolution or climate change.  I would trust randomly selected people from the country over that.  It's been shown time and time again that crowdsourcing performs just fine.  \n\n-Voter Turnout\n\nPeople wouldn't be forced to vote on topics that don't apply to them or they don't understand.  In fact, they could just as well be encouraged not to.  I see it as a negative that I vote for Obama because I want public healthcare, but then I also have to go with his opinion on farm subsidies, when I don't know what that is, and I don't have time to research it.  In this system, I wouldn't have to.  \n\n-Hackers\n\nI think if the vast majority of the internet can run on open-source software, we can figure something out on this front.  There are security issues with our current methods, too, but we figured it out.\n\n\nEdit 3:\n\nOK people, we can throw it in.  Cmall2 C-ed my V.  It was pretty good.\nThe basic points were:\n\n-The dynamics of when a minority would get totally screwed would be very hard to predict.\n\n-The whole system would potentially be very volatile.  Some things which should probably change slowly could change very quickly.\n\nWhile I still think a variation on such a system could be more effective, the statement I made is that this particular kind of system would be better than the one we have now, and now I don't know if that's true.  So it's no longer my view!\n\nThanks for the good times guys!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSz16ngdsG0\n\n\n\nEdit 4:  One last edit for posterity:  It's kind of funny all these people who are deathly afraid of people voting in their own interest, yet believe firmly in the invisible hand.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One thing that has been brought up, that affects the discussion pretty deeply is the distinction between: \n\na)a system where every single vote has to be done through every single person.  \n\nb) a system where people can then vote on policies related to the system itself, and so could evolve.\n\nI was imagining (b) when I posted this, but there's a lot of discussion around (a) as well.\n\nEdit2.  Just to pre-empt a few of the common counter-arguments:\n\n-Most people are stupid\n\nOK, that's a common opinion, not one that I personally hold.  But even if people are stupid, we now have a science committee full of people who don't believe in evolution or climate change.  I would trust randomly selected people from the country over that.  It's been shown time and time again that crowdsourcing performs just fine.  \n\n-Voter Turnout\n\nPeople wouldn't be forced to vote on topics that don't apply to them or they don't understand.  In fact, they could just as well be encouraged not to.  I see it as a negative that I vote for Obama because I want public healthcare, but then I also have to go with his opinion on farm subsidies, when I don't know what that is, and I don't have time to research it.  In this system, I wouldn't have to.  \n\n-Hackers\n\nI think if the vast majority of the internet can run on open-source software, we can figure something out on this front.  There are security issues with our current methods, too, but we figured it out.\n\n\nEdit 3:\n\nOK people, we can throw it in.  Cmall2 C-ed my V.  It was pretty good.\nThe basic points were:\n\n-The dynamics of when a minority would get totally screwed would be very hard to predict.\n\n-The whole system would potentially be very volatile.  Some things which should probably change slowly could change very quickly.\n\nWhile I still think a variation on such a system could be more effective, the statement I made is that this particular kind of system would be better than the one we have now, and now I don't know if that's true.

In reality, this is why I am not a federalist because I think we should have active, direct civic participation on a local level and leave the federal government to a more limited role that wouldn't require complex plebiscites boiled down to a national yes/no question. \n\nI mean, if we vote locally for our elected representative to protect net neutrality, they ought to go and do it. But we shouldn't wait for the federal government to make it a constitutional right, we should pass those laws in our towns, cities, counties and state. \n\nThis was basically the idea of how our democracy was supposed to work, the checks and balances, populism, etc. We need to re-think what it is we want our federal government to do for us. The system is so convoluted and complex that we absolutely need elected representatives to run this monster and direct democracy could not work.
