It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

Do we have exact percentages for any of these? No. Will we ever? No. But a 7th grader could understand that sexual assault/rape is a far greater issue than \"false rape accusations.\" \n\nWhat's more important to focus on is that 1 in 100 rapists will ever face a day in jail. What's more important to focus on is that 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted, some even say 1 in 4. To believe that women are lying about getting raped is, quite frankly, idiotic and downright misogynistic. Women are people. Victim-blaming is ingrained into the laws and systems of this society. Women are terrified of coming forward because of people who push the idea that women are liars by nature. You, my friend, are edging on the \"women are liars and shouldn't be trusted when they come forward about their rape/assault.\" \n\nThe issue here is not that our society believes women, but rather that society DOES NOT believe women. I have read countless stories about women who report their rape-- only to be charged themselves for trying to slander their partner's name. In 2012, 50 girls attending a nearby university came forward about their assaults--only to be EXPELLED. The boys, however, received no punishment or trial.\n\n I find that people who push shit like this also happen to push an anti-female agenda-- MRAs, RedPillers, manosphere types, etc. Be really careful with what you're saying."}, {"id": "2orak0", "body": "Edit 3: [u/grapeban](http://www.reddit.com/user/Grapeban) &amp;#8710; 'd me by providing [this 2005 study](http://paladinservice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gap-or-chasm-rape-report.pdf) from the London Metropolitan University by way of the British Home Office.

The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

This is a tricky problem, but welfare systems that minimize this effect (such as by avoiding means testing welfare programs) are better able to help people keep working while receiving some assistance.  If a welfare program can avoid disincentivizing work (avoid creating 'freeloaders' if we use your terminology) it works better to help people out of poverty and thereby does a better job reducing crime.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmq0kld", "body": "It gives the impression that your point is \"Argentina has welfare and crime, therefore welfare doesn't reduce crime\".  This shows little understanding of a) argentina and b) causes of crime.  \n\nIf you take the most developed countries in the world, thus filtering out many other factors, and look at the ones with less crime and poverty, you'll see many have solid welfare programs.  Call them freeloaders, call them basic rights beneficiaries, whatever.  \n\nMaintaining people out of poverty is not the same as communist totalitarianism where no one gets rewarded for hard work, there are points in between that *can* work.  doesn't mean it's simple or straightforward."}, {"id": "2or6j6", "body": "Edit: After your very interesting replies, I can refine my CMV as: Whenever more welfare is discussed, freeloading is a big argument against it.

People who are in poverty are much more likely to seek an escape through drugs which in the USA are illegal. In order to get these drugs you have to cross the line into illegal behaviour from the get go, so you are already in the eyes of the law a criminal. If you make drug use legal, not supply just use, then the power dynamic flips. All the users of drugs have power over the suppliers, able to turn them in at a moments notice. Thus you have no power being held over users by suppliers, so no way of forcing them to do things like commit crimes in a gang. \n\nNow make drug use a public health issue like in Portugal, and bam! Overnight you have a reduction of addicts. These people get the help they need and no longer have any need to break the law to get money for their next hit. Reduce poverty for a less direct mechanism. \n\nSo in the few percent of thugs who would become layabouts if the option were presented, sure, it would help.

But this seems unfair to those who just happen to have been born unlucky, that is, into families who do not have access to good schools and other preferences or who are not given opportunities because of disabilities, or racial, class, or gender discrimination\n\n* Allowing for the accumulation of wealth prevents some people from having the same opportunities as others.  This undermines the possibility that people will be able to engage fully in an informed democracy because they will not have equal access to information or will not be able to understand the information they receive.  In this way their freedom is limited\"\n\n&gt; This is getting to be a bit of a rabbit trail, but I'm establishing that the state expropriation of property through taxation is thievery and thuggery and your assertion that you would prefer freeloaders over thugs is absurd, because you are just trading one thug for another. \n\nWhen I said thug, I mean the common thug.

If you don't believe the other billion or so other citizens shouldn't get their equal share of the decision making and should do things your way all the time, maybe democracy isn't for you and you shouldn't lend it legitimacy by offering your two cents.\n\nObviously, children can't consent. Their parents and guardians have to do that for them.\n\nRe: slaves, obviously not. From a legal standpoint, slavery is illegal, and from a moral standpoint, you cannot own a human being. However, a human born into a group either gets his (strictly equal) say in group decisions, or he accepts the will of the group and shuts up. He doesn't always get his way because those decisions affect people around him. If he doesn't understand that, that's fine, but that means he believes in temper tantrums and not the process of democracy, and thinks his decisions should override the group decisions made by voting.\n\nThe cycle starts when people get together and form a government. They agree to poll consensus on group decisions via a process (in our case, the one outlined in the constitution and elaborated on in the greater body of law. You may not agree with every decision that gets made, but presumably you support this process for making them and agree to abide by the rules it makes.\n\nThe state creates rather a lot of shit, if you hadn't noticed - first among it being laws that its constituents have come to a consensus to live by. By the same logic that the state creates nothing, corporations produce nothing either. In both cases, the component members are the ones doing the work. The state also creates things like firehouses, police stations, public schools, jails (maybe too many of these), public libraries, financial services,, and roads. It's mostly services, but any reasonable person counts that.\n\nThere is nothing actually demanding that you obey the state if you feel you aren't being treated fairly. If a system is illegitimate, why should you (or anyone else) care what it thinks? You could find some like minded people and found your own government, with blackjack and hookers. But if you do that, you'll need to find somewhere to put it that doesn't take land or other resources from another government, or you'll have to convince enough other people to fight them and take what that government has by force.\n\nThe state killing natives was certainly unjust and lamentable, but the thing that gives them a claim over yours is that the state represents the collective decisions of the entire population, yours included. Withdraw your support, and it represents one less person. Get enough people to withdraw enough support and you can start a new state or cut down the existing one to a fraction of its original power.\n\nBeing rude doesn't change the logic, but it's shitty, ad hominem logic and a leading question. If I need to answer that question, you should have to answer this: Given your seeming confusion about questions of consent, why haven't you denied that you support sex with children?\n\n*Note: you do not have to answer that question because like the rape one that other guy asked me, its obvious, irrelevant, ad hominem, and disrespectful. Questions like that don't raise the quality of a debate.

Were someone, however, to proclaim that taxes are theft, and then use other people's \"stolen\" tax dollars in their neighborhood to pay for firemen, cops, road workers, libraries etc?

Obviously, rape is bad for a ton of reasons. I do actually agree that it is preferable not to violate consent when it is not necessary for some greater good, all else being equal. BUT it is not the most important thing in life. The difference between rape and taxes is that taxes don't generally inflict massive harm upon the lives of those paying them, and unlike rape, taxes have important upsides that more than balance out the negatives in many circumstances (enabling collective action, resolving externalities, funding common interests, etc).\n\n&gt; Look up the definition I provided, you'll find it's not mine. \n\nWhile the definition of theft you provided is not yours, it relies on that word, \"wrongful\". Violating someone's consent is often but not always wrong. If I was unconscious and dying, I would not want the doctor to obtain my consent before saving my life. If I am dumping waste into a communal pond to save a quick buck, and ruining the water for everyone, imposing fines against my consent on dumping drastically improves conditions for the whole community.

Agreement doesn't have any basis in objectivity - if everyone spontaneously agrees that I own Nigeria because I'm a crocodile, then I would own Nigeria. Regardless of whether I was, in fact, a crocodile. In a political sense, it's uninteresting, because politics starts where agreement ends.\n\nThe only objective method to determine the most fundamental tier of ownership is who can enforce ownership.

It's just an expression of opinion, and that's not a good enough reason to base policy on its own.\n\nI'm all for changing society for the better, but it has to be demonstrably better. I'm not for \"I don't like this, or X people don't like this thing, there for it shouldn't be done.\"  That's fine for personal beliefs and actions, but that's not how societies work.  They're based on compromise and tradeoffs.  If you cannot show demonstrable harms or refute the positives, don't make an appeal to values that conflict with others', because that's not convincing.\n\n&gt;There are so many stupid regulations that make it expensive or even impossible for people without heavy capital to start businesses\n\nYes, and those laws can be eased or eliminated where they're shown to have negative impacts.  Despite what conservatives love to strawman, liberals don't believe every law is a good law. We're for selectively deciding case by case which law is beneficial and eliminating the harmful ones.  It's when you make blanket statements like \"Regulating businesses is bad\" that you get pushback, or when you imply that regulations are  the main source of unemployment.\n\nThe article on Texas says \"over a thousand businesses\" were created.  That's great. Seriously, it is.  But how many of those businesses are going to survive the year? Two years? Because generally speaking, the survival rate of new businesses drop sharply to 50% within the first two years, and even lower past that (though it levels off more the longer the time scale).  That means at least 500 of those new businesses are likely to fail with the first two years.\n\nWhich is fine: that's how the market works to find the most efficient and best products and services. What it's not is a solution to poverty: unemployment is never going to go away. What matters is what we do to make sure it's less of a problem, and people can still live and have opportunities even if they fall on hard times. \n\n&gt;over-complication of regulation/law, lack of motive to be efficient, unaccountable (oversight is supposedly by the same people), political influence\n\nThank you for citing all the reasons welfare is inefficient. That was my point, if you'll reread it: you said it is not going to be more efficient to institute a BI, which is what I was refuting.\n\n&gt;Why bother with efficiency when you don't have to participate in the market to win customers?\n\nWhat makes you think efficiency is the only measure of success? I and many others will happily trade some efficiency in the market to ensure clean drinking water and food that won't make us sick.  If you try to compare everything the government tries to do with what the market tries to do, you might as well call fish dumb because they can't fly.\n\n&gt;Libertarians like Friedman preferred BI over welfare because they believed a single program would have less overhead to administer, thus offering the possibility of reduced waste and tax expenditure.

Rather, if you look back 100 years in society, people who had children out of wedlock were often ostracized by their own families. It was considered shameful by many societal demographics. Women had more incentive to keep their legs crossed even though the bad boy showed interest, and instead wait for the beta male good provider who maybe was a bit less sexy.

This results in skewed election results, as the views of older citizens are more represented. And of course, sometimes younger votes may be overrepresented instead, should they vote more.\n\nWhy not normalize the votes by demographics? As an example, let's divide the voting population into three age groups: young (35%), middle (40%), old (25%). \n\nIf 50% of all votes in an election come from the old group, it means they are vastly overrepresented. Instead, the 50% of the old votes could be normalized so that they represent only 25% of the votes (to match the old age group demographics). This means one vote from the old group would have less value in this example.\n\nAlso, if 10% of all votes come from the young group, then they would be normalized to represent 35% of the total votes. Every vote from the young group would be more valuable.\n\nIn fact, there could be several criteria to use to determine the demographic voting groups: age brackets, sex, ethnicity, orientation, wealth.. and so forth.\n\nThe advantage of this would be that every group in society has a fair representation of their views.
