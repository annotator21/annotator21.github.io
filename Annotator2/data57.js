But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. Neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.\n\nTransgenderism need not cause dysfunction or distress, and when it does, it is a perfectly expectable reaction to being in a body that does not match one's identity.

Transition is the only widely-effective and long-term treatment existed.\n\n&gt; Finally I would like to add that having a mental disorder doesn't necessarily make you unstable, sad, or not productive- in fact, it can be quite the opposite for certain things, such as forms of OCD.\n\nTo be pathological it *must*, by definition, produce dysfunction or harm. To quote the DSM's own text:\n\n&gt; ...although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of \u2018mental disorder.\u2019 The concept of mental disorder, like many other concepts in medicine and science, lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations...\n\n&gt; Despite these caveats, the definition of mental disorder that was included in DSM-III and DSM-III-R is presented here because it is as useful as any other available definition and has helped to guide decisions regarding which conditions on the boundary between normality and pathology should be included in DSM-IV. In DSM-IV, each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as **a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.** In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. Neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.\n\nTransgenderism need not cause dysfunction or distress, and when it does, it is a perfectly expectable reaction to being in a body that does not match one's identity. Men with gynecomastia or women who undergo mastectomies display similar distress, for a more extreme case see [David Reimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer)."}, {"id": "cmij0aj", "body": "&gt;Sure, it's possible in principle.

It seems to be more suppression than genuine improvement. Transition is the only widely-effective and long-term treatment existed.\n\n&gt; Finally I would like to add that having a mental disorder doesn't necessarily make you unstable, sad, or not productive- in fact, it can be quite the opposite for certain things, such as forms of OCD.\n\nTo be pathological it *must*, by definition, produce dysfunction or harm. To quote the DSM's own text:\n\n&gt; ...although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of \u2018mental disorder.\u2019 The concept of mental disorder, like many other concepts in medicine and science, lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations...\n\n&gt; Despite these caveats, the definition of mental disorder that was included in DSM-III and DSM-III-R is presented here because it is as useful as any other available definition and has helped to guide decisions regarding which conditions on the boundary between normality and pathology should be included in DSM-IV. In DSM-IV, each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as **a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.** In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. Neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.\n\nTransgenderism need not cause dysfunction or distress, and when it does, it is a perfectly expectable reaction to being in a body that does not match one's identity. Men with gynecomastia or women who undergo mastectomies display similar distress, for a more extreme case see [David Reimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer)."}, {"id": "cmjbdux", "body": "&gt; The better question would be why we feel the need to treat one's identification at all.\n\nbecause our society is hung up on sex to a ridiculous degree.  any interaction between the sexes seems to be falling under one regulation or another, out of fear of accidental exposure of someone to the sight of another person's genitals.  the idea of a man with a woman's parts (or vise versa) is pretty much the perfect storm to short circuit those with a puritanical mindset.\n\ni don't agree with the mindset, but it's the obvious answer.\n\nbtw, great original post.

The thing is that Gender identity disorder was reclassified to gender dysphoria because you can't really 'treat' GID, at least without engaging in some seriously ethically questionable practices. Gender dysphoria, however, has so far proven to be marvelously treatable through things like HRT and transition. Exactly what works best is going to vary, of course, but the medical community spent the better part of a century trying to get transgender people to do anything *but* transition. Transition tends to work *really* well, at least for trans people seeking that. So the question then is: with a treatment already so effective, why do we need to seek something else out? I can say that lots of transgender people, for our part, aren't really looking for something else to 'cure us', and by and large when we do that's often the consequence of social forces rather than dysphoria.

But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

The reason we use 'assigned' instead of just 'what you were' is that it's ambiguous in a surprisingly large number of cases.\n\n&gt; Being a person who views yourself as the opposite sex from what you are born should be seen as a disorder, while you still have dissonance between what your head thinks and what your body displays. But once a successful treatment is implemented, surgical or otherwise, I think you should be considered \"cured,\" and that you no longer have a disorder.\n\nI would argue that it is not a *mental* disorder, though, which is what OP was raising.\n\n&gt; The idea that it shouldn't be regarded as a disorder to think you should have a vagina and then look down and see a penis is, honestly, crazy to me. Because that's gotta be fucking traumatic to look down and see a penis if you really think you're supposed to have a vagina. That's a goddamn problem and it needs to be addressed. How you want to address it is your business, but until you address it, how can you say there's \"nothing wrong\" with you?\n\nI didn't say nothing was wrong - obviously things are wrong. But the problem is the mismatch, not the identification: dysphoria is the problem, not transgenderism *per se*. And this is a very important distinction.\n\nBy analogy, imagine a beautifully crafted hammer (your brain) and a beautifully crafted screw (your body). Both can be totally fine alone, but they may not mesh properly; a bog-standard nail might be more functional in this situation than a beautifully crafted screw.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that not all trans people focus on genitals in this way. I'm okay with my penis, although if I could snap my fingers and have functional girl-bits I'd certainly prefer that. For me, the biggest thing I wanted was breasts, a flat chest always seemed 'off' to me.\n\n&gt; I don't know... I just hope trans people can understand that a trans mentality can be a very difficult for a cis person to understand, even when we really try. We don't mean to be rude or condescending or make you feel odd (I'm sure you feel odd enough without everyone else weighing in), we just don't usually get it. We don't know we're being insensitive. I think talking openly about... transgenderedness?... is a relatively new thing, and it's going to take time, experience, and open and honest conversations for the topic to stop being controversial.\n\nThis is stuff that most of us - barring a few idiots from tumblr that we'd all very much like to shut up - do understand. We know it's unfamiliar, and we're willing to provide guidance on that most of the time. That being said, OP advanced a positive claim, not \"I'm unsure about this\". Someone unsure in the way you're talking about shouldn't be making positive claims.\n\n&gt; My whole point is, I think viewing yourself as a different sex than what you see in the mirror absolutely is abnormal (as in, it's not common, and is probably the result of something that went wrong in the womb, ie. an abnormality)\n\nThe issue here is that you - probably unconsciously - identify \"abnormal\" with \"wrong\". Those are very importantly not the same thing.\n\nIn the strictest sense of rarity, yes, it is abnormal. But we'd avoid the term like the plague, because \"abnormal\" is almost never used without some emotional charge to it.\n\n&gt; &lt;surgery stuff&gt;\n\nYeah, MTF surgery is pretty damn solid. It's expensive and it's a MAJOR surgery with a very long recovery period (you can't have sex for something like six months to a year). That being said, you may be unaware, but surgery is not at all all there is to transition - hormones do a *lot*.\n\n&gt; But I have no idea how you sit until your surgery heals. I would probably just lie on my back for a couple of months.\n\nWell, you don't, for like a week. And you avoid stuff like bike seats for a while after that.\n\n&gt; As a question: Do you still think of yourself as \"trans,\" or do you just consider yourself a woman?\n\nBoth. \"Trans\" is a modifier on \"woman\", not a replacement for it.\n\n...is the answer I'd give in a discussion like this. Speaking of my more private feelings, I'm only recently getting to the point of not feeling like an intruder in womens' spaces and feeling comfortable expressing myself as a woman more publicly. I try very, VERY hard not to play to the \"gay as a fairy in a dress with a beard\" kind of stereotype, but that sometimes means suppressing some of my expression until my appearance matches well enough. It sucks, but I'm starting to pass better and be more accepted; once in a while I even wear a dress that would be considered scandalous in certain Amish communities.\n\n&gt; If it was me, it would kinda piss me off if everyone insisted on calling me \"trans\" after I had surgery. Like, \"Goddamnit, I went through a lot of shit for this, and now I'm a woman! I'm not different anymore, I'm like everyone else.\" \n\nAnd many trans folk do feel that way - I'd peg it as a significant majority. My past never brought me pain, though, so I feel no particular need to forget it. I try to integrate the pieces of the boy I once was into the woman I am today - I'm still me, I'm just...well, girl-me, if that makes sense. In the same way that I was once child-me, then teen-me, then adult-me.\n\n&gt; Can we just eliminate the use of \"trans\" completely when referring to people \"after treatment.\" I mean, their body now matches their mind, so they're not \"transgendered\" anymore. Now they're cis.\n\nNo, they're still not cis, because while their gender identity matches their body *now* it doesn't match their gender as assigned at birth.\n\n&gt; I can't imagine how awful it is to not be the right sex for what you feel in your mind. If I woke up with a penis tomorrow, I would probably cut it off myself, bleed out and die. And that's how imagine it is for transgender people. Which is terrible, and you have my sympathy. \n\nDepends on the person. Occasionally, someone will do exactly that. More commonly, people can be really, *really* upset about it - a friend of mine is very nervous about anyone seeing her torso because she's embarrassed to have hair there (she's very early in her transition and still apparently male).

I place scientific truth over political goals and always will, but I can certainly understand the attitude that if it saves lives it's a position we should promote. I just think undermining honesty in medicine is more dangerous in the long run.\n\n&gt; Doesn't modifying \"woman\" by saying \"transwoman\" make it seem like saying you're \"different from a woman\"?

That space is the distinction between a modifier on and a replacement for. \n\nIt doesn't matter for most purposes, but for the moment it is perfectly obvious in my case: I haven't got my voice where I want it, and when I'm teaching I don't even really try because there's no way I could hold even my work-in-progress voice for an hour lecture. But it is sometimes relevant: for instance, I'll let a doctor know because hormones put me at increased risk of (e.g.) pulmonary embolism.\n\n&gt; But on a serious note: Do you choose to wear a beard?

Imagine if your 'few upper lip' hairs were a full ring around your breasts, a moderate covering on your stomach, and a full beard, and you'll have some idea how annoying basic daily grooming is at this point for me :P\n\nI've not met any trans women who choose to wear a beard. I'm sure they exist, and to be honest it seems a bit strange to me too. For myself, internally, I can see no good reason to judge them for it; but as a politician I'm acutely aware that such things do not help our case.\n\n&gt; Why does the gender assigned at birth even matter?\n\nBecause it does matter, a great deal. It shouldn't, but it does. It determines how we're treated by the vast majority of the world. If one of your girlfriends told you tomorrow that she'd been born male, it would be difficult for you to see her the same way even from your accepting point of view. Take that to extremes, and people like me get hung in the town square in a reasonably large part of the world.\n\n&gt; I guess what I mean is, I thought that every transwoman feels like they should've been born a ciswoman, and the same with men. So, if they have surgery, would they feel more comfortable if they were no longer designated as a trans person?\n\nSome do.

But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous.\n\nI don't know that they do contradict each other.  Is it not possible that gender is innate for some and not for others?  This could especially be true if we accept the idea that there only being two genders is entirely arbitrary.  Also don't some trans people choose the opposite gender while some choose a third gender or no gender at all?  This would seem to support the idea that gender is more complex then male/female.\n\nI think the real issue here is how our society views identity and mental illness.\n\nMental rehabilitation has moral and legal implications in the sense that \"mental and emotional health\" resides in what society mandates *should* be.  \n\nObviously when it comes to treating someone we ask the question, \"is this person happy,\" or \"is this person functional\" both questions being highly subjective for both the individual and the health care provider. \n\nIn the cases of certain SMI's (psychopathy, severe narcissism) the individual may regard themselves as happy and may appear perfectly happy and \"functional\" however they are deemed harmful to everyone else.  In these cases the function of diagnoses is *most* obvious as a means towards societal discipline.  However if we take the wide variety of mental disorders we see societal expectations creeping in to the fundamental manifestation of the disorder and the inherent \"problem.\"\n\nNow I say this as someone who has dealt with mania and depression and I love my antipsychotic medication *and* my therapist.  So don't think I am implying that people with SMI's do not actually need help and are just mistreated by everyone else.  I was miserable and disruptive, now I am happy and productive, all great things.  However this change would never have happened without my own personal commitment *to* change and to become effectively a very different person.  \n\nMental illnesses are not concrete and overt like a broken leg or heart disease.  Everyone lies on a spectrum of these issues and the extent to which you deal with it is often determined by societal factors.  I know many people, for example, who just sort of feel like unhappiness is the norm, that to actually actively pursue your own individual happiness by forging a unique personality and life is absurd and arrogant.  This is mostly anecdotal but I think if you talk to many people from families with poverty, mental illness, or some other form of abuse in their background you will find there have been generations of human beings who did not think \"being happy\" was a priority or even a thing.  The pursuit of happiness is a true precious luxury.  Which is the reason I choose to believe why so many people are hateful towards those who *do* choose to spread their wings and become the people they want to be.  It upsets them because they have resigned themselves to misery and they want others to be there too.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that the way we value certain behaviors over others and certain changes as being beneficial, and others as being negative are culturally and individually determined.  Psychology and psychiatry simply are not hard proven sciences and the modern day therapist is not far from clergy, counselor, any profession that simply seeks to provide emotional support to people.  The only *reason* we have the DSM is to try to find out we might go about *treating* a patient, but ultimately that treatment has to be specially tailored towards the individual with the health care provider and patient working as equals in a team (the whole Freudian authoritarian has been widely debunked as effective care).  From this perspective the DSM is almost like a journal of anecdotes suggesting what has worked for some people, but the treatments are rarely tried and true.\n\nNow if we accept that the mental health care system's sole purpose should be to help people and that which behaviors are harmful and which are healthy are intersubjectively prioritized by the individual and society, then this whole \"is transgender a mental illness?\" is really a cultural/moral struggle and is not a medical debate.\n\nSo I put it like this:\n\nIf transgender people tell you that they exist and are *not* ill then the only reason *you* can possibly have for naming them as mentally ill is that you believe what they do is so disruptive, so dysfunctional just in and of itself that it should be stopped, and you simply do not believe them when they tell you *they exist*.  \n\nSaying that transgender is a mental illness is just another way of marginalizing those people.  We should come out and say what this debate really *is* about.  It is not about science, it is about the same thing marginalized people have always been struggling for, recognition as people with value equal to anyone else."}, {"id": "cmih4oh", "body": "Well, to some extent, we still are - the DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a disorder of sexual development (although I will point out that the ICD didn't drop classifying homosexuality as an illness until the 90s, decades after the DSM).

Prolly doesn't mean that much coming from an internet stranger but w.e"}, {"id": "cmih4oh", "body": "Well, to some extent, we still are - the DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a disorder of sexual development (although I will point out that the ICD didn't drop classifying homosexuality as an illness until the 90s, decades after the DSM). But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror.

A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

I aka believe though that gender roles are a social construct. The two ideas are completely contradictory.\n\nNot at all. Gender identity (aka \"brain sex\") and gender roles are two separate things. It is a fact that the human brain is sexually dimorphic...that has nothing to do with the gender expectations we pin on people based on their sex. Someone who likes cooking, pink, and dresses can still identify as a man (whether they are trans or not).\n\n &gt; it seems too improbable to me that anyone would be transgender.\n\nBeing transgender has nothing to do with gender roles whatsoever. I've heard many, many trans folk say that even if they lived on a desert island, away from the pressures of society, they would *still* want to transition. \n\nBeing trans is about gender dysphoria. It's not \"I like trucks and sports; I want to be male\". It's more like, \"having breasts makes me want to fucking kill myself; I want to be male\". Being trans is about how you feel about your body and the sex hormones that flood it. \n\nIt should be pointed out that many trans men are feminine, and many trans women are masculine. Again, there's no correlation with gender roles.\n\n&gt; I also think it is wrong to let kids decide when they are young what gender they are, as OP says.\n\nTreatment of transgender children is geared towards delaying all permanent decisions for as long as possible. If a mental health professional thinks it's in the best interests of a gender dysphoric child to transition, all that's done is changing things like hair and clothing, names and pronouns. No medical changes are made. \n\nTrans kids are constantly being reassessed to determine what's best for them. If the kid still identifies as trans and experiences dysphoria right around the time they're about to hit puberty, then they're put on hormone blockers. Hormone blockers prevent puberty from occurring. This is important because puberty is generally torture for trans kids (I've heard it described as \"being trapped in a burning building\"), not to mention it makes transitioning in the future more difficult and expensive.\n\nIf by the late teens, the kid still identifies as trans, they're now at an age where they can give informed consent to medical treatments. At this time, they go off the hormone blockers and start hormone replacement therapy (testosterone or estrogen for trans guys or trans girls respectively). The hormone therapy essentially causes them to go through the puberty of the opposite sex.\n\nIf, while on hormone blockers the gender dysphoria goes away and the kid no longer identifies as trans, then it's not a big deal, they'll simply go off the hormone blockers and their natural puberty will resume."}, {"id": "cmitovc", "body": "I don't think it is a disorder, and I'm all for treating people as they want to be.

But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)).

But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

And that's enough. Maybe one day we can do it with reproductive capabilities too, but until then..."}, {"id": "cmih4oh", "body": "Well, to some extent, we still are - the DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a disorder of sexual development (although I will point out that the ICD didn't drop classifying homosexuality as an illness until the 90s, decades after the DSM). But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions.

Different cultures will express it differently, but there are common underlying tones, like men liking  to compete with each other a lot and women finding that borderline stupid. \n\nMy point is that transgenderism should no longer be seen as gender and sex not matching. It should be seen as two aspects of sex not matching, namely prenatal T release masculinizing genitals and brains. In your case your genitals got mascuclinized, your brain not. Then your gentials went on to produce T and your brain said \"nope I can't deal with that\". Then you got T blockers and you got well. This is pure biology, pure sex, and should have nothing to do with gender.\n\nMaybe I am not expressing the idea very clearly. Gender means all kinds of socially constructed stuff like wearing skirts and make-up. However your brain is not hardwired for that stuff, nobody's is, rather your brain is hardwired to express yourself as one of the _gentil sesso_ and it is entirely cultural how exactly that gets expressed. The idea is that your brain is merely hardwired to express more... gentleness and less of that kind of fierce manly competitiveness. This is biology, not social gender. It is not your biological sex that mismatched your social gender, but two aspects of your biological sex mismatched each other. Your balls wanted to produce T and your brain wanted none of that. This should be seen as two different aspects of biological sex. Gender is the variable social expression of the fixed biological sexualization of the brain, in your case, a feminine brain.\n\nThis is why I think transgender theory is outdated. If it is merely the mismatch of biological sex and social gender, then some pretty clothes would fix it. But they did not - you needed the T blockers.

Its hard for me to imagine that they would be asking anything else. It clearly doesn't mean \"do you look like a dude?\" or anything that touches on the complexities of the biology and evolution of separate sexes. "}, {"id": "cmih4oh", "body": "Well, to some extent, we still are - the DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a disorder of sexual development (although I will point out that the ICD didn't drop classifying homosexuality as an illness until the 90s, decades after the DSM). But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally.

But I would say we aren't, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.\n\n------------\n\nLet's start with the material support for our identification:\n\nAs best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. \n\nMoreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merited publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.\n\n---------------\n\nTwo, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\nCompare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).\n\n-----------\n\nThree, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.\n\nThis is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nOf particular interest are your claims about children. While I know of no systematic study on young children, I'd ask why you feel it would be traumatic to have their feelings respected. If we go a little older, systematic studies do exist: [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) is a recent study on 55 pre- or early-pubescent trans children who took (reversible) puberty blockers to delay their decisions. Every single one (100%) ultimately did transition, none (0%) regretted taking blockers, and they were on average on par with or actually mentally healthier than their peers years later.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for the social construct thing - if taken to extremes, it does indeed contradict the idea of innate gender identity. But those extremes are, frankly, ludicrous. On the basis of hormone differences alone, obviously there are differences between the sexes, as anyone who's been through puberty can tell you. There is plenty of dimorphism between male and female bodies and no particular reason to think that would not extend to the brain; plenty of data indicates that there is in fact a difference in the brain.\n\nThe material support given above provides pretty strong data in favor of an at-least-partially-innate basis to gender identity. Now, the fact that gender identity appears to be innate does *not* mean that adherence to particular gender *roles* is. The fact that most (although not all) trans people do adhere loosely to the gender roles of the gender we identify with is not hard to explain: by analogy, let's consider sexuality. Even though sexuality is clearly not socially constructed (since it predates culture), the *methods of expressing* sexuality are often cultural. A man in Pakistan might approach a woman's father or a woman in Norway might ask her co-worker out to dinner, but in both cases they are expressing an innate tendency through a cultural lens.\n\nIn short: gender identity and gender roles are different things. The process usually, but not always, proceeds: \"I am a man/woman\" + \"men/women wear blue/pink\" -&gt; \"I should wear blue/pink\". But just as not all cis (not trans) people conform to those stereotypes, not all trans people do either, because not everyone accepts these culturally-normative ideas as their personal method of expression.\n\n-------------------\n\nSetting aside the broad study, let me speak personally. I am a trans woman. I am:\n\n* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.\n\n* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really *mine* and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.\n\n* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.\n\nWith due respect to the question, I want to ask you one as well - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.\n\nI don't begrudge you some doubts - it's obviously a pretty counter-intuitive thing.

In science, that is where laws come from: things that we observe. The theories are the parts of science which try and explain the laws. For something to be a law, it just has to produce characteristic and observable behavior.\n\nI try and explain this same issue to my friends all the time. Typical conversations are like, \"I just don't understand why this is a big deal,\" says all of my friends. So I explain it to them as best as I can. Then my friends say, \"that's bullshit. That wouldn't bother me (i.e. most people), so it couldn't possibly bother you.\" So I explain to them, \"well it was a big deal to me,  and it's fine that you don't understand it. We are different people. I don't expect you to know when things will hurt my feelings, but aren't you at least sorry that you did?\" If they aren't sorry they hurt my feelings, then we aren't friends and never really were. That simple.\n\nKnowing what causes a reaction does not make the reaction go away. Just because I can break down my emotions and logically discuss them with my friends does not mean I won't experience those emotions naturally. Just because I can tell you logically why I feel certain emotions does not mean I can change and just feel different emotions. Likewise, knowing that anorexia/bulimia is stupid  and causes permanent damage to my body in the long run doesn't make the nausea go away. Knowing that depression is an imbalance of hormones ultimately changes nothing about the way I see myself. I pursued science specifically because I thought understanding the physical processes would help me control them, but I can tell you first hand that it doesn't. \n\nTo tie it all back together, the **laws** (the emotions I experience) will exist as they always have no matter how well developed the **theories** (explanations for why I may have these emotions) are.\n\nThat is how the scientific process works, and I wonder if people were made to get degrees in scientific fields if more people would understand and apply this line of thinking to their own lives, thus expanding their capacity to be accepting.

Your mind is *much* more \"you\" than your body.  Your body just carries \"you\", your mind, around.  If your mind says that you're female but your body says otherwise, why is your mind the one that's wrong?\n\n&gt; Also I have read that many people who get the surgery end up regretting it.\n\nYour mind and body may not match, but your body is still your body, and getting rid of a part of it can be traumatic even if it's a part you don't like.  Then again, I haven't actually read the material you're talking about.  How did the people you've studied feel?  How many is \"many people\"?  Was this a representative sample?  Who wrote the study, who funded it, and did they have any agenda to promote?"}, {"id": "cmipagn", "body": "&gt;Gender is a social construct\n\nWhy do people assume this? \n\n&gt;Your mind is much more \"you\" than your body.\n\nWhy?\n"}, {"id": "cmipagn", "body": "&gt;Gender is a social construct\n\nWhy do people assume this? \n\n&gt;Your mind is much more \"you\" than your body.\n\nWhy?\n"}, {"id": "cmixt8e", "body": "&gt; Gender is a social construct\n\n&gt; Why do people assume this?\n\nBecause different societies construct it differently?  I mean, this is observable.  Not to mention that the simple existence of genders other than simple male and female indicates that the male-female dynamic isn't complete, or else it would apply to everyone and it does not.\n\n&gt; Your mind is much more \"you\" than your body.\n\n&gt; Why?\n\nHm, I'm not sure how to properly answer this because it's just so obvious, anyone else want to give it a try?  Your mind is what does the thinking.  Your mind is where your consciousness is.  When \"you\" do anything, your mind processes it, with itself as the center of awareness.  If you lose your arm or your leg or your penis, you are still you.  If you could switch minds with someone else, you would still be you but in a different body.  The story of your experiences -- and your connectome, the map of neuron connections in your brain -- that is who you are.  Now, external factors certainly affect your decision making.  Your body is constantly sending signals to your brain to get it to change its behavior.  In particular, testosterone and estrogen, as well as the physical condition of your genitals, affects your state of mind regarding sexuality.  But since your continuity resides in your mind -- the story of every moment leading to now -- if these hormones change or your genitals change, you will perceive it in your mind as a difference to your condition and add to your continuity.  If your penis becomes engorged or your vagina becomes lubricated, you may desire sex more fervently, for example.  But it's still *you* desiring it, because your sense of identity, your continuity, lives in your mind.  Cells live and die; molecules are replaced repeatedly, but the you that connects them is your sense of self, which is something your mind does, not your body."}, {"id": "cmipagn", "body": "&gt;Gender is a social construct\n\nWhy do people assume this? \n\n&gt;Your mind is much more \"you\" than your body.\n\nWhy?\n"}, {"id": "cmivewj", "body": "Gender is a social construct because it varies so much cross-culturally.

Identifying with a gender means literally absolutely nothing at all.\n\nWeird that transgender is even a thing under such circumstances. I have no problem accepting transgender-ism now, but it has taken a lot of work to expand my world view in this regard. Everyone struggles, blah blah blah, etc, etc. This question is really bothering me, and is the main reason for the struggle.\n\nIt's hard for me to accept gender as a concept, and so therefore people who feel like they have the wrong gender especially boggle me!\n\nThis question has identified the source of my problem, while in the meantime all I have been doing is treating the symptoms.

I have to have thoughts. I'm not sure all of this is related to my problem, but it may be."}, {"id": "cmij67u", "body": "If someone believed they were God, you would call that a disorder.  But if someone thought they were a woman, you wouldn't necessarily call that a disorder.  After all, there are people who believe they are a woman, and you agree with them.  But if someone legitimately believed they were God, you would think they were delusional. It would be a belief which is at odds with reality (I'm assuming this person also never does anything supernatural).  Also, anyone who claims to be God would fail any test which tried to verify their claim.  The claim would be true or false independent of what body parts they have.\n\nSo what test is there to find out if someone is a woman?\n\nPerhaps the only test is to ask them.  I mean, you don't have to be able to do anything to be a woman, do you?  That is, every attribute that one would ascribe to womanhood is not necessary.  For example, a woman (born female and everything) who can't have children would still be a woman.  A woman who can't grow breasts would still be a woman.  A woman with a deep voice would still be a woman.\n\nSo the only test is to ask that person (presuming they aren't lying, but \"real\" women can lie, too, so let's just assume we're dealing with the cases where the person tells the truth).\n\nAsking someone if they're God is *not* the only test, and certainly not the correct one.  If someone is God, they should be able to do something supernatural of some sort.\n\nAnother thing to ponder is this.  If someone claims \"I like ice cream\", and they know what the words mean and they aren't lying, could they be mistaken?  Of course, if they were talking about someone else, they could be mistaken, e.g. \"Jim over there likes ice cream\" and the statement could be false even if they knew what the words meant and they weren't lying (not lying here just means they believe the statement is true).\n\nBut if they say it about themselves, and they know what the words mean and they aren't lying, could the statement be false?  I would say no.  Perhaps gender identity is in the same camp?  That is, if I know what it means to be a woman, and I'm not lying, can I be factually incorrect when I claim \"I am a woman\"? (for the record, I identify as a man and was born male).\n\nNow the only weakness is whether or not someone can know what it means to be a woman.  I mean, we all know what it means to like or not like ice cream, but maybe gender identity is still different.\n\nJust a couple things to consider."}, {"id": "cmiwf8s", "body": "The problem with that is that it renders the word ''woman'' meaningless, if the definition becomes ''anyone who thinks they are a woman, is a woman'' ... well ok then, what is a woman?"}, {"id": "2o02ul", "body": "I don't get why it is so taboo to suggest that these people are living with a mental health disorder.

In order to understand why, you need a small primer on human gestation. \n\nWhile in the womb we are all females developmentally until we differentiate. This is why men have nipples. This process is triggered by the release of hormones, mostly testosterone and estrogen. The exact timing, volume, and duration of the hormones cause a number of changes in the body and brain of the child. This can lead to any number of outcomes, for example this is considered a likely candidate for a partial cause of sexual preference. The child is born with whatever gender their mother's body has produced. Their genetic make up is actually not the only cause of gender expression, it is largely influenced by the mother. Once the child reaches puberty the body starts producing these hormones for itself, causing the development of gender traits such as breasts and body hair. In one rare case a mother have birth to 5 girls who were genetically male. 4 of the 5 went on to develop male genitals at puberty and completed an unassisted gender transition. One of the men committed suicide, he was unable to cope with the changes. Suffice to say, this is a clear indicator that a gender mix up can occur in nature, but also other things to do with gender and sexually can be affected by the time in the womb. \n\nSo if we want to call transsexuals mentally ill then we need to call all gays, bisexuals, and straights mentally ill, because it is set by the same mechanism.

The body developed into one sex (or sometimes ambiguously), but due to some kind of anomaly or 'error' in brain's development, the brain ended up developing to have more in common with brains of the other sex, resulting in the person's contrasting sex and gender identity. Neither the brain or the body is necessarily 'wrong', its just that the two don't fit comfortably together.\n\nIt seems that the main choices for such a person are:\n\n1) Leave things are they are and try to cope as well as possible.\n\n2) Attempt to change one's body to approximate the features of the other sex as much as possible. This can be helpful, but I wonder if its naive to simply see this as a corrective measure that will necessarily be helpful for the person.\n\n3) To (theoretically) attempt to change the brain to match with one's physical features. This may well be unfeasible, and raises ethical questions.\n\n4) Attempt psychological therapy to help the person to feel more comfortable with their sex. Note that in some cultures, such as in Thailand, they do have a concept of a third identity between male and female. Perhaps if we were to develop such a concept in the west, and it could be seen as more acceptable for someone to not clearly fit in the the category of either sex/gender, then many transgender people might be able to feel more at ease with the way that they are born.\n\nI don't see why it should necessarily be seen as a bad thing for someone to have a brain/mind that contrasts with their physical features.
