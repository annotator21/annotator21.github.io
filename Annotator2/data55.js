This is where I'll confess my ignorance, I don't know much about guns and weapons, but it seems to me that these things are all just as good at incapacitating somebody. How necessary is it for officers to have lethal capability? Maybe there's a deterrence factor, but aren't all these recent police shootings evidence that deterrence often fails with tragic results?\n\nEvery one of these can be shrugged off or avoided. A winter coat can stop a TASER. OC spray won't stop a determined -or high- person. Bean bag guns/tear gas require specialized equipment and you run into similar problems. NONE of these things are useful when a man with a gun, or hell, a KNIFE, is running at you trying to kill you.

When you stop to think about it, it's a little bit absurd.  We equip police officers with this tool that they are only supposed to use in the most extreme circumstances, and even when they use it justifiably they come under extremely intense scrutiny.  It's a set-up for controversy and failure.  \n\nSecondly, is there something inherently less effective about non-lethal weapons, such as mace, tazers, beanbag guns, tear gas, etc.?  This is where I'll confess my ignorance, I don't know much about guns and weapons, but it seems to me that these things are all just as good at incapacitating somebody.  How necessary is it for officers to have lethal capability?  Maybe there's a deterrence factor, but aren't all these recent police shootings evidence that deterrence often fails with tragic results?\n\nFinally, is there any reason why a separate force equipped specifically to respond to armed threats would be ineffective?  Again, I recognize there are big hurdles in terms of manpower and cost.  On the other hand, how much money is wasted on the legal battles that ensue nearly every time a police officer draws his firearm?  \n\nJust so you know, my mind can definitely be changed on this, I don't have all the pieces together in my head and I suspect there is some reason why this sort of arrangement wouldn't work.  Change my view!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who responded (or is still responding).  The consensus seems to be that the non-lethal (less lethal) technology just isn't there, but I have yet to be convinced that there is any more fundamental reason why lethal threats must be addressed with lethal force.  So, a hypothetical follow-up prompt for those still following this thread:  if non-lethal (less lethal) weapons were available and effective at disarming armed criminals, would you still prefer police officers to be armed with actual firearms?  What if the non-lethal weapons were only slightly less effective than firearms?  At what point would they be worth using?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

When you stop to think about it, it's a little bit absurd.  We equip police officers with this tool that they are only supposed to use in the most extreme circumstances, and even when they use it justifiably they come under extremely intense scrutiny.  It's a set-up for controversy and failure.  \n\nSecondly, is there something inherently less effective about non-lethal weapons, such as mace, tazers, beanbag guns, tear gas, etc.?  This is where I'll confess my ignorance, I don't know much about guns and weapons, but it seems to me that these things are all just as good at incapacitating somebody.  How necessary is it for officers to have lethal capability?  Maybe there's a deterrence factor, but aren't all these recent police shootings evidence that deterrence often fails with tragic results?\n\nFinally, is there any reason why a separate force equipped specifically to respond to armed threats would be ineffective?  Again, I recognize there are big hurdles in terms of manpower and cost.  On the other hand, how much money is wasted on the legal battles that ensue nearly every time a police officer draws his firearm?  \n\nJust so you know, my mind can definitely be changed on this, I don't have all the pieces together in my head and I suspect there is some reason why this sort of arrangement wouldn't work.  Change my view!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who responded (or is still responding).  The consensus seems to be that the non-lethal (less lethal) technology just isn't there, but I have yet to be convinced that there is any more fundamental reason why lethal threats must be addressed with lethal force.  So, a hypothetical follow-up prompt for those still following this thread:  if non-lethal (less lethal) weapons were available and effective at disarming armed criminals, would you still prefer police officers to be armed with actual firearms?  What if the non-lethal weapons were only slightly less effective than firearms?  At what point would they be worth using?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

That takes time to determine, and is still imprecise. \n\n2) It's a lot easier to kill than incapacitate because there is only a minimum threshold of damage you must inflict, no maximum.

It seems like a big part of the problem is that the police is becoming more militarized and treated as a ruling class above \"civilians\" similar to how the military operated in Iraq.  Soldiers in Iraq generally don't intentionally go around shooting innocent bystanders, but they are obviously going to place a higher value on their lives and the lives of their friends than random civilians out on the street.\n\nThe result of all of this seems to be that SWAT is overpowered, overused, and undertrained.

I am a police officer and I have never had to discharge my firearm in the line of duty.  That being said, I have had to use my Taser and pepper spray.  I can honestly tell you that they are not even close to 100% effective.  When they work, GREAT! but sadly they do not always work.  In my area we have a very bad issue with PCP and other drugs that cause a person to feel no pain.  I mean no pain what so ever.  We have had a guy get in a fight with 4 officers at once and no amount of batons, taser, spray, joint locks, or pressure points could prevent this guy from tossing everyone around like rag dolls.  Lethal force was not used in that circumstance because we, luckily, had enough bodies to throw at him when he was encountered.  If I am by myself, I would have been forced to use lethal force just to prevent myself from being a pile of mush on the ground.  He sent 4 officers to the hospital with his fists. These people who are on these drugs are sometimes so aggressive, they will charge down and fight a moving car.  \n\nUnfortunately, the society we live in can be very violent.  You could spend days on Youtube watching interactions with police that begin completely docile and \"routine\" but instantly turn into real combat.  People do not seem to understand that as cops, the last thing we want to do is be forced to discharge our weapons.  I used the word forced because our actions are always dictated by their actions.  That inherent reality requires that our reaction to their use of deadly force or their decision to escalate the situation into a use of force encounter places us at a HUGE disadvantage.  \n\nMost officers will never have to discharge their firearm in the line of duty.  I hope I am one of those lucky officers.  I would rather not be in a shootout outside the world of call of duty.  (no respawns suck).

When you stop to think about it, it's a little bit absurd.\n\nAlmost anyone can acquire lethal firearms in the USA. Sometimes police officers encounter someone carrying firing these weapons, either at civilians or uniformed men. You could argue that incapacitating these people is enough, but how are you going to do this?\n\nUsing non-lethal weapons might work, but you would have to get close, which is more dangerous and takes longer than firing a gun.\n\nAnd sometimes not even guns are enough to incapacitate someone. [Like in this example.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout)\n\nYou cannot split police in armed and unarmed forces, since you don't know how dangerous a person is until you encounter him.\n\nImagine being in a shootout and having to rely on backup because you don't have the firepower to take someone out. If there are hostages, they are almost in the same position as you.\n\n&gt;Maybe there's a deterrence factor, but aren't all these recent police shootings evidence that deterrence often fails with tragic results?\n\nNo, it is the result of civilians being, on average, very dangerous, because any of them could carry the ability to kill someone in their belt.\n\nIf someone is willing to resist arrest, whether or not that person has a gun determines the course of action a police officer should take. But sometimes there is no time to judge on that, and the police officer has to decide whether to risk his own life, or that of someone he is trying to arrest.\n\nThe reason police are shooting more is because there is an **arms race between uniforms and civilians in the United States**. Police-officers have to treat every arrest with the idea in mind that the person could be armed and deadly, and when you are in a backwards neighborhood such as the tragic one in Missouri, guns are even more prevalent.\n\nThis is why police-officers are more trigger-happy in the USA, because they are afraid of their own lives.

We have a ton of guns per capita, and people from law-abiding citizens down to street thugs are all likely to have access to a gun.\n\nI'm not going to argue about gun rights, etc. but you have to understand the mentality that a police officer in the US will have that officers in say, the UK, won't: that the person you are stopping may, however slim the chance, have a weapon on him and is ready to use it. As thus, even if it is a very small chance, multiply that with incredibly horrible results if he does have said weapon and uses it, and you have quite a bit of risk involved in even the most mundane interactions with citizens.\n\nOne point I'd like to point out too is that a lot of people like comparing the US police to police in places like Japan or China or Europe. That ignores a big problem: a comparison of police without guns to society with lots of dangerous potentially armed citizens isn't going to be found being compared to Japan or China.\n\nInstead, the comparison needs to be made to countries that have citizens with access to weapons (legally or illegally). An example may be made with some Central American or North African countries - there, even with gun control, lots of people have guns (often from illegal sources, e.g. cartels). Your common street cop, with no weapons, has little incentive to enforce the laws when the risk of being defenseless against an opponent with firepower is present, even if the actual risk of encountering said person is low.\n\nThink Mexico for a second - how many cops would rather be bribed off by cartels than risk getting killed stopping them while a crime is in progress, especially when said street cops are horribly outgunned?\n\nFinally, consider this. Imagine a population with access to their own guns. Now imagine some unarmed cops showing up to stop a criminal who pulls out his own gun and the unarmed cops flee and wait for armed cops to show up. Which citizen, who has access to their own gun, would EVER feel compelled to call said unarmed cops if a crime happened?\n\nInstead, those citizens would seek their OWN defense more thoroughly than they do today. It's not hard to imagine a rise in vigilantism and taking things into their own hands because of how easy it is for the private citizen to defend themselves when cops are ineffective. The whole point of having an entire section of unarmed cops is then rendered moot."}, {"id": "2o3gkr", "body": "My friend actually had this idea, and I couldn't think of any reasons why it wouldn't be a good solution...at least hypothetically, I do see all the logistical hurdles in terms of paying for and training two separate police forces.  \n\nFirst off, why do your day-to-day patrol officers need lethal firearms?

They are doing a public service, which places a responsibility on their communities to ensure they are equipped appropriately.\n\nRather than nonlethal officers and response officers, I think we should reevaluate the escalation of force.  Whenever police officers respond to unknown environment/incident they are accepting an unknown level of risk and rightfully concerned about their safety.\n\nPrimary response to an unknown threat is for police officers to have their weapon at the ready.  This undoubtedly leads to higher incidence rates of fatalities and wrongful deaths.  To mitigate this, I believe the first three rounds in their service weapon should be nonlethal.

This undoubtedly works very well in compact areas with relatively little need for armed officers and where an armed force could be dispatched relatively quickly.\n\nThis might also work well in areas where there is greater isolation but for whatever reason(socioeconomic, cultural, etc) there is less chance of an individual violently resisting an officer or refusing a lawful order.\n\nHowever, that is not generally the United States. For some reason, it seems people love to compare countries who are smaller, with more concentrated populations, greater homogeneity of population, and differing culture to the United States.\n\nObviously, such comparisons are of little use in general. There are certainly some areas that such a police force model would work well.\n\nHowever, there are many that it would be mind bogglingly dumb. There are plenty of areas of the United States that are isolated enough that a first responder will take 10 minutes or longer to get there.\n\nDo we want the first available officer in a rural area to have to call for backup which is substantially further out because he is not properly equipped to handle an issue? If a firearm is necessary, it is likely by that time the point will be moot.\n\nEither the officer will be injured/killed, or the individual(s) he desired to protect would be. \n\nSo, this all depends on the specifics of the area being policed.

There's really no guarentee that the government doesn't have more advanced AI that *hasn't* been shown yet.  We were developing stealth jets for probably 10 years (and test flights more than likely were mistaken for UFOs) before the government admitted that such planes existed.  I first heard the conspiracy theory of \"Project Echelon\" in the mid 1990's -- the program was designed to be able to capture communications on the internet so that they could later be used to solve crimes or whatever.  In 1990, Echelon was a *conspiracy*, only the idiots believed that the government was going to be able to store and read emails at will.  Except that the revelations of Edward Snowden pretty much were the things that the Project Echelon conspiracy was supposed to do a decade earlier.  The point being that the government has technology that's secret and is working on research projects that they aren't making public.\n\nThat actually brings up the big problem -- the people working on autonomous AI are designing it to use to make *war*.  The biggest research done for the government isn't on the best way to help people, but the best way to eliminate them.  The Defense Department has the best tech people, and they're looking for AI that can automate a shoot/don't shoot situation or pick targets.  As such they really aren't that concerned with the AI being 'friendly' as the term goes.  If it's designed around finding the best way to kill, deciding how to kill, and so on, it's not being designed with the \"don't harm humans\" in the chipset.  Doing so would negate the purpose of the device in question.  \n\nAnd this is the \"big if\" of friendly AI in the first place.  In order for Friendly AI to be made in the first place, the people first past the post with AI of the sort we're talking about have to have an *explicitly humanitarian* use for the robot in mind.  Only someone who cares about humanity over other issues is going to insist that the AI be incapable of harming a human in some way.  Let's suppose our first strong AI is made by a business.  The way it calculates the business decisions being made will be purely utilitarian.  If you don't make the company more than the cost of your pay/benefits, you get sacked.  If the program finds a way to cut benefits legally, it will.  The humans affected don't matter at all.  Not exactly evil, but at the same time, not likely that the programmers are going to say \"don't harm the humans\", as sacking humans and cutting benefits do harm humans.  Military AI would be even further along the line -- you might want the AI to recognize your side as good, but you don't want it to decide that blowing up ISIL is a bad idea.  But to AI, eventually all of us look alike.  If the project was to do something like save people with Ebola (why you need AI to do that is beyond me) that *would* require the friendly AI concept as you don't want the machine to decide that the best way to cure Ebola in Africa is to burn down the whole village when one guy gets a cough (it would technically work, but it would be pretty much genocide and therefore evil).  That outcome would obviously work against the stated goal, but ONLY in the case where you're using the AI to help humans and in no other cases.  In other cases, you don't need the 3 laws of Asimov so there's no reason to program them.  In fact, in most cases the 3 laws would work against the goals of the AI programmers.  The business guy wants to save money no matter the cost.  The military most certainly doesn't want the 3 laws, as they want to kill people.  "}, {"id": "cmjizvi", "body": "The problem is that we really only know the level of technology that's admitted by the government.  There's really no guarentee that the government doesn't have more advanced AI that *hasn't* been shown yet.  We were developing stealth jets for probably 10 years (and test flights more than likely were mistaken for UFOs) before the government admitted that such planes existed.  I first heard the conspiracy theory of \"Project Echelon\" in the mid 1990's -- the program was designed to be able to capture communications on the internet so that they could later be used to solve crimes or whatever.  In 1990, Echelon was a *conspiracy*, only the idiots believed that the government was going to be able to store and read emails at will.  Except that the revelations of Edward Snowden pretty much were the things that the Project Echelon conspiracy was supposed to do a decade earlier.  The point being that the government has technology that's secret and is working on research projects that they aren't making public.\n\nThat actually brings up the big problem -- the people working on autonomous AI are designing it to use to make *war*.  The biggest research done for the government isn't on the best way to help people, but the best way to eliminate them.  The Defense Department has the best tech people, and they're looking for AI that can automate a shoot/don't shoot situation or pick targets.  As such they really aren't that concerned with the AI being 'friendly' as the term goes.  If it's designed around finding the best way to kill, deciding how to kill, and so on, it's not being designed with the \"don't harm humans\" in the chipset.  Doing so would negate the purpose of the device in question.  \n\nAnd this is the \"big if\" of friendly AI in the first place.  In order for Friendly AI to be made in the first place, the people first past the post with AI of the sort we're talking about have to have an *explicitly humanitarian* use for the robot in mind.  Only someone who cares about humanity over other issues is going to insist that the AI be incapable of harming a human in some way.  Let's suppose our first strong AI is made by a business.  The way it calculates the business decisions being made will be purely utilitarian.  If you don't make the company more than the cost of your pay/benefits, you get sacked.  If the program finds a way to cut benefits legally, it will.  The humans affected don't matter at all.

Sure, they could be further down the line than what we know, but it's such an academically challenging problem that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people working on it.

Especially not when you have much better 5 mana cards like Sludge Blecher and Loatheb.\n\nI mean I don't see that many people running Buzzard these days. Bad cards will be bad cards."}, {"id": "cmjb8yz", "body": "All the cards havn't been revealed yet; they may have yet another summon token cards, pushing a token ramp deck."}, {"id": "cmjb8yz", "body": "All the cards havn't been revealed yet; they may have yet another summon token cards, pushing a token ramp deck."}, {"id": "cmjbsw8", "body": "I'm not sure what they could release to make Bolvar good though.\n\nIt'd have to be a pally version of UTH with charge and all. Even then you *have* to draw Bolvar early to get value out of it, making it unreliable and thus not that great. People would just go and play Shockadin or something and forget Bolvar. It's just a sad card :("}, {"id": "2o306q", "body": "I agree with the common sentiment on /r/hearthstone.\n\n1. Bolvar is too slow. If you play it on curve, you get a 4/7, which is a really bad Feugen, since it doesn't have an effect and it can be silenced to a terrible 1/7. But most players won't even draw into it in their first few turns, so by the time you play it, it's already too late in the game to even matter.\n\n2. You can't play it early on because of it's cost. You won't play it late unless you draw into it early, because other cards have better stats for the mana cost. It'll sit in your hand doing nothing.\n\n3. There aren't that many cards that synergize. You really have to play a fast burn aggro deck to get any sort of value out of it. But that kind of deck isn't going to be viable with Paladin because it doesn't fit the Paladin archetype with heals and divine shield. Not even Shockadin is going to work that well with a Bolvar.\n\nSo unless it get buffed, it's a bad card that won't get played except in niche deck. It's not trash-tier like Gelbin or Magma Rager, but it simply gets outclassed by most other cards in the game.\n\nI really want to like this card because I love the righteous-light theme of Paladin. But given the facts, I just can't see how the card is any good...\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Whenever you have a system that involves more than half a million individuals, there are going to be problems. These problems are even more likely when their job involves (and often necessitates) the use of violence/force to do it properly. They are often in very tough positions where their life is in jeopardy, or where they believe it's in jeopardy, which is a whole lot of stress.\n\nWhenever you have all these people with all these incidents under all these stresses you are bound to have abuse.\n\nThe reason you think that the system as a whole is very corrupt is because of selection bias. You only see videos where things go off the rails. You don't see the 95% of interactions that go off without a hitch where no corruption or brutality is involved.\n\nIn 2006 the Justice department released statistics on police brutality. They found that there were 26,556 incidents of police brutality reported, and that of these about 2,000 had merit. Human Rights watch estimated that of incidents that could have involved police brutality, about 30% were reported. There are 570,000 police officers in the US. Now, let's take a look at those statistics. Let's assume, first of all, that the review process for police brutality is flawed. Let's say of the cases where they found brutality to have happened that they should have roughly doubled that. So, that would be 4,000 cases. Let's also assume that all incidents not reported should have been and had equal merit as those that were reported. That would bring us to 13,333 cases of legitimate police brutality per year in the United States.\n\nThere are 570,000 officers in the US. **Even if** each officer only interacted with 1 person per year (obviously ridiculous) that would mean that less that 2% of incidents result in brutality. If we assume that each officer interacts with at least one person per working day (roughly 240) that would bring us down to under 0.001% of police interactions involving brutality. Even with the most generous possible definition of brutality, it would be really tough to get to .1% of incidents involving it.\n\nHowever, all that being said, there are clearly problems with the police departments in the US. There are cases of brutality, and there are cases of corruption. We should strive to fix those.

The woman equally having as much desire for the man as he does for her. \n\nThe woman *wants* to stay, but she's thinking about how her family with scorn her and shame her for it, and how the maid and neighbors will gossip about how she didn't come home last night, and how basically society will shame her for it.

Yeah, that sounds like date rape for sure.
