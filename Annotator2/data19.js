So it is about deciding who to treat (live) and who not to treat (and let die)\n\nAlso, people are not necessarily against organ donation because they consider it explicitally immoral. Many people just can't decide out of status quo bias or something similar. And further, I think my doctor vs. engineer case from above still holds that it's wrong to judge whether someone deserves to live or die based on one very small part of their moral lives is entirely unfair. \"So, you drive a car? Well, cars kill people, so we're going to treat this cyclist first and let you wait.\", \"oh, you vote republican, well you supported the war, so clearly you are in favour of killing people. That tripple bypass operation can wait till we'ver cured this democrat's headche\". If you accept that we should prioritize in the organ situation, why not consider morality in all cases? Clearly my cases are absurd, but I'm sure that if you have time, you can think of some better ones."}, {"id": "cmublw0", "body": "&gt; No, we can decide whether beliefs should have consequences. And that's what we're discussing in this thread. You believe beliefs regarding this should have consequences.\n\nThat's accurate, and it's a good clarification. That said, I think my argument is more based on the principle that holding or not holding a belief and acting on those beliefs does have real-world consequences. For example, not vaccinating one's children not only exposes those children to harmful diseases, it affects everyone else by reducing herd immunity, potentially increasing infection rates among the elderly and children who are too young to be vaccinated. That belief has consequences. In the same way, beliefs prohibiting organ donation have consequences.\n\nI think your cases are, as you point out, absurd because the connection between cause and effect is greatly attenuated. The decision to donate or not donate organs has a very clear effect, whereas driving or voting republican could arguably cause more benefit than harm. I accept that we should prioritize simply because we should encourage, perhaps even coerce people to donate because it will help people and harm no one.

That belief has consequences. In the same way, beliefs prohibiting organ donation have consequences.\n\nAh, yes. That point was lost on me in your original comment. Fair enough. And you're right, that beliefs regarding organ donation *will* affect supply of organs in this case.\n\n&gt; I think your cases are, as you point out, absurd because the connection between cause and effect is greatly attenuated. The decision to donate or not donate organs has a very clear effect, whereas driving or voting republican could arguably cause more benefit than harm.\n\nI think there are two issues here. 1) What is the best way of getting enough organs, and 2) what is the fair/moral thing to do in this regard. You may be right that a prioritizing scheme like the one suggested here will have an effect, I mean, that seems right on the money. The issue for me is strictly the moral issue here. So are you rejecting my examples because it's difficult to gauge the potential harm and benefits in the examples, or are you rejecting them because the idea of prioritizing based on people's actions is actually something which is in conflict with your sense of morality? Are you e.g. ok with prioriticing medical treatment in other cases, e.g. where we can easily ascertain a causal relation between the smoker and his lung cancer? Between the obese and her heart problems? Between the Skier and her broken leg? Again, we're assuming here that the causal relation is clear. So if you reject these examples, it seems to come down to the notion that there is actually something morally wrong in picking and choosing based on such narrow considerations.\n\n&gt; I accept that we should prioritize simply because we should encourage, perhaps even coerce people to donate because it will help people and harm no one. \n&gt; \n\nYou seem to be applying a very narrow view of \"harm\" here. One could however argue, that it harms people to force them to give up their organs. The 'emotional' aspect (for lack of a better word), is quite real to people. Now you may disagree whether their beliefs or views are valid and simply ignore them and adjudicate: those beliefs are irrational. But that's really a different discussion at this point. Further, coercing someone is generally something western societies tend to avoid. But you can of course always solve a bunch of problems through coercion, at least in the short run. However, that's also another can of worms all your opening here, and certainly the fact that it is coercion, counts against something, everything equal.\n\n\n\n&gt; The policy we are proposing also localizes the harm of withholding organs from those who don't think contributing organs is important in a society. It's impossible to calculate how \"good\" people are in a society, so that shouldn't be part of the equation. If Mother Theresa didn't donate organs and died as a result, I would still not take it as evidence that the system was broken.\n\n\nNo, not if you're speaking entirely in terms of efficiency, then it is not evidence that the system is broken. But again, getting enough organs is not problem if we're willing to motivate or coerce people properly. That's not the issue for me. The issue for me is that efficiency is pushing up against morality here. \n\n\nI am pushing you towards the moral issue here, mainly because the discussion of efficiency is uninteresting to me. My own views on the matter, is that an opt out/presumed consent system will do the most of the work here, since I think most people simply have a status quo bias regarding organ donation."}, {"id": "cmu6pls", "body": "Except that it's an incentive that effectively *punishes* people for nothing more than a belief or decision.\n\nMedical care cannot be given out based on personal preferences.\n\nIf that were the case, then we could say something like \"people with motorcycle licences should always get low priority for organ donation\"\n\nIt is unethical to force people to give up the right to their bodies, or to deny them timely medical treatment because of it."}, {"id": "cmubrya", "body": "&gt; It is unethical to force people to give up the right to their bodies\n\nIf they're dead, I find it perfectly ethical.

This doesn't sound like system that would help anybody, as those who don't need assistance may not see any reason to give.\n\nHow does this relate to organ donation? First, religious reasons (though they important, more on that soon) are not the only reason to not be a donor. Health and genetic reasons are the obvious ones. If your organ's just aren't good enough to donate, are you left in a hospital bed to die when you need a donated organ? What if you had an unhealthy lifestyle for whatever reason? Are these people unable to receive aid because they're own organs were not healthy enough to be on a donor list. \n\nNow back to religion. If you say you cannot receive an organ because you're not a donor, and the reason you are not is because of your religion, then you are shutting religious people out of part of the health system.

Think pulling someone off of life support as opposed to trying everything to revive them. \n\nSecond, if your goal is to have more participation in organ donation there needs to be a focus in figuring out a balance between the opt-in and opt-out systems to encourage participation, not punishing people for not participating.

It just seems so unfair to me.\n\nI would love to hear from any one. It would be especially interesting to hear from some one who has chosen not to be an organ donor, but would be OK with receiving an organ if necessary. \n\nThanks CMV!\n\nEdit 1: I am aware using the correct effect/affect is a challenge for me.

You need to take it easy. \n\nEdit 3: Thanks for all the great comments. You have definitely changed my view regarding complications and exceptions making this proposed system not a very good idea.\n\nI still believe that anyone unwilling to donate their organs after their death is some what selfish and that we need to make the organ donation system an opt-out one. \n\nBut no one can play God and deny health care to any one, no matter how selfish they are.\n\nCheers CMV!"}, {"id": "cmu6yb3", "body": "I think we spend entirely too much money/resources on the medical industry.

It's a business model called a news agency[1] . There's nothing illegitimate about running news agency articles, most newspapers do it regularly. In a newspaper, you'll usually see a little note in the byline saying Associated Press or the like. The Christian Science Monitor is a more traditional newspaper, but I would be very confident Yahoo is paying them under an agreement akin to a news agency agreement. \n&gt; Edit to add: here's[2] an example of an Associated Press article in yesterday's New York Times.\n\n*\u2206\nI was unaware that they were actually up to date with this in terms of internet sales of articles, since it seemed to be that most websites have gone down a advertisement or subscription revenue path... still feels a little sketch having big companies do this as opposed to something like Reddit where it tries to link to the original article... but if they've got their structure in place I guess it works. I guess I've just never noticed other big companies like NY times taking AP articles... always seemed like a specifically Yahoo thing.*\n_____\nThis is just something I've been noticing recently while looking at news to share here on /r/news or /r/worldnews ... but Yahoo basically seems to rip articles straight from other websites. It feels like wholesale traffic theft just to get free advertising revenue. Like, seriously... you can pull up an article and [it's got the entire webpage of another news site like Reuters embedded inside itself](http://news.yahoo.com/thousands-protesters-expected-washington-nyc-over-police-killings-110531287.html), without any button (as far as I can tell) to just link back to the original source. \n\nEven most news sites that will all jump on the same story will usually have their journalists write their own summation articles and just link to their sources in the text, which feels somewhat like plagiarism but I understand that news aggregates through being told and retold, and as long as the article is written originally that seems fine. This, however, just feels like stealing seeing as the websites for these articles are literally just wrapped inside of Yahoo's.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
