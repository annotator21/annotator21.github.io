And by forced, I mean he was much stronger than me and held a chef's knife to my throat. After the aforementioned actions, I was told he would kill me and my family if I told anyone. I was also molested a separate time by another \"friend\" (again, same age) around the same timeframe.\n\nI've never had any problems with what happened. Certainly, I was pissed off, but it never came with the emotional trauma that so many people experience afterward. I honestly hated every second of it, but I can openly talk about it (though I'm careful with my audience) and I have no problems with sex or trust. I've never told anyone, the exception being my current girlfriend, who first told me her molestation stories (see below).\n\nMy girlfriend was molested by two men (both older than her, she was 7 and 11? years old at the times; both incidents involved attempted penetration) and has had a few minor problems with sex, but not anything she hasn't been able to cope with, and since meeting me, things have gotten much better in that department. In fact, these problems now cease to exist. I can say with certainty she is not hiding anything from me.\n\nSo, reddit, what gives? I've always likened it to something like getting mugged on the street or having the shit beaten out of you, but you've completely healed physically since then\u2014it happened. That's it. After that, I feel like it's all in your head.\n\nI am NOT saying that sexual crimes are in any way excusable. Victims should seek help and perpetrators should be punished accordingly. However, I am saying that the emphasis people place on a physically harmless experience is a bit extreme. And, once again, I am referring to sexual crimes in which physical damage is minimal or healable, NOT cases in which the victim is even semi-permanently disfigured or is given a disease.\n\nPerhaps I'm just a unicorn; I don't know. But, my experiences tell me that you can definitely get over it. I mean, you were roofied and sodomized against your own will. But is there any lasting physical problem? Is anything outside of your own head different now? Grieving about it isn't going to help anyone. Move on, you have better things to do in your life. It may take a bit to get over, but there isn't any reason you should carry an experience like this on your back for years or even decades. That behavior strikes me as emotional weakness.\n\nSo, reddit, change my view!\n\n**Edit**: Some people have brought to my attention that I should not be belittling others for coping with their traumatic experiences differently that me. As such, my view has definitely changed in that area. I think victims should be given as much of the proper care they need, and no less. There is no sense in shaming victims for something that happened to them.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Therefore, such a being cannot exist.\"\n\nThis is a very weak argument. It's entirely possible that you just don't know enough to understand how such a thing could be true. You could have used the same argument 500 years ago to disprove the internet, or modern chemistry, because you would have been very ignorant of the science required to make those things happen. In fact, it's currently the same argument creationists effectively use when they argue against evolution: they don't understand how it works, so of course it can't be true. \n\nThe intuition you have, I believe, is just that the idea of God is so far-fetched and outside of everyday experience that it seems unlikely to be true. This is fine, and I share it. But if wanted to determine whether such a being did exist, I certainly wouldn't expect it to have the same physical qualities that we do. The relevant question is whether or not there is any evidence to suggest such a being exists. Its actual properties aren't really that important, unless they're self-contradictory.

Christianity? Omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence may certainly be common attributes in many religions, but they're hardly required to consider something a God. Consider most forms of polytheism in which there are *many* gods, each in control of specific aspects of the world, and *none* who possess omniscience, omnipotence, or omnipresence. Or consider pantheism, in which god *is* the universe, and is not a distinct entity separate from it, in which case those attributes may be unnecessary (are you omnipotent, or omniscient in regards to the goings on of your own body? I'm sure not).\n\nWhat's more, you're suggesting it's impossible because it's not been seen yet. By that logic, non-carbon based life is impossible. Faster than light travel is impossible. Prior to recent history, going to space was impossible as well, I guess.\n\nAllow me to present to you a hypothetical scenario: say one day our technology progresses to such a point where it becomes possible to create a perfectly accurate simulation of a universe. In such a scenario, wouldn't the creator of this simulation be the \"god\" of that universe? Omniscience wouldn't be required to do so (after all, we sure don't know every possible thing that could occur in most programs we *currently* create). While their presence would be much larger than any sentience inside the simulation, it's unlikely the creator would be omnipresent either, since they'd still be bound by their own biological limitations. Omnipotence would be the only thing that may apply, as the creator could modify the simulation in any way they desire. Yet even this would only be in theory, since their lack of omniscience would logically result in unintended consequences of exerting such power.\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting the above scenario is the truth for *our* universe, but if you agree that such a scenario is possible, and such a creator could reasonably be deemed a god by those within the simulation, then you must agree that omnipotence  and omnipresence at least are not required for a god to exist."}, {"id": "2oodah", "body": "God is supposedly all-knowing, all-present, and all-powerful yet there are no organisms on earth that display physiological capacities to do the things that God can do.  \n\nAll-knowing:  In order for something to be all-knowing, it must possess the physical brain capacity for constant updates on EVERYTHING in the world.

Might blow your mind, but there's the grand jury trial, to see if there's even enough evidence to have a serious case, and then there's the ACTUAL trial.\n\nEvidence related to the grand jury trial that actually occurred was released. It is accessible over the internet in a simple Google search. \n\nHere are the facts:\n\n1) While Wilson did not know for a fact that Brown specifically was related to the robbery, he was aware of the general description of the someone who had robbed a store. Most robbers don't leave names and pictures - Brown matched a rough physical description.\n\n2) Brown was actively engaged in a crime when he was stopped. Sure, jaywalking ain't much of a crime, but it's still the police's job to make sure all laws are upheld, not just the ones against murder and robbery.\n\n3) Brown was found to have been on marijuana at the time of death. That'll often cause false courage/bravado, a feeling invulnerability, aggression, etc - all behaviors that Wilson noted Brown of exhibiting **before** he was aware that Brown was under the influence. Moreover, marijuana will influence clear thought and judgement. \n\nThese are all undisputed facts in the case. Based on this, I don't have a hard time believing that \n\na) Wilson had reasonable cause to stop Brown;\n\nb) Brown acted aggressively; and\n\nc) Wilson felt threatened enough to need to draw a gun.\n\nAfter this, I'm not and can't be sure of what happened - I wasn't there, and secondhand stories aren't reliable, especially when a bunch of different people say a bunch of different things - some say he surrendered immediately, some say he was a little rough at first before surrendering, some say he never surrendered. The human mind is nothing if not fallible. \n\nYou don't need a full, open court trial. We have plenty of presented evidence as is. Would I have preferred it actually did go to trial? Hell yes, I think there are quite a few unanswered questions that should be answered. But considering the facts, any halfway decent lawyer would be able to show, without bias of racism, that Wilson could have had just cause to pull a gun, regardless of whether the person he was stopping was white, black, Hispanic, Asian, or otherwise.\n\nWere some things in the story mixed up, told differently, out of order, remembered differently? Yes. However, there are hard facts. It may be possible that Wilson was more willing to shoot because Brown was black, I'm not denying it. But I think there's reasonable evidence that pulling a gun in such a situation is perfectly natural."}, {"id": "cmozi1p", "body": "I'm white. That's important for this argument.\n\nIf I knock over a store after violently assaulting the clerk, and talk like a thug to the cops and then bullrush a cop and he shoots me -- I don't think for a minute I don't deserve to be shot. I don't see a lack of morality there. I was violent in that moment, I was known to be violent previously, and I got shot. I die.\n\nI feel differently about the guy that got choked out. That bugs me. \n\nOn the other hand, though, I used to live in a city with a lot of hard-up white boys that knocked over stores, waved guns or fists around and they got shot.

However, given the standard of evidence and data we presently have, we should be wary of drawing necessary connections between the two.\n\nGiven that we've seen the grand jury testimony in the case of Michael Brown, we can see that we have a prosecutor which showed a clear bias in favor of the defendant and was basically incompetent at correctly performing his duties at the grand jury (including having given support to the defendant before the case). Legal experts have concluded this and agreed with it. So basically, we're looking at either racism or just plain police bias immediately by the fact that this didn't go to trial.\n\nThen we can look at the fact that Darren Wilson was put on paid administrative leave (which is very common when there is a black victim) as opposed to the case of most times when the victim of police misconduct is white, the officer in question is immediately reprimanded, loses their badge, or otherwise suffers a much harsher punishment than simply paid administrative leave. This suggests a racial component.\n\nThen we can look at the difference in media coverage between the portrayal of Michael Brown (and other black kids who are killed) versus when the victims are white and we can see that as per usual, Brown was immediately labelled a thug, \"no angel\", and all other kinds of alluding statements (especially considering that Wilson stopping him had *absolutely nothing to do with the cigars and he didn't even suspect Brown at the time of doing it, he only stopped them for jaywalking in the middle of the street*).

The Vedas describe a struggle against a foreign \"dark\" enemy, and their skin is dark, and there's a very distinct tie between 'darkness' and evil. The word describing the dehumanized enemy actually means 'the darks', so to speak.\n\nHistorically this period is tied with the Aryan movement into northern India, and it's likely that the Vedic image of 'dark skin' as a marker of evil originated from frequent conflict with the darker-skinned peoples who made up Harappan Indian society to the south.\n\nBut it hasn't always been that way around the world; there are examples of light-skinned people being discriminated against. Whatever form of racism develops though, it's almost always *initially* based on a need for community solidarity or economic imperative.\n\nSo what do China, Africa, and India have in common? A relatively recent history of colonialism by European powers, the result of which was that having lighter skin made it easier to blend in with, and be seen as one of, the occupying powers, which provided a better chance of achieving wealth and influence.\n\nIt's hardly surprising in that context, that racism would take on similar forms in those countries, but racism in the US has always been different because the initial division between white and black-skinned people was extremely clear-cut, as was the divide in economic and political status. This isn't just something that developed within the context of our culture, it was present from the beginning, and persisted in the foundations of our country's legal structure throughout almost all of our history."}, {"id": "2oo52p", "body": "As I'm sure you're all aware, there's been a number of mass demonstrations in protest against the racist policy of the US administration which have lasted for several consecutive months since a white policeman's recent killing of a black young man.\n\nThese demonstrations are an eruption of the pent-up anger of broad masses of people at the deep-rooted racial discrimination in American society.

Ferguson is definitely not an isolated incident. Things like this happen all too frequently and it is a disgrace.\n\nI may just have a problem with the phrasing of this, but I'd object to calling what happened a \"racist policy,\" even though the effects are sadly very discriminatory. I don't seriously believe that anyone involved had the intention of intimidating or oppressing black citizens or giving white people in positions of authority preferential treatment, although that is the effect of the policy.\n\nIn the early-to-mid 20th century lynch mobs who killed black citizens they believed had disrespected the social order routinely escaped justice for their crimes. Juries refused to convict them for murder. This is what it looks like when the law is deliberately ignored for racist motives.\n\nThat's not exactly how it works now. While many police officers are not being indicted for killing black citizens in a professionally negligent and probably subconsciously discriminatory manner, I have no doubt that it wasn't in the intentions of these policemen to kill anyone for reasons other than self-defense.

You said \"Given that slaves were literally not legally considered people in the same sense as free men, slavery meant being buried below the fucking totem pole.\"  But remember that \"free men\" is a bit of a misnomer.  Europe was very hierarchal then.  Many \"free men\" were indentured servants, some subject to physical abuse.  And most \"free men\" couldn't vote (you had to be a landowner at a minimum), own land, and do a whole bunch of other stuff.

Just like you don't willingly take a sledgehammer to your car even though you \"own it\".  And that's because you need that car.  Now, I know you are gasping for air because I just compared a person to a car, but I'm not saying that it's OK to do that.  I'm just trying to say to emphasize one of my original points that slavery was economic, and it was not in a slaveholder's interest to lose a slave.  Now, I'm not saying that such tragedies didn't happened, obviously they did, and it was a major part of what makes slavery abhorrent, but I'd need to do a little more research to determine if it was the norm or even a high minority of the time.

I feel like I am talking about it fairly objectively, it's most other people that are looking at with their year 2014 Starbucks mocha latte righteous indignation.

Again, slavery was economic.  All that really happened was an \"advanced society\" took over a \"less advanced\" society.  It doesn't matter if they were black, white, blue or green.  And I'm not saying we should do stuff like that today, but back then, many cultures straight up euthanized and killed other civilizations.  In a sense, you have to admit that slavery, while bad, was not as out of place at that time period like it would be today.  I mean, if so, find me another culture at that time that was roses and equality (don't say Africa, don't say south America, and I don't know as much about it, but you probably shouldn't say china).  \n\nIn sum, I am glad we have progressed so much today.

The present conditions of the black in America are miserable due to the discriminating, racist policy; in spite of all our civil rights legislation, minority citizens still fall victim to the crimes and to the prejudice of the judicial authorities in America.\n\nIt is almost impossible for minority citizens in America to get jobs and even if they manage to be employed, they are subject to discriminating treatment though they toil and moil.

A good friend of mine once lost his job because his employers discovered he was gay, but because he couldn't prove that it was because he was gay. It wasn't a low-end job either, and he was doing well in it. He hasn't been able to find a job on anywhere near the same level since then. My county's fire department has hired one female firefighter. Ever. She was moved to desk work a few months later. There are 2 female firefighters in my county currently; both of them were men when they were hired. *There are more male-to-female transgendered persons than there are hired-as-women women in my county's fire department.* I was out one night and I saw a guy looking through trash cans and asking people for money. He wasn't being particularly aggressive or anything, and it was cold out, and I could tell he was tired as fuck.\n\nI was waiting outside a bar for someone at night, and a situation started to develop; a policeman came over and started yelling at the guy. I wanted to ask what he even did wrong, but I figured it was probably better to not get involved. Now I kind of wish I had at least asked, because the guy clearly just wanted to be left alone, but the policeman just kept yelling at him louder, and eventually the guy was just cowering on the sidewalk while this police officer yelled at him. There was no outright violence, but it was clear that this officer was just venting his anger on this guy because he could. People were crossing the street to avoid the scene.\n\nAnd I'm just standing there thinking \"Jesus, what did the guy do? This isn't how the law works; if he's breaking the law that severely, arrest him. If he didn't, leave him the fuck alone.\"\n\nI've seen other occasions where black homeless men were accosted and harassed by the police, but there's white homeless people all over that street too, and I've never seen the police even begin to approach any of them even when they were being aggressive and I would have appreciated police intervention.\n\nNo, I've never seen any unarmed people get shot, and I've never seen anyone 'not get hired', on the basis of race, but I've also actually never been in charge of hiring, so there's that too.

I see D and R (democrats and republics, I will just shorten them to D and R) continuously arguing over topics that would not benefit the general public. Their reasons are often objectionable, and I do not see why we continue to use this party system. I do understand that it would be an absolutely HUGE undertaking to redo this system and I am not advocating for an immediate change. \n\nFor example: net neutrality. What the hell is going on here? From what I understand, we have ISP corporations paying government officials to pass laws or the such to benefit the ISP. (That, of which, is an entirely different discussion) So now we effectively have the ISPs vs the ones who didn't accept the money. What on earth? We didn't elect the ISPs. We elected representatives... People who are supposed to stand for the general public, not a couple corporations. Additionally - we all know Obama is pro neutrality. I have no opinion on Obama or his work. Maybe I will after he finishes this term. But I see people opposing net neutrality SOLELY because Obama is for it. What? You're willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesn't want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument, its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ? How can voters trust your party if you just go against another persons beliefs just because of who they are? \n\nIf this whole ordeal repeatedly continues into other issues that we face in the future, what does this mean for the citizens? It would effectively be run by whoever has more people in power, and those people have a chance of being run by money sent to them by corporations. \n\nAdditionally, I often see that we are left with the choice of \"dumb vs dumber\" in elections.

How do you protect the freedom of everyone (and importantly the equal treatment of everyone which leads to freedom).\n\n* How do you write laws? This is a classic computation problem (computer scientist here). Our current way of writing laws is inherently serial, there is no easy way to make it parallel for 300 million people to write a law at once. An easy solution would be to still have representatives to write laws, but have the people vote on them, but that too has the potential for abuse.\n\n* How do you conduct hearings? One of the powers of the legislative branch is to oversee the judicial and executive branches to make sure they are doing their jobs (correctly). Again an easy solution would be to elect representatives to conduct hearings on the behalf of the people.\n\nEventually you get back to just using representatives again.

I see D and R (democrats and republics, I will just shorten them to D and R) continuously arguing over topics that would not benefit the general public. Their reasons are often objectionable, and I do not see why we continue to use this party system. I do understand that it would be an absolutely HUGE undertaking to redo this system and I am not advocating for an immediate change. \n\nFor example: net neutrality. What the hell is going on here? From what I understand, we have ISP corporations paying government officials to pass laws or the such to benefit the ISP. (That, of which, is an entirely different discussion) So now we effectively have the ISPs vs the ones who didn't accept the money. What on earth? We didn't elect the ISPs. We elected representatives... People who are supposed to stand for the general public, not a couple corporations. Additionally - we all know Obama is pro neutrality. I have no opinion on Obama or his work. Maybe I will after he finishes this term. But I see people opposing net neutrality SOLELY because Obama is for it. What? You're willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesn't want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument, its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ? How can voters trust your party if you just go against another persons beliefs just because of who they are? \n\nIf this whole ordeal repeatedly continues into other issues that we face in the future, what does this mean for the citizens? It would effectively be run by whoever has more people in power, and those people have a chance of being run by money sent to them by corporations. \n\nAdditionally, I often see that we are left with the choice of \"dumb vs dumber\" in elections. Why are the parties in charge of who represents them? Can't we eliminate the parties and each candidate stands by his own beliefs, not the party's , and then we can elect someone the majority agrees with?\n\nCMV.

The fact of the matter is, parties back then were also ideologically based. The federalists and democratic-republicans had CLEAR differences in ideology, epitomized in the differences between the presidencies of Adams and Jefferson.\n\nAnd claiming that all the problems lie with a presidential form of government makes little to no sense. While it's true that both president and congress are voted upon and earned, when the shit hits the fan, people don't sit around claiming to be \"in the right\" forever - they get stuff done given enough time.

Government shutdowns are just games of chicken between people who may or may not be extremists that have taken party leadership and won't back down and the other side (who ALSO may or may not be extremists depending on your definition).\n\nMoreover, as noted by the (fear-mongering, I might add) article, there are clear and noticeable differences between America, and every presidential system that's failed.

It appears to be a very flawed system to me.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, in the end, politics is a process of channeling millions of diverse views into a single sovereign will.   \n\nRepresentative democracy, in particular, channels millions of individual stances into a few hundred representatives under a handful of platforms. \n\nPolitical scientists are well aware of the techniques for having a few more than two parties, through proportional elections with party list representatives, or with preference voting, but they are also aware of the fact that both party systems can be comparably valid ways of organizing politics. \n\nWhen ultimately you need to be governed by one leader, a many-party parliament might give the illusion of choice, while giving way to shady backroom politicking. You feel safe to vote for a Green Party that has 6% of the seats, knowing that your vote strenghtens them anyways, but ultimately the Greens will have to form a coalition with a bunch of other similarly small parties to have a governing majority. Who leads the majority, is decided by backroom deals, secret compromises, and personal interests of the many party leaders, and when the whole thing falls apart a few months later, there is no particular party to blame. \n\nAlso, proportional representation gives way to more radical parties that can gain a foothold in a time of crisis. \n\nThere is a reason why the U.S. survived with only one civil war through more than 200 years, while Europe went through waves of revolutions. A two-party system is stable. There is an Us vs. Them mentality, but there is also a pull towards the center as fringe voters can't gain a foothold, so there is a consensus-driven attitude that might feel suffocating for a young radical, but it also keeps thing working on the long term. \n\nInstead of letting many petty ideologies represent themselves under different party flags, the two party system channels them into permanent coalitions with more identifiable leaders and responsibilities, and leaves the primaries to decide which faction of the parties gains prominence in a given election. In a way it's more democratic. \n\nEven if an individual libertarian, or green, or whatever can't get a party of their own, at least they can decide which of two more streamlined options to support as leader, instead of hoping that the tiny party that they elected will bet on the good coalition leader in parliament, and bargain for the right policy supports.

The anti-Obama coalition within Congress and the media is really just the disadvantaged side in the current political climate trying to gain leverage against the majority; it's an intellectually dishonest strategy, but a concise strategy nonetheless.\n\nThis goes, somewhat, with what the Founders meant by \"the tyranny of the majority\". Just as a nation should not be unilaterally ruled by a king, it should also not be ruled by a simple majority of people. The solution they proposed was that every major policy be a compromise, where neither side really gets what they want. But when we're not left with the situation where someone can be considered three-fifths of a person, our simple-majority election system sometimes results in one side getting everything they want while the other 49% don't get anything, and that can breed a lot of hatred and frustration in people."}, {"id": "cmp1d0q", "body": "\u2206\n\nFair points.

I see D and R (democrats and republics, I will just shorten them to D and R) continuously arguing over topics that would not benefit the general public. Their reasons are often objectionable, and I do not see why we continue to use this party system. I do understand that it would be an absolutely HUGE undertaking to redo this system and I am not advocating for an immediate change. \n\nFor example: net neutrality. What the hell is going on here? From what I understand, we have ISP corporations paying government officials to pass laws or the such to benefit the ISP. (That, of which, is an entirely different discussion) So now we effectively have the ISPs vs the ones who didn't accept the money. What on earth? We didn't elect the ISPs. We elected representatives... People who are supposed to stand for the general public, not a couple corporations. Additionally - we all know Obama is pro neutrality. I have no opinion on Obama or his work. Maybe I will after he finishes this term. But I see people opposing net neutrality SOLELY because Obama is for it. What? You're willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesn't want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument, its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ? How can voters trust your party if you just go against another persons beliefs just because of who they are? \n\nIf this whole ordeal repeatedly continues into other issues that we face in the future, what does this mean for the citizens? It would effectively be run by whoever has more people in power, and those people have a chance of being run by money sent to them by corporations. \n\nAdditionally, I often see that we are left with the choice of \"dumb vs dumber\" in elections. Why are the parties in charge of who represents them? Can't we eliminate the parties and each candidate stands by his own beliefs, not the party's , and then we can elect someone the majority agrees with?\n\nCMV.

I'm not going to insult you by diminishing your argument to \"you're ok with crimes against humanity\" but foreign policy is a very murky and gray field, and taking the stance of 'we shouldn't get involved, ever' IS glossing over TONS of good that the American military can and has done in the world. The same can be said of Libya. We got involved, as minimally as possible, at the specific time we did to prevent a wholesale slaughter of civilians in Benghazi. Of course, Libya has fallen apart since then, but it was never in the scope of the mission to build a state there, and it shouldn't have been, as Iraq has taught us. As for the people who say Obama's involvement in Libya is evidence that he's the same as a Republican, look at what Republicans wanted him to do during that time period: invade. With thousands of troops. Costing more blood and treasure.

This is most evident in the fact that the federal government isn't challenging the rulings in the states where MM has passed. Under a republican, those WERE contested. Plus, the proof is in the pudding: both medical and recreational marijuana is on a roll in this country at the state level, which is exactly where the change is going to come from. Don't get me wrong, I'm disappointed that Obama hasn't done more to PROMOTE legalization or decriminalization, but this issue doesn't exist in a vacuum, so one can not say that a republican would do exact what he has, which is to lessen the role the federal government has in it.

The other side is that the government should be able to indefinitely detain citizens whenever they want.

Again, leaving Patriot Act in place is actually the centrist position on the issue. Here's a little thought exercise for you: Obama initially ran on promising to do away with the patriot act. Then he got in to office and changed his mind and reauthorized it. Now, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and choose to believe that you aren't someone who believes in the New World Order or whatever, and don't think that Obama lied on purpose to get into office just so he could begin his nefarious plan. If I'm right about you, then the question is \"What changed Obama's mind?\" He knew he would face political consequences for reneging on a campaign promise and piss off his voter base, which is an irrational thing to do for anything other than a really good reason. What if he sat down in the Oval Office on day 1, received his national security briefing, and realized that the political cost of keeping the drag net surveillance programs in place was worth it given the threats to the American public? Are there ANY specific threats that you can think of which would warrant what the NSA has been doing? Because I can sure think of some. For example, what if Pakistan sold a pair of nuclear weapons to the Pakistani Taliban in 2007 and now we have no idea where they are. Would that be worth the loss of privacy to you, because let me tell you, that it an entirely possible thing to have happened. Now, I'm not saying that I just blanket trust the President on this issue, but I know for certain that he has a much better idea of realities of the threats out there than anyone on here does, and as a result refuse to believe that this issue is as cut and dry as many on this website, and Glenn Greenwald and Edward Snowden, make it out to be. \n\nI apologize, for brevities sake I wasn't clear enough on what I meant about third party voters being republicans.

If you don't believe that the government should have any role in say, education, or administrating the safety of food, or preserving national forests, of COURSE you're going to defund those things, and of COURSE you know that that's only going to make them less effective.

Perhaps not genocide, but Hussein's regime was definitely up to some human rights violating. The people of Iraq were by no means safe under him, and political murder was very common. Should he have sent troops in to stop this? Should Clinton have sent troops to Kosovo? I admit that I don't really know, but I personally belive the UN should be the force to act internationally, not the US. As a coalition of world governments, it looks a lot better to have the UN preventing genocide and toppling horrible dictatorships than the US, which makes it look like the US is nation building.\n\n&gt;As for your second point, the DEA has absolutely changed it's stance on marijauna since Obama has become president.

Neither is really advocating decriminalization, legalization, or fewer raids. I live in Michigan and have heard about plenty of raids to make me think that they have not decreased in the past 6 years. Perhaps a Republican president would have contested the states' decisions, but I'm inclined to think not, since the Republican party is traditionally pro-state's rights. Not with some issues, but I think legalization is one of those issues for most Republicans.\n\n&gt;Now, I'm not saying that I just blanket trust the President on this issue, but I know for certain that he has a much better idea of realities of the threats out there than anyone on here does, and as a result refuse to believe that this issue is as cut and dry as many on this website\n\nI agree. I don't actually know lots of things that happen, but I want to be able to trust my government to not throw rights out the window because faceless terrorism exists. And I'm not just talking about Obama here; my own senators and representative all voted in favor of the NDAA provision and that one internet-regulating bill a while ago (can't remember the name). These are issues that the Republicans and Democrats seem to agree on, but that I strongly disagree on. \n\n&gt;I'm not trying to say you are all secretly republicans now\n\nThat's good, and thanks for apologizing.\n\n&gt;That's on top of the fact that every time you vote for a third party candidate you hurt the one of the two main candidates that better align with your actual views and actually stand a chance of winning.\n\nWe're going to have to disagree here. I vote third party to send a message to the political leaders, namely that I am unsatisfied with the mainstream parties. I would just not vote, but I think voting third party sends a stronger message. Besides that, *I don't often agree with either candidate.* Very often I don't like either candidate at all. I didn't like Obama or Romney in 2012, so I didn't vote for them. Why would I? I truly believe that voting for someone you don't agree with is the only way to truly waste your vote.\n\nAs for your last paragraphs, that mentality is not conducive to getting anything done. If you view the \"others\" as stupid, out to get you, and sort of evil, then you'll never be able to take any other viewpoints seriously. \n\nA thing that many people don't seem to believe is that all politicians--everybody, really--is trying to do what's best. No one gets into politics and says, \"I'm going to make everyone's lives shitty.\" They do it because they genuinely believe they are doing the right thing. They may be misguided or plain wrong, but they are not actively trying to ruin the country or people's lives. This \"Us vs. Them\" shit makes the others out to be monsters, but that's not how it is. My father routinely talks about how liberals are plotting to destroy America in a way that's very reminiscent to the way you're talking about Republicans. Who's right? Maybe you are, maybe he is, maybe neither of you. The point is that it does no one any good to believe the worst in the other side, because that just makes you more open to propaganda from your own side, and also makes you more likely to have a view simply because it's in opposition to the other side's view rather than because it's the one you actually think is right."}, {"id": "cmp0x80", "body": "I generally vote third party because, in action and not ideology, I don't see a ton of difference between the two parties. \n\nJust as a few examples, Republicans are often seen as war-heavy, but the American military has been sent into foreign lands under every president since Reagan, including Clinton (Kosovo) and Obama (Libya). \n\nAlso, under a Democratic Congress and president, federal raids of medicinal marijuana farms in Michigan have not stopped.

Through [most of the 20th century](http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4842634/polar_housesenate_difference.png), the parties were not very well sorted ideologically, so there were often liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats who were able to find people like themselves in the other party and pass bipartisan initiatives. Now, that doesn't happen.\n\nThat means that supporters of one party are unlikely to see anyone in the other party who seems like themselves, which exacerbates the natural human tendency to see people as an \"in-group\" and \"out-group\", as psychologists call the \"us-vs-them\" way of thinking.

"}, {"id": "cmoz1u8", "body": "I don't think many people would disagree that the two party system doesn't represent the beliefs of most people in America. The main issue is how to change it.\n\nThe first step for this is figuring out what you want to change about the system. Do you want people to vote based on personal ideology instead of party? Most elections only have 1 to 3 candidates to choice from. You could say more politicians need to run, but that require a lot of time and money from people who have no shot at winning. To win most elections, a politician needs 50% of the vote to win. If you have more than 2 parties legitimately competing, this becomes very hard to do. If no one gets the majority, the election goes to a runoff between the top two choices. This means if there are two left leaning parties, and five right leaning parties, there is about a 100% chance the left will win. This systematic problem means it it more beneficial to have few parties you agree with and many that you don't.\nBecause of the above mentioned problems, it becomes clear that a legal change would be needed to fix the system. FPTP (first past the post) voting would need to be legally abolished by every local and state government in order to allow for third parties to become stronger. Now the question becomes what do you replace it with. Do we just scrap local elections in favor of a general proportional party election? That would be a tough sell, as most people at least like to feel that they are voting for a person, not a party. CGP Grey has several good videos about the topic that I will link to at the bottom of this reply. He suggests many different alternatives, but my favorite is STV (single transferable vote) which I'll let him explain. \n\nNow we have decided what we want to do to change the system, but we have no idea how to do it. The legislators in DC will almost certainly never amend the constitution to limit their own power, and the states are only slightly more likely to do it. The only way it is ever likely to happen is via ballot initiative which several states do not have. For federal level offices, such as the president, senate, and the house, state level initiatives may not be able to stand. The only way to change those elections is through an amendment, so you would need 75% of the states want to implement your proposal which would be very difficult because no one in power now would benefit from the change.\n\nMy basic point is this. While most people will likely agree that the current system is not good, there is basically no chance that it will ever change, because those in power want to stay in power.\n\nEdit: Forgot the link\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638"}, {"id": "2oo3qw", "body": "First, this is my first post to CMV, so I apologize if I do anything incorrectly. \n\nAs a young student recently gaining the ability to vote, I quite frankly have no idea what is going on in the modern political system.

Can't we eliminate the parties and each candidate stands by his own beliefs, not the party's , and then we can elect someone the majority agrees with?\n\nThe way the representation works is you get a group of people together and you choose someone to represent your group.  That person cannot represent everyone fully so each member of the group must make some compromise in order to end up on the winning side of the vote.  The larger the group of people the more compromise members are going to have to make, but the greater the power that representative has.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the amount of compromise you are willing to make is directly proportional to the amount of power you will wield.  We have 2 powerful political parties because voters have decided that they are willing to accept a great deal of compromise in exchange for a great deal of power.\n\nIf voters were willing to compromise less we'd have more parties, the parties would more closely align with the wishes of their constituents, but each party would be weaker.  The majority of voters have decided that they would rather trade their ideals for more power -- and they have it.  The 2 parties have power because they represent the (compromised) desires of huge swaths of people.  \n\nYou can choose not to participate in the 2 party system, but in doing so you are trading away power for the right to compromise less.  That's a valid strategy, but the outcome will be exactly what you expect when the vast majority of your fellow voters are willing to compromise more than you are.  \n\nThe dumb and dumber effect is also squarely the fault of the voters.  Voters have shown time and time again that they care more about who a politician has slept with or what a politician said in some out-of-context statement than they do about what the politician actually stands for or how they think.  As a result we get politicians who are good at being cautious and good at being politicians rather than getting politicians who are good at being legislators.  If we judged politicians on how good they are at legislating we would get legislators.

BRAC (the process by which the miltary decided to close military basis) is something that heavily affects the South.  \n\n* Neither: Today, national defense is something that doesn't really divide cleanly along partisan lines. Some politicians from both parties favor a non-interventionist approach to the middle east (e.g, get the hell out of Iraq and Afghnistan); likewise, there are politicians in both parties who favor an interventionlist approach (albeit there are a lot more Republican interventionlists than Democrats). Civil liberties is another issue where the lines aren't clearly drawn (Democrat Mark Udall and Republican Rand Paul are good on civil liberties; Barack Obama and George Bush are both horrible on it)\n\n\nNow, money tends to play an important role in this. Both parties have industries that support them - Democrats get money from trial lawyers, unions, hollywood, and technology companies. Republicans get money from rich people and corporate interests.

Slavery and women's suffrage have advanced massively since 200 years ago.  More recently since the early to mid 90's we're on a downward trend for crime.  Violent crime rates are about half what they were 2 decades ago.  We have more access to more information for more people than ever before in history.  We have more influence over our government than ever before.  Is everything perfect?  No.  Is there a bunch of blocking and general adversarial actions in politics?  Yes.  But we are influencing it.  We have a voice.  It may not be as big as we want it to be, but it is there.  Society has gotten better and the further back you go in history the more completely obvious the better becomes.  Change is a slow process and there will always be resistance but we are making progress.\n\nI think we could improve this with better voting systems.

"}, {"id": "cmpjn2q", "body": "There are a few benefits to having a two-party system, and it is not necessarily a bad thing that people align with their political parties. Further, although I won't be able to change your view on a small scale (there are people with an \"us vs. them\" mentality), I believe that I can make a quick argument against your view in general.\n\nA. The party system results in moderate views by balancing the \"extremes\"\n\nIt seems that the party system is extreme and flawed, but that is just perception based on a few sets of views.  If we had about ten parties running, you will often have extremest groups winning, and then they will keep winning, shutting down a large portion of the population (For example, when Teddy Roosevelt ran under the Bull Moose party, he caused the Republican party under Taft to lose votes, resulting in the Democrats winning under Wilson.  Had Roosevelt just let it go, a person with views much closer to his would have won).\n\nThe Republicans and Democrats switch places - as one gets too extreme, the public prefers the moderate positions of the other. When the Republican party first won with Lincoln, it was a very nationalist party.  Today, it is very states-rights oriented, whereas the Democrats are all about bigger federal power - you can see these flips - as one party keeps winning the federal government, it becomes more and more about big federal government, and the other party gradually switches its orientation to states-rights. As one side becomes too power hungry, or too extreme, it will be reigned in by the more moderate beliefs of its citizens.\n\nB. The Law is Slow - and it some ways, that is a good thing.\n\nThe Patriot Act was a hastily enacted law that probably resulted in the violation of more than a few civil liberties.  But at the time, it was widely supported. Why?  Because it was a reaction to a set of tragic events that stirred emotion and national pride.  It was enacted too hastily. Congress is very reactionary, but the best laws  are enacted with thought, compromise, and the support of both political parties. Now, we are stuck in this emergency state where the norm is a violation of civil rights without consent, and it will be hard to dig ourselves out.  I personally believe the same with the Affordable Care Act - Some politicians were so desperate to get this thing out in Obama's term that they didn't bother with truly identifying the problems of the current system and their causes and experimenting with possible solutions using existing state health systems.\n\nAlthough it will result in temporary injustices, for the good of the future public, laws that are enacted must be enacted with thought.\n \nC. Career Politicians\n\nOne of the biggest problems with our political system is that our politicians do what they do for a living. This has at least two effects: (1) They need votes - without them, they don't make a living, and (2) They need sponsors - without them, they don't get votes (you can't vote for a guy you've never heard of), and their career is worthless, and (3) they need to protect each other in order to stay in the game.  In order to stay strong, parties need to appear united.  These three effects lead to a corrupt political system that can only be saved by many things we don't have right now, such as perfect, unbiased sources of information, eradication of racism and prejudice, and a significantly better election system (a few are mentioned below, but realize that no system is perfect).\n\nHowever, it is skeptical to say that candidates sell out by aligning with their parties.  In some cases, of course this is true, and especially so for whatever sociopath is running for president. However, take the utilitarian view: It is humble to align your views with the party, even when you disagree on one or two points, because you understand that no one is always right, and the views of one individual may not outweigh the collective views of the group - it would be pretentious to act otherwise. \n\nD. At a micro-scale, you aren't wrong.\n\nThere are people out there who will refuse to vote for anyone but \"their\" party for the rest of their lives because...stupid.  My sister has literally said this to me (She is republican and did not like it when I voted for a moderate democrat).  I have a buddy who thinks that Republicans are greedy parasites on the political system who only got into politics to represent \"big business\" or evangelists.  Of course there are individuals who are opposed to net neutrality simply because Obama mentioned that he is for it.  We call these people idiots.  However, thinking that the only reason people may be against net neutrality is that Obama is for it is just as biased and unfair.\n\nHowever, at a macro-scale, including in Congress, this isn't true.  Everything is a matter of compromise, and Congress was designed to be slow - not necessarily for a two-party system, but for a system that would ensure that laws that could affect the entire nation are necessary. However, [lots](http://www.gayswithguns.net/) of political [groups](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/12/wonkbook-polling-shows-even-republicans-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/) represent the [views](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/1e103500d3d04da78b9117e5737a92fe/bishops-revise-document-gays-expect-approval) of both [parties](http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/), and it [is](http://www.democratsforlife.org/) rare that a politician will completely align with his party.\n\nAs for the net-neutrality issues, I do not think that you need to worry, because there is overwhelming support for it.  However, make sure that you look to the [actual](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshsteimle/2014/05/14/am-i-the-only-techie-against-net-neutrality/) arguments for or [against](http://mashable.com/2014/05/16/5-arguments-against-net-neutrality/) a cause you support before assuming that people who do not share your opinion simply think the way they do because they hate Obama.  The people against net neutrality aren't necessarily \"pro-corporate\" and \"anti-public.\"  Rather, they believe that the majority of citizens would benefit from a system that required entities to pay proportionally to their demand. This goes back to the big-government vs. free market concept - do you believe that your internet service would be better if it were heavily regulated or if it were the result of a purely competitive market?\n\n**Concluding Thoughts**\n\nReading back, I'm not sure I entirely answered your view because it seemed like you had a lot of different concerns that weren't entirely related.  I did not try to take any specific political positions in my argument, and it was not my intent to seem like I did.

"}, {"id": "cmpl7l3", "body": "I don't want to seem like an anarchosocialist. I am not. But the criticisms of the US political/economic systems and their interaction with mass media are strikingly logical. The real problem is the gutting of any sense of a liberal party. The Democratic Party no longer protects the middle class, workers' rights, etc etc. They sold out for corporate dollars. It's been happening for years. Bill Clinton sold out the middle class for campaign funding. Obama is a corporate figurehead. The liberal party serves as an outlet for discontent, and when they no longer represent the people, then our capitalist democracy moves more and more towards a totalitarian climate, with consolidation of power towards the top, which compounds upon itself.\n\nCongress is almost completely in the pocket of corporations, and that's not to say they are corrupt, but we've become a society where economics trumps policy.

Terrible and horrible and devastating, yes. Evil, not really. Evil acts have bad consequences.\n\nGoing from there, we reach the question of whether or not suicide is an evil act. I don't think so. It's a bad act, but I don't think there's actual malice in it (in most cases). I think people who actually go through with it, don't do so to hurt others, but to stop their own pain. And this is their only, final option. \n\nI think these people know they will hurt those who love them, but that knowledge often isn't enough to stop them. So, if they know they'll hurt others and still go through with it, does that make them (and the act) evil? Debatable. How clearly is a person about to commit suicide thinking? Let's not forget all the people who simply don't see the love their families and friends have for them. The, \"No one will miss me anyway,\" mentality. \n\nLet's also not forget that many suicidal people feel out of control in their lives and this is one of those few things where they can take that control back, make a decision and act. In a world that seems to be set against them, filled with people who don't care, I don't think them not caring too much about the impact on other people is evil.

The District Court judge thought that the movie had no purpose other than to discredit Clinton's candidacy for president.  \n\nI haven't seen the film, but for the sake of argument I am willing to stipulate that ads for the film would look the same as the normal political attack ads we see every election cycle.  (I think the film was designed for this purpose)\n\nSo allowing films like that and ads for it, in effect, allows for unlimited political spending.\n\nCompare that film to Fahrenheit 9/11.  Citizens United had sued to have Fahrenheit 9/11 found to violate campaign finance laws, but the film was found to represented bona fide commercial activity, and thus not be covered by such laws.\n\nWhere do we draw the line?  I could put together a movie with actual plot and themes and stuff taking place for an hour, and the other half hour is material to cut attack ads out of.  I could then run ads for the film which were, in effect, political attack ads.  That film would be bona fide commercial activity, but still be exploitable in the same way.\n\nIf we don't allow unlimited political spending, I can't picture a rule that would work.  For a number of reasons I don't like the impact of unlimited political spending so please Change My View!\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
