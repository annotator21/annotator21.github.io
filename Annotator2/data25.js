The North American-based NFL, MLB, and NBA have a near monopoly on talent at the highest-level for many years, has been virtually been ingrained in the American culture, have its marketing concentrated to Americans about a century, and give people exposure since they were kids. Contrast that with the MLS, who has only been here for about 20 years and, while slowly increasing in quality, simply doesn't produce the best the sport has to offer. Plus, the exposure of the highest-caliber soccer that was oversees since its inception in the early 20th century has only begun to make its way into the USA a la globalisation.\n\nYes, Americans have been exposed to the World Cup for a while, but I would argue that club teams produces higher-quality soccer. Teams that do training with a group for months continuously, occasionally done together since they were teenagers, produces better quality entertainment than a team of compatriots with maybe two sparsely-scattered months of training each year, no matter which sport is being played. Seeing the top-division team in the Spanish, English, Italian, and German League fight it out for champions, top 4, and getting out of relegation produces great drama and thrills, as well as gets the best out of the sport. Also, part of the joy of watching European soccer is that you get to see Legendary teams, such as Sacchi's Milan, Fergie's class of 92, Wenger's Invincibles, Barcelona's La Masia (grrrrrr), or Bayern's treble of 2013 all rely on a superb combination of technique and teamwork to battle against some tough opposition, truly makes a great spectacle.\n\nI don't doubt that the NBA, MLB, and the NFL also offers this. But, I also don't believe Americans have been exposed to this level of soccer yet, to the same degree and time they have been exposed to the other sports they are used to. \n\nIf the soccer has the opportunity to show top-quality for many years, and still the US has the MLB, NFL, and NBA as the top sport, then I concede there could be a legitimate argument that soccer is less \"entertaining\" than them. As of now, I'm not convinced the soccer has had a fair chance to showcase its best to the US."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2ozdb7", "body": "**EDIT**: View Changed by /u/NeilZod\n&gt;Why do you believe that a civil suit will result in criminal charges? If the statute of limitations for rape has already passed, then Cosby can't be charged with rape.\n\n\u2206\nI began this saying I was unaware of the specifics of the whole affair because I don't keep up with celebrity gossip. From all the attention it has garnered I was unaware that there was not a criminal case in progress, nor that the accusations are so old and past the statutes of limitation. That makes this much different because she's no longer someone trying to get double jeopardy with a civil case following a criminal case, but rather someone in the middle of media barrage. I still feel that should she have done this in the context of a criminal case it would have been wrong, but clearly the context of this case is much different than what I had been lead to believe.\n_____\n*As a preface, I'm not someone who usually cares much about celebrity or their scandals. For all I care, they're just more fallible people doing what they will. I've been vaguely aware of the controversy as a bunch of women are accusing Bill Cosby of rape under dubious circumstances, I think anyone who spends any significant amount of time would have to have at least heard of it, but I do not know the specific details. This is not a case for Cosby's guilt or innocence, I really could not care less about it, this is about the newest suit.*\n_____\nI overheard this being discussed briefly on the radio this morning, and the implications of Cosby's latest lawsuit are deeply disturbing to me. I went and found an [article about it](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/bill-cosby-faces-defamation-lawsuit-755791?utm_source=twitter) but for those who don't know, apparently the latest in the Bill Cosby rape scandal is a lawsuit for defamation of character. Basically, one of the women who has accused him of sexual assault is now trying to sue him for discrediting her accusations; for calling her a liar. \n\nTo me, this is a very dangerous case. I do not know the details regarding Cosby's guilt and I do not care to make a debate for or against him, this is a moot point. However, the implications of the lawsuit being pressed against him scare me. If someone accuses a person of something as serious as rape, that person's life is now turned upside. Regardless of guilt or innocence, their public image will be destroyed because their name will now be forever associated with sex crime. That this person can then be sued for defending themselves seems to be an abuse of the law.\n\nAs a man, it feels like there's no winning. There's a lot of radical feminist culture online which seems to suggest this idea that there is a pervasive rape culture and universal hatred towards women; a culture which paints the male image as a potential rapist waiting to strike. If this woman is successful in her defamation suit, it feels like no matter what men would be hopeless. If you're accused of rape, regardless of the facts you're guilty. If you try to defend your image or discredit the accuser's claims, you're guilty. Lose-Lose. \n\nWhat part of this is alright? In what way can this suit be justified?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Sure, the burden of proof in a civil case is lower than that of a criminal case, but she still needs to demonstrate to a reasonable extent that Bill Cosby raped her in order for her claim of defamation of character to hold water, even then she would probably have to demonstrate how being called a liar has adversely affected her life in order to receive compensation. Whether or not he raped this woman, this looks like an uphill lawsuit, especially considering that Bill could probably afford a good lawyer.\n\nThere's a lot of baggage in using Bill Cosby to highlight this issue you're arguing because in many people's minds and personal logic, the sheer number of accusations that he's had leveled against him make it difficult to believe that he didn't rape even one of them. So while logically it doesn't take away from the content of your argument, in many people's minds, if you try to use Bill Cosby as a martyr for this issue, you'll be seen as someone who can't see a wooden door right in front of you. So I'd argue that if she wins her case, the implications are not going to be as significant as you think they will be. If the case ends in her favor, then she argued well enough to demonstrate that her reputation was damaged by Bill's claims that she was a liar and that those claims were false; that's just the legal system working its \"magic.\" And if hypothetically most people believe that Bill raped at least one of his accusers or that the nature and or number of the rape accusations damage his credibility to point where people are ambivalent about supporting him, then there will be few people who would be disturbed by a ruling in favor of the plaintiff."}, {"id": "2ozdb7", "body": "**EDIT**: View Changed by /u/NeilZod\n&gt;Why do you believe that a civil suit will result in criminal charges?

It's not the feminists who paint this picture (disclaimer: I'm not talking about radicals here). It's the patriarchal view of men as hunters and conquerors that has led to the whole idea that a man can't keep it in his pants if he sees a hot girl walk by on the street. Men are predominantly the ones shifting blame and using the excuse of, \"she wore a short dress, she drank, she was alone, it was late...\" Meaning, men themselves paint themselves in this light.

This is not about feminism or men, it's about a man that potentially raped and abused numerous women for decades. \n\nIt's not that dangerous, tho. People get sued and win their cases every day. Just because someone sued you, doesn't mean you are automatically going down for it. And again, if he is guilty here - if he knew she was telling the truth and called her a liar - well yeah, she has grounds for a lawsuit. Where it will go is another question, but she is well within her rights. And if a woman accused you of raping her and you know you didn't do it, you could sue her in the same way.

It comes across as people thinking that piracy is justified because big studios charge too much money for their goods.\n\nI understand that Piracy can force the market to adapt in order to lower prices or allow for easier access, and this leads to the birth of Steam or Netflix. What I don't understand are the people that hold it as some sort of right to have access to anything and everything at no charge simply because they have an internet connection.\n\nThere is no situation where I would illegally download a move that was just released in theaters (or before it was released). That is flat out stealing, and harms the industry as a whole. There is also no situation where I would pirate a recently released game for the same reason.\n\nFurther, the argument of \"They don't deserve my money\" that people always throw around concerning the likes of Ubisoft or EA is an incredibly idiotic argument to justify piracy. If there is a product by a company you want to consume then purchase it. I don't agree with the human rights violations that happen in China or Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean I'm justified to steal the products produced there in lieu of boycotting them.\n\nI feel like I should add as an addendum that there is one situation where I have thought it was justified to pirate a movie, and would have if I had been able to. My father was bedridden while fighting Lung Cancer and wanted to see the second Hobbit.

Some people in this thread said things like \"if potential profit is a thing then why doesn't Pepsi sue Coke?\".  That analogy is totally false because when you pirate a game or music, you aren't competing with a company, you're getting a company's product for free.  In my opinion, as a creator, I'd much rather you not enjoy the spoils of my labor if you can't give me what I want for it.  Art is my job, and I deserve to get paid for it, just like every other form of labor.\n\nAnd as for \n&gt;If you already own the content. The content that you legally buy often comes with a lot of unnecessary restrictions. What if you own the DVD but have to sit through half an hour of commercials every time you want to watch it? Whats wrong with paying the producer and then just being able to watch the content conveniently? What if all the music you paid for on itunes somehow gets erased? Should you have to pay for all the content you already purchased a second time?\n\nThis argument just basically says that you don't care about the terms and agreements that you agree to when you purchase any form of media.  If you don't want to watch the trailers and commercials, then I'm sorry, take that up with the content creators that licensed their rights out to a distributer that uses commercials.  \n\nIt's not your place to decide how content is distributed, its the creator's or whomever the creator okay's to do it.  If I record a song and decide I never want anyone to hear it, but someone manages to make a torrent for the file, now what I wanted is out the window.  Me not wanting it heard is the same as me charging a dollar for it.  It's what I want.  If you choose to circumvent that, you're breaking the agreement we had.  "}, {"id": "cmu52g8", "body": "To your first point: I don't really think the coke analogy applies to what I said. Besides that, I guess its just a matter of personal opinion. There's a big difference between choosing to pirate to get content and having no other option. There is essentially no harm (or effect at all) on the artist if a consumer pirates content in a place where they can't buy it legally anyway; the only effect (which is positive) is that the consumer gets to enjoy something that was created to be enjoyed. It seems that if the artist has a problem, its with the laws restricting their content's sale, not the consumer.\n\nTo your second point: Once again, I guess its a question of your own opinion. You can say \"tough shit, you bought the dvd so deal with what's on it\" and thats fine. But someone else could say \"tough shit, I don't get access worth what I pay for the dvd anyway, why buy it at all?\" I understand that artists should have some say in how their content is sold but I don't agree that, after the sale, they have total authority over how and when a consumer is to view that content.\n\nThird: That last part is a completely different issue. Maybe I'm being too specific for the CMV, but I'only meant to discuss content that is already widely available for sale but restricted in certain places. "}, {"id": "2oz233", "body": "The most upvoted comments concerning Pirate Bay always hold it to some impossible level of importance. It comes across as people thinking that piracy is justified because big studios charge too much money for their goods.\n\nI understand that Piracy can force the market to adapt in order to lower prices or allow for easier access, and this leads to the birth of Steam or Netflix. What I don't understand are the people that hold it as some sort of right to have access to anything and everything at no charge simply because they have an internet connection.\n\nThere is no situation where I would illegally download a move that was just released in theaters (or before it was released). That is flat out stealing, and harms the industry as a whole. There is also no situation where I would pirate a recently released game for the same reason.\n\nFurther, the argument of \"They don't deserve my money\" that people always throw around concerning the likes of Ubisoft or EA is an incredibly idiotic argument to justify piracy. If there is a product by a company you want to consume then purchase it. I don't agree with the human rights violations that happen in China or Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean I'm justified to steal the products produced there in lieu of boycotting them.\n\nI feel like I should add as an addendum that there is one situation where I have thought it was justified to pirate a movie, and would have if I had been able to. My father was bedridden while fighting Lung Cancer and wanted to see the second Hobbit. There was no way he could have sat through it at the theater, and we knew he wouldn't be around long enough for a DVD release. That is such an extreme case though, that I hard think that it can be used as a justification for the existence of the Pirate Bay.\n\nEdit: Discovered that we're having car problems this morning (x2) so I may not be around to respond for a couple hours, but I will!\n\nEdit 2: Also glad that every comment I make, though being substantive and contributing to discussion, is getting downvoted.

Either I had to return the last one I had to get the next rental, or pay full price for the one I keep and then I can rent again. I was also able to ask for rentals from other stores be delivered to my local store for my pick up if it was unavailable. I had influence on inventory. I did this often with obscure older TV show seasons. I have not that ability to influence and request anything be delivered to me at my whim here. \n\n&gt;You're paying to have access to those goods only for the time they are available to you, not indefinitely.\n\nI am paying the services to stream content. I am not paying for renting. That is why there is a \"rent\" button available for digital content if its available to rent. If i was only renting the content everything would have a lease time (24-48 hrs access  like on Google play and Vudu) on it explicitly. There is none. \n\n&gt;In physical goods terms, it's like you are renting a car for a month, keep it for a year, but only want to pay for the month that you agreed to keep it.\n\nWrong, I am paying month to month on Hulu, and yearly for Prime.

There is also no situation where I would pirate a recently released game for the same reason.\n\nFurther, the argument of \"They don't deserve my money\" that people always throw around concerning the likes of Ubisoft or EA is an incredibly idiotic argument to justify piracy. If there is a product by a company you want to consume then purchase it. I don't agree with the human rights violations that happen in China or Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean I'm justified to steal the products produced there in lieu of boycotting them.\n\nI feel like I should add as an addendum that there is one situation where I have thought it was justified to pirate a movie, and would have if I had been able to.

I heard Dragon Age and Star Wars: KOTR were great games.  They probably are.  Does that mean I LIKE them?  No.  I bought them, played them for about half an hour, and realized I hated them.  I read reviews, thought I'd like the story, and then playing them, realized I couldn't stand the mechanics and how dated it was.  Is that my fault, or theirs?  No, not really.  But do I wish I hadn't purchased them since I essentially got zero use/enjoyment out of them?  Sure do.  Conversely, I tried Audiosurf and Fallout 3, as I wasn't sure I'd like them.  Ended up really enjoying them, and buying both games, confident in the knowledge that I'd continue to play and get use out of them.  The problem with physical goods, is that me taking home THAT apple or THAT car means that someone else can't have them, and that the company can no longer sell that specific apple/car because I took it.

I've agonized over purchases that could have been easily decided with the ability to try it first.

Someone produced a good, charges money for it, and someone else circumvents the charge to consume the good. \n\nBut at the same time, the \"good\" in question, is a piece of information. \n\nAll right, let's call that information someone's \"property\", and it's copying \"theft\" for the sake of argument. \n\nBuit it is *still a freedom of information issue* at the same time, because treating an idea or an expression as it's creator's property, inherently means censoring others from expressing that idea or expression. \n\nWhen you sing a new song, and claim that it's \"yours\", then ask the government to stop others from singing it publically, you are censoring some of  those others' means of expression. If you treat writing a song as the same as building a car, then you might claim that other people singing whatever they want is like stealing a car, but ultimately you are treating singing as theft. Whether or not you should have a right to silence them, is still a matter of freedom of expression.\n\nI'm **not** saying that all copyrights should be abolished because they are censorship, because even if they are, they can be a necessary evil, that we need make our arts profitable.  For example, I think no one should be allowed to *sell* someone else's ideas for profit without permission. \n\nBut deciding how much control creators should get, *is a freedom of expression issue*. You have to make a decision of how much to restrict the public's ability to freely communicate, share data, you have to silence websites and regulate the Internet's information flow. \n\nIt's not enough to say that personal file-sharing is \"good for the industry\", you have to decide that this \"good for the industry\" outweights the freedom of expression restrictions that it means for the public. \n\nWhen the industry was already huge and profitable anyways while coexisting with piracy, and attacks against piracy have been known to harm legitimate communication in friendly fire, it's not unlikely that we would be better off by letting freedom of expression claim this particular area of life, and restrict copyright control to the matters of commercial data sale.

Maybe it's time for artists to drop the \"property\" claim and look for other ways to make creativity profitable. \n\nCrowdfunding, live performance, collector's physical copies, tie-in merchandise, advertisements,  are all ways to profit from creative work without restricting the information flow of the Internet, even while working together with it. \n\nIf we *can* encourage a system where all creative works are freely available for everyone to try, and money is earned through other means, isn't that better than insisting on the 18th century model against the tide? \n\n"}, {"id": "cmru6b7", "body": "&gt;What I don't understand are the people that hold it as some sort of right to have access to anything and everything at no charge simply because they have an internet connection.\n\nFreedom of information, isn't that a laudable ideal? We have technology that makes it possible to supply any kind of information to anyone with an internet connection. Why sabotage it so safeguard the monetary interests of a wealthy few? \n\nDon't worry about the film production, if people don't get their fix of Sequel VI: The Repetition, they'll find a way to get money to the right people.\n\n&gt;There is no situation where I would illegally download a move that was just released in theaters (or before it was released). That is flat out stealing, and harms the industry as a whole. There is also no situation where I would pirate a recently released game for the same reason.\n\nI would consider it justified under a try-before-you-buy philosophy, but I generally agree that it's distasteful to expect fast service for free. Then again, if people really would exploit this and almost nobody would *buy* new games, then the source would dry up... and then people would start paying for games.\n\nThe difference would be that people pay to produce a game, rather than for a disk on the store shelves, and they don't expect exclusivity; the effect is still the same: they pay, they get a game. I consider that progress on all counts, if only because companies don't have to try to ram existing games through our throats just because they produced them already, found out it was shit too late, and now have to try to recoup their costs.\n\n&gt;Further, the argument of \"They don't deserve my money\" that people always throw around concerning the likes of Ubisoft or EA is an incredibly idiotic argument to justify piracy. If there is a product by a company you want to consume then purchase it. I don't agree with the human rights violations that happen in China or Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean I'm justified to steal the products produced there in lieu of boycotting them.\n\nThey can't know if it's shit before they tried it, and trying first would be sensible if you expect them to screw it up..."}, {"id": "cmrv5uh", "body": "&gt;Freedom of information, isn't that a laudable ideal?\n\nIt's not \"freedom of information\", it's stealing.

The people who are putting those torrents up, are stealing money from the creators of those products.\n\nWhy not both? \n\nAll right, let's call that information someone's \"property\", and it's copying \"stealing\" for the sake of argument. \n\nBut at the same time, the \"products\" in question, are strings of information, and the money that their creator could have earned, would have been earned through monetizing the exclusive right to communicate that information and silence anyone else attempting to do so too.  \n\nIt's not an either-or situation between theft and freedom of information, it's a \"how much of which\". Deciding how much more copyright creators should have, inherently means deciding how much less ability the public should have to communicate freely. We can agree that creators shouls be somehow made profitable, but it's a zero sum game, all money you divert in their direction is taken from somewhere else, and all rights you give them means restricting someone else.  \n\nThe problem with forgetting the freedom of information side, and treating it as an obvious value to give artists as much property rights as possible, is that we might end up erring on the side of excessive regulations that are less good for society  than a more liberal approach. When even the most marginal, most dubiously useful, most intrusive, and most infeasible copyright elements, (such as the right to censor sites used for personal filesharing), are being enshrined as property rights, and their infringement as theft, we are puting more stock in legal principles, than in practically arranging our lives. \n\nWhen the industry was already huge and profitable anyways while coexisting with piracy, and attacks against piracy have been known to harm legitimate communication in friendly fire, it's not unlikely that we would be better off by letting freedom of expression claim this particular area of life (let the Internet be free), and restrict copyright control to the matters of commercial data sale, where it can do some real good.

It comes across as people thinking that piracy is justified because big studios charge too much money for their goods.\n\nThat is as plain as it gets. If studios didn't charge so much and theaters didn't charge so much, piracy would largely go away.\n\n&gt;I understand that Piracy can force the market to adapt in order to lower prices or allow for easier access, and this leads to the birth of Steam or Netflix. What I don't understand are the people that hold it as some sort of right to have access to anything and everything at no charge simply because they have an internet connection.\n\nOnly a part of the whole feel entitled to everything. They aren't necessarily the norm. There are different reasons why people pirate. Sense of entitlement is definitely one. But people who don't have that same sense of entitlement aren't going to be able to understand the rationalization that takes place in these peoples' minds.\n\n&gt;Further, the argument of \"They don't deserve my money\" that people always throw around concerning the likes of Ubisoft or EA is an incredibly idiotic argument to justify piracy. If there is a product by a company you want to consume then purchase it. I don't agree with the human rights violations that happen in China or Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean I'm justified to steal the products produced there in lieu of boycotting them.\n\nThat is hypocrisy. You can't condemn the actions of a company and still be their consumer. If you are that opposed to a company's moral or ethical failings, if you truly believe in 'the cause' then you can't rationalize your way past that. So i agree with you there.\n\n&gt;I feel like I should add as an addendum that there is one situation where I have thought it was justified to pirate a movie, and would have if I had been able to. My father was bedridden while fighting Lung Cancer and wanted to see the second Hobbit. There was no way he could have sat through it at the theater, and we knew he wouldn't be around long enough for a DVD release. That is such an extreme case though, that I hard think that it can be used as a justification for the existence of the Pirate Bay.\n\nFrankly if there was ANY situation where you would personally justify piracy, even in the case of a dying parent or relative, then you aren't totally against it. It's either wrong in any and every case, or it's not. Personally i understand your motivations there, and sympathize. But you can't be against something and then have one or two situations where you abandon that high road. \n\nOn a side-note, the pirate bay, with its obvious reputation, isn't only used for \"illegal downloading\". Music artists have taken to posting their own material to break out of the cycle of systematic financial enslavement of artists by the RIAA. It's a better, faster way of getting their music out into the open. Game designers have done the same thing, using the pirate bay and other similar sites to get their stuff out there. \n\nAlso, the unwillingness to give up on old methods of doing business. Instead of utilizing the technology that's available and ALREADY immensely popular among consumers, the industry insists on hard media purchased at retail outlets. Only now is digital media taking a bigger share of the market, but how long have torrents been around? And also, why do companies think they should get away woth charging the same price for hard media AND digital? So instead of conforming to consumer trends and technological advances, and fucking evolving their business plan, they spend millions upon millions of dollars buying out our fucking government to influence the laws in their favor, and people are going to prison and getting more time than those who go away for FUCKING MURDER.

Here's a list of reasons why:\n\n1) Claims of Intellectual Property: The whole idea of this is ridiculous. To simply have an idea does not give you ownership of said idea. An idea is not tangible. An idea is not something I can hold in my hand and say \"look at what I have thought of\". Now once that \"idea\" becomes a physical medium (I.E. a book, a movie, a dvd, a cd or even a file) then claims to ownership can be made. The argument of \"My idea has become a creation. My creations is this book or this song\" stands.\n\n2) So once the physical medium is created, where should it go? Should the creator hoard every copy of the movie he or she has created?

Take speeding for instance, a crime quite possibly more prevalent than piracy. Does everyone who speeds get pulled over? No. Do cops radar speeding cars and then let them keep going? Absolutely. Because there's a cost-benefit analysis. If they pull over the guy going 57 in the 55, there's a chance that they'll miss the guy going 85 in the 55 while he's writing the ticket for the 57. Until there's a way not to waste resources going after the minor offenders to the point where you'd miss the big ones, enforcement is going to be \u00e0 la carte.

Property law is just when the Chief says \"Ugh, stop fighting over that stick, let's say that it belongs to whoever I can recall having possessed it for the longest time, and *I* will club anyone in the head who disagrees with this\". \n\nIn comparison, information is naturally spreading out just by getting repeated. One caveman sings a song, the others hear it, sing it elsewhere, yet others hear the copy, and so on. The first singer (not that there was a \"first one\", ancient art evolved organically, as opposed to specific \"original IPs\"), wouldn't even have possessed it's flow for a second. That control wasn't *taken from him* like a stick, it *didn't ever exist*. \n\nProperty had a physical grounding even before law, but copyright is a *purely legal* idea. Having a right to an IP is like having a right to a certain unemployment benefit, or a right to a free public education. It's certainly exists, but it's entirely invented and given to you by legislators for a reason, rather than just declaring your inherent right to your stuff not being violated. \n\nIn other words, it's a claim right, not a liberty right.\n\n\nThis distinction is important. When people call piracy \"stealing\",  they try to evoke the image that a song can be taken away from it's \"rightful owner\" as surely as a stick, while really they are trying to pull a fast one on anyone who might be tempted to think too hard about exactly why we started to regulate copyrights in the 18th century (not for the same reason why we started to let people keep their sticks), and whether that justification still applies to anti-filesharing mechanisms. \n\n"}, {"id": "cmrvyuz", "body": "They're calling it piracy but it's not, it's sharing.

The human race could function survive if every drop of oil vanished tomorrow, that doesn't mean that's a world I want to live in.\n\nIf you want to get an idea of the results of rampant piracy, look at China. The result essentially, is that Pay to Win MMOs are the only kind of video game, the music industry makes most of its money off subscription ringtones, and blockbusters are the only kind of movie. For all that pirates loves to prattle about how they're fighting the big corps, it's the little artists who suffer the most because big corps have access to alternative modes of production which are better protected from pirates( can you see a small bunch of gamers getting out there to make a pay to win MMO?)"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2oyzcg", "body": "In many, perhaps most, accusations of rape, consent is inherently difficult to ascertain. Policies requiring strict standards of evidence to prove that rape occurred will leave victims with no way to demonstrate that the crime occurred. Policies that relax their standards of evidence will unjustly punish some who are unfairly accused. The base rate for real versus false accusations is not so obviously lopsided that it renders the question moot. Thus, any proposed solution will be unfair to a significant number of people.\n\nI believe campus rape response policies can be improved in many ways, especially in treating victims more compassionately. However, any improvements will necessarily be limited by the inherent evidential limits of most rapes.\n\nCMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

At least, not for things which are illegal outside the college.\n\nI agree that it's foolish to conflate separate systems but you're doing just that to the criminal court and the college disciplinary process.  Both are technically \"disciplinary\" but they're completely distinct.  Criminal courts exist to serve the public.  The penalties are severe and a violation of rights (incarceration, even death) so the standard is extremely stringent.  This is where 'beyond a reasonable doubt', evidentiary standards and all the rest come into play.  On the other hand private disciplinary processes exist to serve the parties directly involved (business, clients etc) and their penalties never involve a violation of rights.  Like the penalties, the standards are far lighter.\n\nThe conflation is an expectation of \"due process\" under a private system, and the notion that one act can't be actionable under several systems.  I'm sure you're familiar with how one act can be both criminal and civil.  Well it can also fall under a private system (really an extension of contract law).  Private entities acting on their own discretion.  It's pretty pervasive when you start looking for it.  If I stole from my company I wouldn't expect to continue working there, regardless of the court outcome.  Likewise if I wrecked a store display there's no reason they would be obligated to keep doing business with me.  Or if I sexually harassed a friend at their home, there's no reason they can't kick me out.\n\nNone of those \"penalties\" violate my rights, so there's no expectation of criminal due process.  If a store can refuse business and a person can refuse admittance why can't a private school refuse admission?  You have no *right* to attend.  It's pretty obvious that attendance is contingent on achieving certain standards.

My contention is not only that relaxing the standards throw people under the bus, but that upholding them *also* leads to an unfair outcome--and in both cases, it is unfair to a degree beyond the usual uncertainty of the justice system."}, {"id": "cms9os5", "body": "The fundamental problem is that making crimes easier to prosecute is inseparable from increasing the risk of convicting innocents.  They are two sides of the same coin and you simply can't do one without the other.  \n\nOne way to think of it is as a spectrum.  On the one side every prosecution is successful and many innocents are imprisoned.  On the other side no innocent is ever imprisoned but many guilty people go free.  As a society we've chosen a balance point between the two extremes and called it fair.\n\nThe reason I mentioned that balance in my previous post is that what you've done is identified a case where you believe the balance point society has chosen is off, but you're troubled by the fact that we can't move the balance point without also moving towards one of those two troubling extremes.  \n\nBut that's like being upset that life is unfair or that wealth matters.  For as long as it's possible for humans to err, the balance point of human justice will always exist somewhere on this spectrum.  You can believe the balance point should be shifted, and you can argue over which direction and by how much, but there's no value in being troubled but the fact that we are unable to move off the spectrum entirely.\n\nAnd I'd further suggest that the balance point we have might be reasonable.  You view the idea of rapists going unpunished as indicative of an inherent flaw in the system.  While that would obviously be a flaw in an idealized system, I'd suggest the very ugly truth is that rapists going unpunished is the real-world system working, not only as it's supposed to, but as best it can.  (Ignoring obvious procedural problems like police not investigating accusations, police systematically choosing not to believe accusers, never testing rape kits, etc. that I think we can all agree are problematic and need to be addressed.)  \n\nRapists go free because we don't know for certain they are guilty.  We don't know they are guilty because rape is, as you point out, not as easy to identify and quantify as murder.  But if we have a hard time describing the crime, and we have a hard time identifying the crime, and we have a hard time proving the crime, then we *should* have a hard time imprisoning people for committing the crime.  That's the system working as designed."}, {"id": "2oyzcg", "body": "In many, perhaps most, accusations of rape, consent is inherently difficult to ascertain.

But going to the courts isn't what people such as OP are pushing back against; they're pushing back against any and all policies universities - who *do not have the force of the courts to impose \"those punishments* - can take to make things even a little better.\n\nThe comment threads on this post are a great example of why this is so hard to do, and why large numbers of people will continue to be assaulted and raped.  People love to jump to the hypothetical defense of the hypothetical future falsely-accused, while actively promoting more rape and pretending they're not doing so with their eyes over their eyes and in their ears."}, {"id": "cmscwqz", "body": "&gt; Your whole comment pretends that university polices would have the same force as courts of law.\n\nNO! My argument is that even if it doesn't go to the court of law it HAS CONSEQUENCES. DIRE CONSEQUENCES for the accused.\n\n&gt;while making it clearer to others that what the attacker did a) happened\n\nNO! You can't make it clearer that it a) happened because you don't know if it a) happened because there is no proof that it a) happened. You're automatically siding with the \"victim\", but you can't even prove that there has been a crime! As I said before, there are many situations in which the victim can have consented and thought she was raped afterwards not to mention that the victim can simply lie because she wants to.\n\nTHAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THIS KIND OF RAPE DOESN'T EXIST! IT DOES AND I RECOGNIZE THAT! But you can't tell the difference between the ones that do exist (even if they are the vast majority) and the ones that don't. More than that, you're not even trying to.\n\n&gt;There are plenty of reasons why most never do, and those reasons have little to do with whether the attack actually happened or was actually wrong\n\nI agree completely, it doesn't mean that you can point at someone and affirm he has raped a woman without him being prosecuted. Of course it was wrong if it happened, I never tried to imply otherwise. \n\nNow stop blabbing that I am promoting rape. I don't feel comfortable denying some kind of justice to the victims, but you cannot impose punishment on people with only the word of another person to justify it. It's not (only) about the future falsely-accused, it is about several fundaments of our current justice system. No, a PERSON is not legally bound to assume innocence, therefore you can have what opinion you want about if the crime happened or not, but the campus should not punish anyone without proof. It is simple as that.

I have work with a lot of former criminals, these guys were thieves and we're often violent but when I worked with them they were just my mates like anyone else. When they were criminals they were doing so because they had no other option in their opinion, they all had low levels of education, some had terrible people skills, some had an upbringing that socialised them with acceptance of a criminal lifestyle. There are many situations that can make someone turn to crime it is not as simple as \"they are bad people\". \n\nMy employer at the time was a guy that never did police checks so he gave these guy an opportunity to do legitimate work. Many guys that have turned to crime in their past find it difficult to find worthwhile work so even if they are reformed before long they might not have a choice in their opinion but to turn to crime to get ahead.\n\nLooking at it in such a black and white way is part of the reason these guys struggle to reintegrate into society and perpetuates the existence of recidivism."}, {"id": "cmrut93", "body": "Like I said before, I'm only referring to people who do this as their *primary* form of income acquisition."}, {"id": "cms7155", "body": "Well, OK, since you asked ...\n\nIf they use the money they steal in a way that is more beneficial to the economy, or people in general, than the original owner, then they are a net *economic* benefit. \n\nThe easiest way to see this is, for example, to take a billionaire who sits around all day doing nothing. Perhaps inherited it all and has never done a thing for anybody. However, thanks to the rules of society, we say that they \"own\" this money and so when it gets used for value (investment, purchases, etc.) then we say that *person* did something of value when they actually did nothing. Suppose that money is just locked up, or tied up in cash or being unused, or some general asset just sitting there.\n\nThe thief then steals that money and, because it is their primary form of income, as you say, they use it to pay for rent, food, utilities, etc. They become a consumer and create demand, and that demand creates more products and jobs.\n\nThis is a more efficient use of money. Put another way, 1000 people with $1000 may buy 1000 TVs. One person with $1 million (same total) will only buy a few TVs. Generally speaking, a rich person has more excess and, from an economic point of view, is much less efficient use of the money toward the health and growth of the economy. The more money sits still, the worse for the economy.\n\nSo, in that sense, there is potential benefit in it. And, to take your original argument, would you then agree that killing a layabout billionaire is *also* just as justified. After all, if their only contribution is their money, that doesn't change when they are killed; the money is still there, goes to somebody else (or more people), and gets spent at least as well and possibly better by dividing it up to more people.\n\nOr what about the disabled? Or invalid? Or vegetative?\n\nNote that I don't think this justifies the death of any of them.
