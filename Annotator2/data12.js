Going back to my female warrior thing, no societies needed a bunch of small weaklings getting themselves hurt or in battle when fighting larger, stronger, and better equipped enemies, and leaving society without anyone to actually give birth to the next generation. But what you're not getting is that while it's done to enforce a certain outcome, none of the expectations are being pulled out of thin air. It's not like we're making the sexes do things they're not already likely to do, we're just channeling those impulses to an end. \n\nNote how men are never expected to just settle for things. They always have to strive for the top any way they can. Why? Because they already do it in a bid for female attention, and it *works* both for them and for society.

I feel like we can all advocate for equality without having to blame a certain group or overgeneralize a whole gender. \n\nAnd to avoid hypocricy... not all feminists do this. They really don't. I have met some great women and men that identified as a feminist. But it is hard to discount that this group has gotten out of hand. Often the loudest voices recieve the most attention and usually those voices come from the mouths of radical people. That said, the unfortunate truth is feminism either has a bad PR problem or it is becoming a radicalized shell of its former self. \n\nChange my view...\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV"}, {"id": "cmw0e92", "body": "First off, I just want to mention that the site you linked to in several comments is extraordinarily conspiratorial.\n\n&gt;The cost of healthcare in the U.S. has been increasing at a rate much faster than inflation and is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis is reasonably true. It's also true that employer contributions to health care, and government assistance for medical care have also risen. So while prices have gotten higher, the increases aren't quite as high when it comes to out of pocket expenses (still have increased though).\n\n&gt;Unlike other OECD countries, the U.S. does not regulate the profits that drug and medical device manufacturers can make. As a result the average American spends way more on healthcare than any other individual in another OECD country\n\nKind of a non-sequitur. The high cost of the US healthcare system are definitely affected by the lack of profit regulation with regards to drugs and medical devices, but there are so many other aspects involved, that it's kind of misguided to blame it all on  this (your CMV as a whole seems kind of misguided in this way).\n\n&gt;and we aren't even on top when it comes to longevity or child mortality rates. \n\nThe difference is negligible and lifestyles / behaviors play a huge role in this which are kind of exogenous to the healthcare system. Additionally, in several areas we are absolutely #1 (morbidity of many specific procedures). The differences themselves are actually pretty minor (from first to the US it's typically within 5 years, depending on how it is measured).\n\n&gt;As an American tax payer I don't see why it is fair that I pay an obscenely large amount of money in both taxes and healthcare care premiums so that these companies can make billions of dollars in profit.\n\nThis kind of thinking is that economics is zero-sum (that their profits are at the expense of other's incomes), when it's not at all. The degree of profit is often a pretty good indicator of how much value a firm is contributing.\n\nHere's some actual economic research:\n\n[The Cost of US Pharmaceutical Price Reductions: A Financial Simulation Model of R&amp;D Decisions](http://www.nber.org/papers/w11114), the paper, [The Effect of Price Controls on Pharmaceutical Research](http://www.nber.org/digest/may05/w11114.html), a brief synopsis.\n\n&gt;...cutting prices by 40 to 50 percent in the United States will lead to **between 30 and 60 percent fewer R and D projects being undertaken in the early stage of developing a new drug**...one economic problem is that **only 3 out of every 10 of their products generate after-tax returns (measured in present value terms) in excess of average, after-tax R and D costs**. The scientific process is heavily regulated, and involves significant technical risk. Only one in several thousand compounds investigated ever makes it through the full development process to gain approval of the Food and Drug Administration. The vast majority of R and D projects fail for reasons related to safety, efficacy, or commercial viability, the authors note. For compounds that do gain FDA approval and are taken to market, the entire process from discovery to launch takes on average about 15 years.\n\nOn the differences in EU firms, [European Pharmaceutical Price Regulation, Firm Profitability, and R&amp;D Spending](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12676)\n\n&gt; Compared to EU firms, U.S. firms are more profitable, earn higher stock returns, and spend more on research and development (R&amp;D). Some differences have increased over time. In 1986, EU pharmaceutical R&amp;D exceeded U.S. R&amp;D by about 24 percent, but by 2004, EU R&amp;D trailed U.S. R&amp;D by about 15 percent. During these 19 years, U.S. R&amp;D spending grew at a real annual compound rate of 8.8 percent, while EU R&amp;D spending grew at a real 5.4 percent rate. Results show that EU consumers enjoyed much lower pharmaceutical price inflation, however, **at a cost of 46 fewer new medicines introduced by EU firms** and 1680 fewer EU research jobs.\n\n[Assessing Consumer Gains from a Drug Price Control Policy in the U.S.](http://www.nber.org/papers/w11139), probably the most relevant.\n\n&gt;...from a drug price control regime that holds drug price increases to the same rate of growth as the general consumer price level...that same drug price control regime **would have led to 198 fewer new drugs being brought to the U.S. market over this period**. Therefore, we approximate that the average social opportunity cost per drug developed during this period to be approximately $1.6 billion. Recent research on the value of pharmaceuticals suggests that **the social benefits of a new drug may be far greater than this estimated social opportunity cost**.\n\n[Pharmaceutical Innovation, Mortality Reduction, and Economic Growth](http://www.nber.org/papers/w6569)\n\n&gt;...**new drugs have increased life expectancy, and lifetime income, by about 0.75-1.0% per annum**. The drug innovation measures are also strongly positively related to the reduction in life-years lost in both periods. Some of the more conservative estimates imply that **a one-time R&amp;D expenditure of about $15 billion subsequently saves 1.6 million life-years per year**, whose annual value is about $27 billion.\n\nI've made a comment elsewhere that I hope you'll answer in regard to several statements you made on them having *too much profit*. That was:\n\n&gt;What is the threshold for having too much profits and how do you objectively go about determining it? What metrics would you even use considering total profits is heavily biased?"}, {"id": "2pe4sy", "body": "The cost of healthcare in the U.S. has been [increasing at a rate much faster than inflation and is showing no signs of slowing down.](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+healthcare+vs+inflation&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=xAJ&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9D-PVIyrEsScyASKooLACw&amp;ved=0CEMQsAQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=799) Unlike other OECD countries, the U.S. does not regulate the profits that drug and medical device manufacturers can make.

Even if you don't actually raise the money (i.e. just pay it yourself) other people will. It simply makes them more money (both more donators and larger donations) than it would otherwise.\n\nI'll give you this example: I like boardgames. There are three kinds of boardgame events: 1) for profit 2) expanding the hobby 3) charity. \n\nFor profit events (1) are very, very hard to organise and usually fail. \n\nEvents to raise the hobby (2) are great but it means that the organiser will generally spend large amounts of money and time and get very little out of it so they are often not repeated. \n\nA charity event (3) has several benefits - charities often have better organisation and might be able to help provide startup funding.  People who don't know anything about boardgames might go along because they want to support the charity. People are more willing to pay for entry because they are supporting the charity. These events generally make a profit for the charity where the same event would be loss making venture for an individual. The fact that the event was a success often makes the time and effort worthwhile for the organiser (even if they don't personally pocket the profits) where otherwise a \"failed\" event would cause them give up. Ultimately it has made money for a charity *and* brought enjoyment to people. Now consider that you want to use a public building for you event or, worse still, shut down half the inner city (e.g. for a run). Do you think the government is going to be more likely to help a for profit individual or a charity? \n\nIf you want to run 5k, pick a nice route on [Draft Logic](http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm) and go for a run. But if you want to be part of an event you have to consider that the people who organise it are doing so to raise money for charity.

The notion of the nation shifted past its initial ethnic limitations to encompass anybody who embraces the national culture.

This evolution was moreover arguably caused to a large extent by World War Two and the extreme racism and xenophobia of nazism. \n\n&gt; And those that did exist have generally decomposed\n\nThis is not true. You're cherry picking those states that fit your paradigm. Other successful multi-ethnic states in Europe would include the UK, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Russia or Norway, while long-established minorities exist in practically every country. Indeed, it\u2019s worth pointing out that the concept of the nation state was an artificial one in the first place and sufficient ethnic uniformity was only achieved in many cases with mass assimilations, war, revolution, massacres, pogroms and population exchanges. Giving up on the idea of a single ethnic nation is a return to the natural state of things \u2013 that is also why xenophobia, as opposed to simple racism, is a much more important concept in Europe than in the US.\n\n&gt; unity in language, culture, and vision are very useful things\n\nThe US has all of these things, to a greater extent in fact than many European countries and over a larger territory and population than all of them. \n"}, {"id": "cmwa41d", "body": "I totally disagree with the notion that there isn't discrimination based on race/ethnicity in the United States or that it is less than that in Sweden.\n\nI do disagree with the notion that European nations are held together primarily with an aspirational identity.

But you do have problems with immigrants.\n\nThat might be because the notion of race and nation have been combined. In the United States we don't have a common race and we have a baker's dozen of subcultures that only sometimes get along. Really the only thing that Americans have tying us together is aspirational identity. We all want more or less the same thing and can put aside most of it to get here.\n\nThat's what you're lacking. You have a very clear understanding of what Sweden should be. They don't know, don't understand, or don't agree with what your vision is and are therefore aren't working with you, which is a problem. You want them to make themselves Swedish, but there is this left over ethnic component to Sweden which means that even if they were to try they would never fully succeed.\n\nAt this point you are either going to have to put a lot of effort into getting these immigrants on board with your view of Sweden, or change what it means to be Swedish. After all, the problem is simply a case of a mismatch of expectations and reality. You must change your expectations or change reality.\n\nI would call it nationalism with a entho-centric twinge, but I'm a white southern American male... what would I know of the various flavors of racism?"}, {"id": "cmw9bu1", "body": "&gt; &amp;#8710;\n\n"}, {"id": "2pdauv", "body": "In Sweden the issue of increased immigration and if it's a problem or not, and if so how to fix it, has started to bother me quite a bit. I used to be the guy with dreadlocks who listened to rage against the machine. Every view I had was left/red. \n\nNow I no longer feel that way. After moving to a larger city (from a small town) i've started to dislike people more and more, but mostly those whose language I can't understand. Disliking the culture, the customs, the languages themselves.\n\nI feel like the government forces us to interact too. I've been trying to do the \"Swedish thing\" for the longest time now (I.e just live around the entire situation, not interacting with it). But work programs and other things just seem to force things. Previous workplace was the worst. Worked there for a year, and one in twenty immigrants knew English/Swedish and had zero interest in learning more (they were supposed to take days off to go to Swedish class, but this rarely happened).\n\nFor the record I am 24 tears old, a dude, and I do know that not all people of a group of people are bad. But lately less and less seem to be a redeeming factor.\n\nChange my view please.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I don't see how it is a racist to want people that come to your country for opportunity to not exploit, but follow the law and contribute to the community. Why do you feel that is racist?\n\n2. I suppose this is merging somewhat with point #1. If the immigrants are behaving in criminal ways, then you need to accept that viewing them as criminals, perhaps not unsympathetically, is not racist. However, viewing all their customs and culture as bad probably is. That said, it's hard to not start disliking the culture if you associate it with criminals. It's a Pavlovian affect. If someone looks and dresses like a Roma, we've come to associate that with crime and we avoid them even if they seem neither dirty or criminal individually. And, it's easy to think that the culture is bad because it keeps creating criminals. It's an over simplification of the issue, but it's just something the average human mind does.\n\nI also live in a big city that has immigrant issues. The real problem, as far as I can tell, is that they move here with the stated goal of being an American, but when they come here, they refuse to be one. What's the point of moving to another country and totally changing your world, if you don't want to change your life? It's utterly baffling.  I can understand wanting to keep some customs, some traditions. They are good, but to move to Sweden and wholesale reject all things Swedish  (other than the money) is just plain weird to me. Accepting that sort of thinking as strange is, again, not the same thing as racist.\n\n3.

After moving to a larger city (from a small town) i've started to dislike people more and more, but mostly those whose language I can't understand. Disliking the culture, the customs, the languages themselves.\n\nI feel like the government forces us to interact too. I've been trying to do the \"Swedish thing\" for the longest time now (I.e just live around the entire situation, not interacting with it). But work programs and other things just seem to force things. Previous workplace was the worst. Worked there for a year, and one in twenty immigrants knew English/Swedish and had zero interest in learning more (they were supposed to take days off to go to Swedish class, but this rarely happened).\n\nFor the record I am 24 tears old, a dude, and I do know that not all people of a group of people are bad.
