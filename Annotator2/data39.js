I know what you are going to say, when guns are illegal only criminals will have guns. In transition maybe. A good example is a country of Poland, a former communist state which had very lax gun control laws right after the fall of communism. There was violent organized crime and firearm-related deaths were around 4 per 100,000 per year. The gun-control laws were expanded and right now very few private citizens own guns. Gun-related deaths rate went down to 0.25. Just like in the UK. The rate in Japan is 0.06. On the other end of the spectrum let's take countries who have poor gun control laws: Switzerland, a rich, civilized country 3.84 gun-related deaths per 100,000 per year. Finland recently relaxed their gun control laws: 3.64. US is almost in the range of violent and lawless third world countries with 10.30.

The go to comparison for macro is often meteorology because they both suffer from a lot of the same problems: inability to do large scale experimentation, incredibly high about of variables, etc. This is reflected in their fields inability to often accurately predict the future, it's just that the weather man being wrong doesn't have quite the same adverse effects. There are many other areas of the physical sciences that run into similar problems.\n\nThere is disagreement in the field, but it's more so for questions of what we *ought* to do, rather than what the results of a particular policy will be. What we ought to do is dependent on what we value and prioritize, but what will happen isn't subject to that bias. Most people in general are terrible with economics, a lot of common ideas can be pretty unintuitive for the laymen. You know how rarely Democrats and Republicans agree economically? Well they agree with each other twice as often as either group agrees with economists. You can have near consensus on an issue, [like this IGM poll on high-skill immigration](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0JtSLKwzqNSfrAF), and yet a large portion of the public hold the opposite opinion. This is all furthered by people using the label of economist as an authority while working for think tanks and putting out ideologically driven research to push an agenda. There's a huge difference in mentality between think tank and academic economists.\n\nThis thread, [How could there \"badeconomics\" when economics itself has yet stood up to scrutiny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/2nzqzj/how_could_there_badeconomics_when_economics/) addresses the issue quite well.

This makes it a lot easier to make a absolute claim about something. You could describe it as being neat(er) and tidy as opposed to the messiness of things like history. \n\nNow take a subject like History: you have events that are shaped by thousands if not millions of people. You simply can't isolate the things that matter from \"the background noise\" and that is even without considering the biases of the people that wrote the sources that you are working with. There are very few events in history that actually have a simple answer. Take the first world war for example: There really isn't that much of a consensus about who caused it. \n\nI think that everyone can greatly benefit from studying at least a bit from both fields. Mathematics, physics and chemistry can show people that some things are objectively true and how the study things in a very deliberate and thorough way. History, political sciences and anthropology can show people that a lot of things in life are highly subjective and that a lot of things can change radically if you interpret it in a different way. \n\n"}, {"id": "2okzs7", "body": "I\u2019m want to be a fact based person, I want to live a life pursuing knowledge and truth.

I'm a 24 year old guy living in the United States. For various reasons, I've never had anything close to a girlfriend nor do I see it happening. Reasons include: I have universally undesirable physical traits (shortness being the main one), I'm naturally a shy and quiet person, and my inexperience makes my attempts to flirt with girls almost comical.\n\nIt's seriously affecting my life. My heart is heavy every day I have to walk outside and see couples holding hands, nuzzling each other, spending the holidays with each other. Yesterday I grudgingly went to my friend's house for dinner and had to sit there while he and his girlfriend were practically glowing with their care and love for each other. It made me extremely depressed.\n\nI've asked out dozens of girls and gotten rejected. This desire for someone to love me has taken over my life and it's started to encroach on my productivity. And worse, I don't think it's ever going to happen. I read from a CDC study that once males in the United States hit 25 without losing their virginity, very few of them ever get out of that category.\n\nI wish it would all go away. I fully believe that if a pill or procedure is developed to exterminate my sex drive cleanly, I would enthusiastically take it. Imagine how much better my life would be. Imagine being able to focus those thoughts, resources and energy towards productive pursuits instead of always having this relationship woe at the back of my mind, tugging me down like an anchor.\n\nI know that there are ways to curb one's sex drive, like SSRIs and surgery. But they always involve nasty side effects, that's why I'm talking about a hypothetical pill that would destroy my sex drive forever but without side effects.\n\nCan someone convince me this is a bad idea?\n\n**TL;DR: My sexuality is useless and there's no benefit from it. I've had no luck with women and don't forsee anything. Therefore if I could take a pill to instantly remove my sex drive forever, I'd do it happily. CMV.**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't want to go around diagnosing anything, but if you have insurance a visit to your doctor never hurts. I thought I was shy, it turns out I had Social Anxiety Disorder, and the first medicine prescribed to me made my life worse, but the second medication I tried made my life infinitely better than it had ever been. And, between that medicine and therapy, while still being an introvert with the need for alone time, I'm perfectly able to do all the extroverted things I wasn't able to do in the first 20 years of my life. But it did take a lot of hard work, both hard work of my own and that of my doctor and therapist.\n\nI'm not the most attractive person. I'm a bit overweight, and have what I'd describe as a 'neutral' face. But I take the time before I go out to make sure my beard is trimmed perfectly, my hair looks good, and I've studied male fashion websites until I learned how to carve out a style more myself in which I feel comfortable and other people will think looks good. Their's nothing you can do about your height, and maybe you're not the most attractive person, but there are things you can do to make yourself more attractive to other people.\n\nNot to mention, it's been shown that if someone likes your personality they'll rate you at a higher level of attractiveness than people who don't know you.\n\nIf you're flirting is comical because you don't have experience, then flirt. It might not work at first, but keep doing it. Just like anything else, flirting takes practice, and you're late to the game. But that doesn't mean you can't catch up or at least improve yourself.\n\nNow, getting to the point of why taking a pill to get rid of your sex drive would be a bad idea. I love poetry. I write it as a hobby, I attend a weekly poetry reading, and a weekly workshop with other local poets. My greatest dream in life is to write a widely published full-sized book of poetry. A lot of other people don't like poetry. They don't get the same feeling as I do from a perfect mix of consonance, assonance and other sounds. They aren't moved to tears or laugh out loud when they read an emotional and well-written poem in some book.\n\nMy roommate is one of the people who doesn't experience the same things through poetry that I do. But, he's just as passionate about his job as a computer programmer as I am about poetry. It moves him to awe when he's able to write code that could potentially make tens of thousands of people's lives easier. I see how it'd feel good to create such a thing, but I don't understand being able to have such a passion about writing code.\n\nIn the same way, there is nothing wrong with being asexual. Some people are born that way, and that's okay. But if you're interested in sex, it really is a wonderful thing that can be experienced in so many different ways. And it isn't just that sex is awesome, my roommate will never get the opportunity to experience the human experience from the point of view of a poet because that's not how he thinks. And I'll never get to do the same from the point of view of a computer programmer. \n\nBut you have to the opportunity to experience the human experience from the angle that sex gives you. And, despite what we're told when we're young, it's not always good, it's not always magical, it's not always intimate. But, it is always personal in the sense that you get to see another person's behavior with all their inhibitions shed and vice versa, you get to engage in an activity whose only purpose (oftentimes) is mutual pleasure. You'll get to experience what it feels to make love with a long-term girlfriend, you'll learn what it feels like to sleep with a woman who wants you to be rough them, you'll learn what it feels like to take control, and you'll learn what it feels like to totally surrender yourself to someone. An asexual won't get to experience this, and that's okay because they have their own ways to experience the human condition. But, if your given the opportunity to experience the human condition by way of sexuality, willingly ridding yourself of such a wonderful opportunity is really a sad thing to do.\n\nAnd a lot of your reasoning for wanting to give it up is based upon factors that seem to be self loathing.\n\nInstead of letting that self-loathing make you want to give up something wonderful, use it to improve yourself. And, with 'improve yourself', I'm not saying get a job that makes you rich or find a way to become attractive, most of the time learning to dress and groom yourself well, and learning to break your shy-person tendencies is enough. (I understand breaking your shy tendencies is difficult because I've had to do it before. Studies show that shy people fare better in online dating because it's easier for them when their first interaction is via messages. If you haven't tried that yet, maybe you should try?)\n\nEDIT - Grammar and Spelling"}, {"id": "2okrzi", "body": "Pretty straightforward topic. I'm a 24 year old guy living in the United States.

I don't know how deep your emotional rabbit hole goes with these things, but all I can say is the excruciating pain won't go away. You'll feel just as lonely being left out of the sexual world, but now the door is not only closed, but locked. \n\nFrom my experience, the path of self-acceptance and internal growth that I had to go through to come to terms with my orientation is something you can go through too. Except you have the added benefit of, at the end of the tunnel, being able to have that additional layer of intimacy in the form of sexual attraction. And I'm not going to tell you that there's some sort of \"end\" to the process. You'll be struggling with it for the rest of your life, like *everybody* does. \n\nI'm not going to pretend to know what you need to do to get where you want to be, there's lots of self-actualizing advice on reddit you can find if you want to. But thinking that your inner turmoil stems from any one thing is not insightful, you need to dig deeper. It's a causal chain you need to follow to it's core, and you need to understand where the pain is really coming from. Basically, if your arm is numb, you don't cut off your arm. \n\nYou said you're short, therefore you're undesirable. That's a common meme among men. Is it a true generality? Probably. Does it have to be true for you? No. If you're using \"I'm short\" as a reason to consider yourself undesirable, then your real handicap isn't your height, it's your attitude toward yourself. You need to forgive yourself for whatever you consider to be your misgivings, and move forward in a way that builds upon your strengths. \n\nI'm friends with many men around your age. I've realized that you seem to draw your self-worth from how desirable and useful you are to others. Is that how you feel?

It is not \"un-manly.\" Respecting and caring for yourself is a powerful tool that will help you stand on your own when looking for relationships. \n\nI took a look through your post history, I hope you don't mind. You seemed to be doing alright, being yourself and all. Did you end up following through on that exercise plan? Are you still expressing your personal style in the way you dress?

If I am missing out on something, let me know, as it may contribute to changing my view.\n\n**My view**: Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Ep. 7) is, at its core, just an attempt to cash in on a valuable franchise, and doing so is disrespectful to fans of the Star Wars universe.\n\n**Background**\n\n* George Lucas made 6 movies, however good or bad, and denied, up until recently, that there would ever be a 7th movie. These movies represented the highest level of canon in the Universe, no other source contributing to the story of the Universe could contradict the movies. \n\n* Star Wars fans had given up on ever seeing a 7th movie, and thus turned to the next best thing: The Expanded Universe. The meat of the Expanded Universe consists of novels and video games, many of which are considered to be exceptional works in their own right (notably The Thrawn Trilogy, and KOTOR). \n\n* These works created some fantastic stories and characters, many of whom were incorporated into later works which all came together as one coherent, linear timeline.\n\n* However Lucas felt personally about the Expanded Universe, ultimately he was involved in the publication process and had final approval.\n\n* The decision was made to make Ep 7, not just a 7th movie. The characters from the Original Trilogy were to be used, and it was eventually decided that the original actors, (or at least Ford, Hamill, and Fisher) would be involved.\n\n**Arguments**\n\n##Argument 1: It ruins the structure of the timeline, and/or it degrades the value of the Expanded Universe.\n\nFrom a structural standpoint, one of my favorite things about Star Wars is that it is very easy to enter into. There are six movies, and if you want to know what happens after RotJ there is a definitive starting point: Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. There is an order of novels, video games, comic books, and etc that chronologically follow, fit in between, and predate the movie's in the Star Wars Universe's own timeline.\n\nConversely, while I love comic book movies, the multiple timelines, universes, and alternate realities in the source comic books is what prevents me from getting into them, as I don't know or am unable to find a starting point or follow the story lines. \n\nWith the purchase by Disney and the production of the 7th movie, they have relegated almost all of the Expanded Universe to an alternate reality. While the new movies may draw inspiration from these works, ultimately, the source material is no longer considered valid. These are stories that many people have loved, and they're now considered lesser. That bit just really stings. Further, it fragments the Universe's works in a confusing fashion similar to what happened with the classic comic book super heros.\n\nAll further arguments stem from this relegation, if not outright dismissal, of the existing Expanded Universe.\n\n##Argument 2: If additional movies will be made, there are other options that could be used that had an original story and didn't override the existing Expanded Universe then an Ep. 7 that follows closely after RotJ.\n\nThe Expanded Universe, and Lucas himself, has made it clear that it is okay to go beyond the scope of time consisting of the Original Trilogy. The Original Trilogy encompasses roughly a 4 year period. The Prequel Trilogy jumps back 32 years and then encompasses an ~14 year span, with a 10 year jump between TPM and AotC. Further, the Expanded Universe has made major jumps both forward and back, with KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 taking place roughly 4,000 years before ANH, and the Legacy books starting 130 years after ANH, both of which have met with success.\n\n##Argument 3: If an Ep 7 directly following RotJ is to be made, it should adapt a novel(s) from the EU that follows RotJ. \n\nThis decision doesn't alienate the super fans like myself by not trampling all over things they love, but also retains the semi- and casual fans having a concrete and exciting story with characters they already know and love. \n\n##Argument 4: Everything about the decision to make an Ep 7 following RotJ was just wrong.\n\nThe way I see it a 7th Star Wars movie could take one of four routes. The first being what I mentioned in Argument 2, make a movie well outside or not bound by the existing Expanded Universe, thus preserving it. It is now 37 years since ANH. The novels have also encompassed a similar time period. The second route is to use the same actors and jump to a point ~30 years after ANH. The third is to recast the roles and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy. The final decision is to do something completely new, not bound by existing works.\n\nEach decision has it ups. \n\n1. It is unbound by existing stories allowing for creative freedom, and it preserves the existing universe.\n\n2. Will strongly appeal to the hardcore fans that have allowed the franchise to grow. \n\n3. Will appeal to hardcore fans and casuals by using a story familiar to the hardcores and characters familiar to the casuals.\n\n4. Also unbound. \n\nEach decision has its downs. \n\n1. Takes the risk of having a bad story and/or unfamiliar and unappealing character. \n\n2. Would really only do well with the hardcore fans. \n\n3. Could upset, annoy, or confuse people by having unfamiliar faces attached to familiar characters.\n\n4. Angers the hardcore fans.\n\nI feel the best decision would have been to option 3, to recast and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy, because it offers a compromise between the profitability (by cashing in on things/characters people already like) and what the hardcore fans who have been there for the long haul hold dear. The route they actually went with, option 4, is in my opinion the worst possible decision they could have made.\n\n**Why I want my view changed**: Simply put, I *want* to see it. I don't really trust Abrams, but given what Disney has done with Marvel, I can't help but think it's going to be good. But if I see it, I feel that I would be betraying what I'm going to call integrity of continuity. People got pissed off when Lucas edited and re-released the Original Trilogy because it changed things they already liked. The edits didn't really add anything to the story, in fact the biggest change took away something, Han shot *first* damn it, and made Lucas tons of money. I feel just like that, except more so.\n\n**Summary**: Star Wars fans had come to terms with there never being an Ep 7 and had turned to other media to take its place. Some of those stories are really great. There were other options for making a seventh movie then making it specifically Ep 7. The decision to make an Ep 7, (a seventh movie that directly follows RotJ) with the same characters and actors was not the best decision as it dismisses some really great material and alienates the most passionate fans.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm a huge Star Wars geek who is unhappy that a new Star Wars movie is being made that wants to be happy that a new Star Wars movie is being made.\n\nEdit: So I've heard many arguments and thought this over. Ultimately, this is the question I'm left with and I'll pose that will change my view. Given what has happened in the lead up to the movie and what we know about it, (EU decertified as canon, Ep 7 taking place in a time period already covered in post RotJ EU, uses the same characters, leading three are portraying the same characters, \"old\" EU may be drawn from as \"inspiration\") what is the main point of making this movie? Is the purpose of making *The Force Awakens* to *meaningfully* contribute to the story, or is it to make money by selling something under a valuable franchise name. While it could do both, one of these is the primary purpose. Given what we already know about the movie, I'm having trouble believing that the primary intent of the movie is to contribute to the story.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Because AFAIK all we have is a short trailer that gives us a *really* **really** short glimpse as to what Ep7 might offer us.  Taking the trailer at face value I have a hard time trying to validate your arguments in general and don't really see any reason to believe that it'll be bad.\n\n&gt; Argument 1\n\nThe problem here is that even though EU had a blessing from Lucas the cannon is ultimately still based off the films and nothing else.

If I am missing out on something, let me know, as it may contribute to changing my view.\n\n**My view**: Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Ep. 7) is, at its core, just an attempt to cash in on a valuable franchise, and doing so is disrespectful to fans of the Star Wars universe.\n\n**Background**\n\n* George Lucas made 6 movies, however good or bad, and denied, up until recently, that there would ever be a 7th movie. These movies represented the highest level of canon in the Universe, no other source contributing to the story of the Universe could contradict the movies. \n\n* Star Wars fans had given up on ever seeing a 7th movie, and thus turned to the next best thing: The Expanded Universe. The meat of the Expanded Universe consists of novels and video games, many of which are considered to be exceptional works in their own right (notably The Thrawn Trilogy, and KOTOR). \n\n* These works created some fantastic stories and characters, many of whom were incorporated into later works which all came together as one coherent, linear timeline.\n\n* However Lucas felt personally about the Expanded Universe, ultimately he was involved in the publication process and had final approval.\n\n* The decision was made to make Ep 7, not just a 7th movie. The characters from the Original Trilogy were to be used, and it was eventually decided that the original actors, (or at least Ford, Hamill, and Fisher) would be involved.\n\n**Arguments**\n\n##Argument 1: It ruins the structure of the timeline, and/or it degrades the value of the Expanded Universe.\n\nFrom a structural standpoint, one of my favorite things about Star Wars is that it is very easy to enter into. There are six movies, and if you want to know what happens after RotJ there is a definitive starting point: Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. There is an order of novels, video games, comic books, and etc that chronologically follow, fit in between, and predate the movie's in the Star Wars Universe's own timeline.\n\nConversely, while I love comic book movies, the multiple timelines, universes, and alternate realities in the source comic books is what prevents me from getting into them, as I don't know or am unable to find a starting point or follow the story lines. \n\nWith the purchase by Disney and the production of the 7th movie, they have relegated almost all of the Expanded Universe to an alternate reality. While the new movies may draw inspiration from these works, ultimately, the source material is no longer considered valid. These are stories that many people have loved, and they're now considered lesser. That bit just really stings. Further, it fragments the Universe's works in a confusing fashion similar to what happened with the classic comic book super heros.\n\nAll further arguments stem from this relegation, if not outright dismissal, of the existing Expanded Universe.\n\n##Argument 2: If additional movies will be made, there are other options that could be used that had an original story and didn't override the existing Expanded Universe then an Ep. 7 that follows closely after RotJ.\n\nThe Expanded Universe, and Lucas himself, has made it clear that it is okay to go beyond the scope of time consisting of the Original Trilogy. The Original Trilogy encompasses roughly a 4 year period. The Prequel Trilogy jumps back 32 years and then encompasses an ~14 year span, with a 10 year jump between TPM and AotC. Further, the Expanded Universe has made major jumps both forward and back, with KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 taking place roughly 4,000 years before ANH, and the Legacy books starting 130 years after ANH, both of which have met with success.\n\n##Argument 3: If an Ep 7 directly following RotJ is to be made, it should adapt a novel(s) from the EU that follows RotJ. \n\nThis decision doesn't alienate the super fans like myself by not trampling all over things they love, but also retains the semi- and casual fans having a concrete and exciting story with characters they already know and love. \n\n##Argument 4: Everything about the decision to make an Ep 7 following RotJ was just wrong.\n\nThe way I see it a 7th Star Wars movie could take one of four routes. The first being what I mentioned in Argument 2, make a movie well outside or not bound by the existing Expanded Universe, thus preserving it. It is now 37 years since ANH. The novels have also encompassed a similar time period. The second route is to use the same actors and jump to a point ~30 years after ANH. The third is to recast the roles and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy. The final decision is to do something completely new, not bound by existing works.\n\nEach decision has it ups. \n\n1. It is unbound by existing stories allowing for creative freedom, and it preserves the existing universe.\n\n2. Will strongly appeal to the hardcore fans that have allowed the franchise to grow. \n\n3. Will appeal to hardcore fans and casuals by using a story familiar to the hardcores and characters familiar to the casuals.\n\n4. Also unbound. \n\nEach decision has its downs. \n\n1. Takes the risk of having a bad story and/or unfamiliar and unappealing character. \n\n2. Would really only do well with the hardcore fans. \n\n3. Could upset, annoy, or confuse people by having unfamiliar faces attached to familiar characters.\n\n4. Angers the hardcore fans.\n\nI feel the best decision would have been to option 3, to recast and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy, because it offers a compromise between the profitability (by cashing in on things/characters people already like) and what the hardcore fans who have been there for the long haul hold dear. The route they actually went with, option 4, is in my opinion the worst possible decision they could have made.\n\n**Why I want my view changed**: Simply put, I *want* to see it. I don't really trust Abrams, but given what Disney has done with Marvel, I can't help but think it's going to be good. But if I see it, I feel that I would be betraying what I'm going to call integrity of continuity. People got pissed off when Lucas edited and re-released the Original Trilogy because it changed things they already liked. The edits didn't really add anything to the story, in fact the biggest change took away something, Han shot *first* damn it, and made Lucas tons of money. I feel just like that, except more so.\n\n**Summary**: Star Wars fans had come to terms with there never being an Ep 7 and had turned to other media to take its place. Some of those stories are really great. There were other options for making a seventh movie then making it specifically Ep 7. The decision to make an Ep 7, (a seventh movie that directly follows RotJ) with the same characters and actors was not the best decision as it dismisses some really great material and alienates the most passionate fans.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm a huge Star Wars geek who is unhappy that a new Star Wars movie is being made that wants to be happy that a new Star Wars movie is being made.\n\nEdit: So I've heard many arguments and thought this over. Ultimately, this is the question I'm left with and I'll pose that will change my view. Given what has happened in the lead up to the movie and what we know about it, (EU decertified as canon, Ep 7 taking place in a time period already covered in post RotJ EU, uses the same characters, leading three are portraying the same characters, \"old\" EU may be drawn from as \"inspiration\") what is the main point of making this movie? Is the purpose of making *The Force Awakens* to *meaningfully* contribute to the story, or is it to make money by selling something under a valuable franchise name. While it could do both, one of these is the primary purpose. Given what we already know about the movie, I'm having trouble believing that the primary intent of the movie is to contribute to the story.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is an order of novels, video games, comic books, and etc that chronologically follow, fit in between, and predate the movie's in the Star Wars Universe's own timeline.\n\nConversely, while I love comic book movies, the multiple timelines, universes, and alternate realities in the source comic books is what prevents me from getting into them, as I don't know or am unable to find a starting point or follow the story lines. \n\nWith the purchase by Disney and the production of the 7th movie, they have relegated almost all of the Expanded Universe to an alternate reality. While the new movies may draw inspiration from these works, ultimately, the source material is no longer considered valid. These are stories that many people have loved, and they're now considered lesser. That bit just really stings. Further, it fragments the Universe's works in a confusing fashion similar to what happened with the classic comic book super heros.\n\nAll further arguments stem from this relegation, if not outright dismissal, of the existing Expanded Universe.\n\n##Argument 2: If additional movies will be made, there are other options that could be used that had an original story and didn't override the existing Expanded Universe then an Ep. 7 that follows closely after RotJ.\n\nThe Expanded Universe, and Lucas himself, has made it clear that it is okay to go beyond the scope of time consisting of the Original Trilogy. The Original Trilogy encompasses roughly a 4 year period. The Prequel Trilogy jumps back 32 years and then encompasses an ~14 year span, with a 10 year jump between TPM and AotC. Further, the Expanded Universe has made major jumps both forward and back, with KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 taking place roughly 4,000 years before ANH, and the Legacy books starting 130 years after ANH, both of which have met with success.\n\n##Argument 3: If an Ep 7 directly following RotJ is to be made, it should adapt a novel(s) from the EU that follows RotJ. \n\nThis decision doesn't alienate the super fans like myself by not trampling all over things they love, but also retains the semi- and casual fans having a concrete and exciting story with characters they already know and love. \n\n##Argument 4: Everything about the decision to make an Ep 7 following RotJ was just wrong.\n\nThe way I see it a 7th Star Wars movie could take one of four routes. The first being what I mentioned in Argument 2, make a movie well outside or not bound by the existing Expanded Universe, thus preserving it. It is now 37 years since ANH. The novels have also encompassed a similar time period. The second route is to use the same actors and jump to a point ~30 years after ANH. The third is to recast the roles and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy. The final decision is to do something completely new, not bound by existing works.\n\nEach decision has it ups. \n\n1. It is unbound by existing stories allowing for creative freedom, and it preserves the existing universe.\n\n2. Will strongly appeal to the hardcore fans that have allowed the franchise to grow. \n\n3. Will appeal to hardcore fans and casuals by using a story familiar to the hardcores and characters familiar to the casuals.\n\n4. Also unbound. \n\nEach decision has its downs. \n\n1. Takes the risk of having a bad story and/or unfamiliar and unappealing character. \n\n2. Would really only do well with the hardcore fans. \n\n3. Could upset, annoy, or confuse people by having unfamiliar faces attached to familiar characters.\n\n4. Angers the hardcore fans.\n\nI feel the best decision would have been to option 3, to recast and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy, because it offers a compromise between the profitability (by cashing in on things/characters people already like) and what the hardcore fans who have been there for the long haul hold dear. The route they actually went with, option 4, is in my opinion the worst possible decision they could have made.\n\n**Why I want my view changed**: Simply put, I *want* to see it. I don't really trust Abrams, but given what Disney has done with Marvel, I can't help but think it's going to be good. But if I see it, I feel that I would be betraying what I'm going to call integrity of continuity. People got pissed off when Lucas edited and re-released the Original Trilogy because it changed things they already liked. The edits didn't really add anything to the story, in fact the biggest change took away something, Han shot *first* damn it, and made Lucas tons of money. I feel just like that, except more so.\n\n**Summary**: Star Wars fans had come to terms with there never being an Ep 7 and had turned to other media to take its place. Some of those stories are really great. There were other options for making a seventh movie then making it specifically Ep 7. The decision to make an Ep 7, (a seventh movie that directly follows RotJ) with the same characters and actors was not the best decision as it dismisses some really great material and alienates the most passionate fans.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm a huge Star Wars geek who is unhappy that a new Star Wars movie is being made that wants to be happy that a new Star Wars movie is being made.\n\nEdit: So I've heard many arguments and thought this over. Ultimately, this is the question I'm left with and I'll pose that will change my view. Given what has happened in the lead up to the movie and what we know about it, (EU decertified as canon, Ep 7 taking place in a time period already covered in post RotJ EU, uses the same characters, leading three are portraying the same characters, \"old\" EU may be drawn from as \"inspiration\") what is the main point of making this movie? Is the purpose of making *The Force Awakens* to *meaningfully* contribute to the story, or is it to make money by selling something under a valuable franchise name. While it could do both, one of these is the primary purpose. Given what we already know about the movie, I'm having trouble believing that the primary intent of the movie is to contribute to the story.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If I am missing out on something, let me know, as it may contribute to changing my view.\n\n**My view**: Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Ep. 7) is, at its core, just an attempt to cash in on a valuable franchise, and doing so is disrespectful to fans of the Star Wars universe.\n\n**Background**\n\n* George Lucas made 6 movies, however good or bad, and denied, up until recently, that there would ever be a 7th movie. These movies represented the highest level of canon in the Universe, no other source contributing to the story of the Universe could contradict the movies. \n\n* Star Wars fans had given up on ever seeing a 7th movie, and thus turned to the next best thing: The Expanded Universe. The meat of the Expanded Universe consists of novels and video games, many of which are considered to be exceptional works in their own right (notably The Thrawn Trilogy, and KOTOR). \n\n* These works created some fantastic stories and characters, many of whom were incorporated into later works which all came together as one coherent, linear timeline.\n\n* However Lucas felt personally about the Expanded Universe, ultimately he was involved in the publication process and had final approval.\n\n* The decision was made to make Ep 7, not just a 7th movie. The characters from the Original Trilogy were to be used, and it was eventually decided that the original actors, (or at least Ford, Hamill, and Fisher) would be involved.\n\n**Arguments**\n\n##Argument 1: It ruins the structure of the timeline, and/or it degrades the value of the Expanded Universe.\n\nFrom a structural standpoint, one of my favorite things about Star Wars is that it is very easy to enter into. There are six movies, and if you want to know what happens after RotJ there is a definitive starting point: Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. There is an order of novels, video games, comic books, and etc that chronologically follow, fit in between, and predate the movie's in the Star Wars Universe's own timeline.\n\nConversely, while I love comic book movies, the multiple timelines, universes, and alternate realities in the source comic books is what prevents me from getting into them, as I don't know or am unable to find a starting point or follow the story lines. \n\nWith the purchase by Disney and the production of the 7th movie, they have relegated almost all of the Expanded Universe to an alternate reality. While the new movies may draw inspiration from these works, ultimately, the source material is no longer considered valid. These are stories that many people have loved, and they're now considered lesser. That bit just really stings. Further, it fragments the Universe's works in a confusing fashion similar to what happened with the classic comic book super heros.\n\nAll further arguments stem from this relegation, if not outright dismissal, of the existing Expanded Universe.\n\n##Argument 2: If additional movies will be made, there are other options that could be used that had an original story and didn't override the existing Expanded Universe then an Ep. 7 that follows closely after RotJ.\n\nThe Expanded Universe, and Lucas himself, has made it clear that it is okay to go beyond the scope of time consisting of the Original Trilogy. The Original Trilogy encompasses roughly a 4 year period. The Prequel Trilogy jumps back 32 years and then encompasses an ~14 year span, with a 10 year jump between TPM and AotC. Further, the Expanded Universe has made major jumps both forward and back, with KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 taking place roughly 4,000 years before ANH, and the Legacy books starting 130 years after ANH, both of which have met with success.\n\n##Argument 3: If an Ep 7 directly following RotJ is to be made, it should adapt a novel(s) from the EU that follows RotJ. \n\nThis decision doesn't alienate the super fans like myself by not trampling all over things they love, but also retains the semi- and casual fans having a concrete and exciting story with characters they already know and love. \n\n##Argument 4: Everything about the decision to make an Ep 7 following RotJ was just wrong.\n\nThe way I see it a 7th Star Wars movie could take one of four routes. The first being what I mentioned in Argument 2, make a movie well outside or not bound by the existing Expanded Universe, thus preserving it. It is now 37 years since ANH. The novels have also encompassed a similar time period. The second route is to use the same actors and jump to a point ~30 years after ANH. The third is to recast the roles and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy. The final decision is to do something completely new, not bound by existing works.\n\nEach decision has it ups. \n\n1. It is unbound by existing stories allowing for creative freedom, and it preserves the existing universe.\n\n2. Will strongly appeal to the hardcore fans that have allowed the franchise to grow. \n\n3. Will appeal to hardcore fans and casuals by using a story familiar to the hardcores and characters familiar to the casuals.\n\n4. Also unbound. \n\nEach decision has its downs. \n\n1. Takes the risk of having a bad story and/or unfamiliar and unappealing character. \n\n2. Would really only do well with the hardcore fans. \n\n3. Could upset, annoy, or confuse people by having unfamiliar faces attached to familiar characters.\n\n4. Angers the hardcore fans.\n\nI feel the best decision would have been to option 3, to recast and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy, because it offers a compromise between the profitability (by cashing in on things/characters people already like) and what the hardcore fans who have been there for the long haul hold dear. The route they actually went with, option 4, is in my opinion the worst possible decision they could have made.\n\n**Why I want my view changed**: Simply put, I *want* to see it. I don't really trust Abrams, but given what Disney has done with Marvel, I can't help but think it's going to be good. But if I see it, I feel that I would be betraying what I'm going to call integrity of continuity.

There are six movies, and if you want to know what happens after RotJ there is a definitive starting point: Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. There is an order of novels, video games, comic books, and etc that chronologically follow, fit in between, and predate the movie's in the Star Wars Universe's own timeline.\n\nConversely, while I love comic book movies, the multiple timelines, universes, and alternate realities in the source comic books is what prevents me from getting into them, as I don't know or am unable to find a starting point or follow the story lines. \n\nWith the purchase by Disney and the production of the 7th movie, they have relegated almost all of the Expanded Universe to an alternate reality. While the new movies may draw inspiration from these works, ultimately, the source material is no longer considered valid. These are stories that many people have loved, and they're now considered lesser. That bit just really stings. Further, it fragments the Universe's works in a confusing fashion similar to what happened with the classic comic book super heros.\n\nAll further arguments stem from this relegation, if not outright dismissal, of the existing Expanded Universe.\n\n##Argument 2: If additional movies will be made, there are other options that could be used that had an original story and didn't override the existing Expanded Universe then an Ep. 7 that follows closely after RotJ.\n\nThe Expanded Universe, and Lucas himself, has made it clear that it is okay to go beyond the scope of time consisting of the Original Trilogy. The Original Trilogy encompasses roughly a 4 year period. The Prequel Trilogy jumps back 32 years and then encompasses an ~14 year span, with a 10 year jump between TPM and AotC. Further, the Expanded Universe has made major jumps both forward and back, with KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 taking place roughly 4,000 years before ANH, and the Legacy books starting 130 years after ANH, both of which have met with success.\n\n##Argument 3: If an Ep 7 directly following RotJ is to be made, it should adapt a novel(s) from the EU that follows RotJ. \n\nThis decision doesn't alienate the super fans like myself by not trampling all over things they love, but also retains the semi- and casual fans having a concrete and exciting story with characters they already know and love. \n\n##Argument 4: Everything about the decision to make an Ep 7 following RotJ was just wrong.\n\nThe way I see it a 7th Star Wars movie could take one of four routes. The first being what I mentioned in Argument 2, make a movie well outside or not bound by the existing Expanded Universe, thus preserving it. It is now 37 years since ANH. The novels have also encompassed a similar time period. The second route is to use the same actors and jump to a point ~30 years after ANH. The third is to recast the roles and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy. The final decision is to do something completely new, not bound by existing works.\n\nEach decision has it ups. \n\n1. It is unbound by existing stories allowing for creative freedom, and it preserves the existing universe.\n\n2. Will strongly appeal to the hardcore fans that have allowed the franchise to grow. \n\n3. Will appeal to hardcore fans and casuals by using a story familiar to the hardcores and characters familiar to the casuals.\n\n4. Also unbound. \n\nEach decision has its downs. \n\n1.

The route they actually went with, option 4, is in my opinion the worst possible decision they could have made.\n\n**Why I want my view changed**: Simply put, I *want* to see it. I don't really trust Abrams, but given what Disney has done with Marvel, I can't help but think it's going to be good. But if I see it, I feel that I would be betraying what I'm going to call integrity of continuity. People got pissed off when Lucas edited and re-released the Original Trilogy because it changed things they already liked. The edits didn't really add anything to the story, in fact the biggest change took away something, Han shot *first* damn it, and made Lucas tons of money. I feel just like that, except more so.\n\n**Summary**: Star Wars fans had come to terms with there never being an Ep 7 and had turned to other media to take its place. Some of those stories are really great. There were other options for making a seventh movie then making it specifically Ep 7. The decision to make an Ep 7, (a seventh movie that directly follows RotJ) with the same characters and actors was not the best decision as it dismisses some really great material and alienates the most passionate fans.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm a huge Star Wars geek who is unhappy that a new Star Wars movie is being made that wants to be happy that a new Star Wars movie is being made.\n\nEdit: So I've heard many arguments and thought this over. Ultimately, this is the question I'm left with and I'll pose that will change my view. Given what has happened in the lead up to the movie and what we know about it, (EU decertified as canon, Ep 7 taking place in a time period already covered in post RotJ EU, uses the same characters, leading three are portraying the same characters, \"old\" EU may be drawn from as \"inspiration\") what is the main point of making this movie? Is the purpose of making *The Force Awakens* to *meaningfully* contribute to the story, or is it to make money by selling something under a valuable franchise name. While it could do both, one of these is the primary purpose. Given what we already know about the movie, I'm having trouble believing that the primary intent of the movie is to contribute to the story.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You claim it discredits a lot of things the community has come to love, but what does that have to do with it being \"just a money grab\"?\n\nIt sounds like you're arguing against seeing it rather than Disney being greedy which is what I assumed this would be about.\n\nFor the sake of the title I'll change your view on the money grab thing before anything about the EU.\n\nI don't personally believe it's a money grab for several reasons, mainly being because of who is in charge. Episodes 1-3 were money grabs and the re-releases with Lucas's special touches were too. Now that Lucas isn't in control and Disney is, Disney won't be putting in Hasbro-esque creatures to sell as toys since they're already rich off their ass from Marvel. J.J. Abrams has also worked wonders with Star Trek, so I trust him not to let any sort of potential minor Disney-greed exist or be as obvious as it was in Ep.s 1-3.\n\nDisney really has no reason to make this into a money grab with the several phases of Marvel movies pre-planned and already being filmed. Ant-Man was just finished being filmed, and I'm pretty sure that won't be released for at least another year, so Disney really doesn't need to worry about racking in money.\n\nAlso, not sure if anyone mentioned this, they planned a TRILOGY. Not just Episode 7, but Episodes 7-9. Lucas originally planned 12 movies split into trilogies, then 9, then 1 movie which would combine two and if it did well he'd make sequels and then go back and make prequels with the potential for another sequel trilogy. The first would have to do with philosophy, the prequels would do with politics, and the third would do with morals or something (maybe I'm confused the first and third trilogies but I remember hearing this somewhere, sorry no source)\n\nFor your complaints on the expanded universe- the EU still exists. To me it was always some sort of giant fanfiction the community built up. I enjoyed small parts of it, playing through Jedi Academy for PC many times since I loved the time period and playthrough, but I never took it TOO seriously. I'm obviously not apart of the die-hard EU demographic you're referencing, but in the end, the movies are the law. I understand it may ruin some EU things, or a lot of EU things, but it also allows for even more EU to come after this trilogy is done.\n\nJ.J. Abrams likes Star Wars, even growing up, and he never even liked Star Trek he was just good at directing it. So again, Abrams wouldn't really screw this up. He's apart of the Star Wars community like anyone else and wants to expand on what is the story of the main universe, or, the movies. This trilogy will probably be much more interesting than 1-3, so I'm very excited for it."}, {"id": "2okkgu", "body": "**Disclaimer**: I have actively avoided media on the new Star Wars movie as an act of protest.

The characters from the Original Trilogy were to be used, and it was eventually decided that the original actors, (or at least Ford, Hamill, and Fisher) would be involved.\n\n**Arguments**\n\n##Argument 1: It ruins the structure of the timeline, and/or it degrades the value of the Expanded Universe.\n\nFrom a structural standpoint, one of my favorite things about Star Wars is that it is very easy to enter into. There are six movies, and if you want to know what happens after RotJ there is a definitive starting point: Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. There is an order of novels, video games, comic books, and etc that chronologically follow, fit in between, and predate the movie's in the Star Wars Universe's own timeline.\n\nConversely, while I love comic book movies, the multiple timelines, universes, and alternate realities in the source comic books is what prevents me from getting into them, as I don't know or am unable to find a starting point or follow the story lines. \n\nWith the purchase by Disney and the production of the 7th movie, they have relegated almost all of the Expanded Universe to an alternate reality. While the new movies may draw inspiration from these works, ultimately, the source material is no longer considered valid. These are stories that many people have loved, and they're now considered lesser. That bit just really stings. Further, it fragments the Universe's works in a confusing fashion similar to what happened with the classic comic book super heros.\n\nAll further arguments stem from this relegation, if not outright dismissal, of the existing Expanded Universe.\n\n##Argument 2: If additional movies will be made, there are other options that could be used that had an original story and didn't override the existing Expanded Universe then an Ep. 7 that follows closely after RotJ.\n\nThe Expanded Universe, and Lucas himself, has made it clear that it is okay to go beyond the scope of time consisting of the Original Trilogy. The Original Trilogy encompasses roughly a 4 year period. The Prequel Trilogy jumps back 32 years and then encompasses an ~14 year span, with a 10 year jump between TPM and AotC. Further, the Expanded Universe has made major jumps both forward and back, with KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 taking place roughly 4,000 years before ANH, and the Legacy books starting 130 years after ANH, both of which have met with success.\n\n##Argument 3: If an Ep 7 directly following RotJ is to be made, it should adapt a novel(s) from the EU that follows RotJ. \n\nThis decision doesn't alienate the super fans like myself by not trampling all over things they love, but also retains the semi- and casual fans having a concrete and exciting story with characters they already know and love. \n\n##Argument 4: Everything about the decision to make an Ep 7 following RotJ was just wrong.\n\nThe way I see it a 7th Star Wars movie could take one of four routes. The first being what I mentioned in Argument 2, make a movie well outside or not bound by the existing Expanded Universe, thus preserving it. It is now 37 years since ANH. The novels have also encompassed a similar time period. The second route is to use the same actors and jump to a point ~30 years after ANH. The third is to recast the roles and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy. The final decision is to do something completely new, not bound by existing works.\n\nEach decision has it ups. \n\n1. It is unbound by existing stories allowing for creative freedom, and it preserves the existing universe.\n\n2. Will strongly appeal to the hardcore fans that have allowed the franchise to grow. \n\n3. Will appeal to hardcore fans and casuals by using a story familiar to the hardcores and characters familiar to the casuals.\n\n4. Also unbound. \n\nEach decision has its downs. \n\n1. Takes the risk of having a bad story and/or unfamiliar and unappealing character. \n\n2. Would really only do well with the hardcore fans. \n\n3. Could upset, annoy, or confuse people by having unfamiliar faces attached to familiar characters.\n\n4. Angers the hardcore fans.\n\nI feel the best decision would have been to option 3, to recast and adapt the Thrawn Trilogy, because it offers a compromise between the profitability (by cashing in on things/characters people already like) and what the hardcore fans who have been there for the long haul hold dear. The route they actually went with, option 4, is in my opinion the worst possible decision they could have made.\n\n**Why I want my view changed**: Simply put, I *want* to see it. I don't really trust Abrams, but given what Disney has done with Marvel, I can't help but think it's going to be good. But if I see it, I feel that I would be betraying what I'm going to call integrity of continuity. People got pissed off when Lucas edited and re-released the Original Trilogy because it changed things they already liked. The edits didn't really add anything to the story, in fact the biggest change took away something, Han shot *first* damn it, and made Lucas tons of money. I feel just like that, except more so.\n\n**Summary**: Star Wars fans had come to terms with there never being an Ep 7 and had turned to other media to take its place. Some of those stories are really great. There were other options for making a seventh movie then making it specifically Ep 7. The decision to make an Ep 7, (a seventh movie that directly follows RotJ) with the same characters and actors was not the best decision as it dismisses some really great material and alienates the most passionate fans.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm a huge Star Wars geek who is unhappy that a new Star Wars movie is being made that wants to be happy that a new Star Wars movie is being made.\n\nEdit: So I've heard many arguments and thought this over. Ultimately, this is the question I'm left with and I'll pose that will change my view. Given what has happened in the lead up to the movie and what we know about it, (EU decertified as canon, Ep 7 taking place in a time period already covered in post RotJ EU, uses the same characters, leading three are portraying the same characters, \"old\" EU may be drawn from as \"inspiration\") what is the main point of making this movie? Is the purpose of making *The Force Awakens* to *meaningfully* contribute to the story, or is it to make money by selling something under a valuable franchise name. While it could do both, one of these is the primary purpose. Given what we already know about the movie, I'm having trouble believing that the primary intent of the movie is to contribute to the story.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Here's why:\n\nI've been spending quite a bit of time over at /r/teachers and r/education, and the stories they have to share are nothing short of depressing. A lot of teachers hate their jobs and hate their lives because of the sheer amount of work they put in, and the pitiful compensation that they get in return. I ask them why they still do it, and they say that it's for the students. \"If they dropped everything and walked out, who would be there to teach the kids?\"\n\nMy argument is that eating the poo that gets flung at them by politicians, administrations, and parents does a lot more harm than good in the long run. If teachers threatened to walk, it would force long-term changes to be implemented, better helping students in the future at the expense of students in the present. If we keep the same practices we have today, then that will just continue the downward spiral we're seeing as more and more teachers leave the profession in just under 5 years. If we continue the trend, who's going to teach our children ten years from now? Who the fuck wants to be a teacher under this political climate?\n\nAnother argument I keep hearing is how \"Only the best and brightest teachers will show up to work under such miserable conditions.\" It's so funny how that logic is absent when applied to careers with fat-cat salaries. Just because you enjoy your job or are good at it does NOT mean you should do it for free.

I took this personally and my mentor teacher (who is considered the best teacher in the area) said that no matter how hard you try and how much you care it is just impossible to get through to some students.

Well Jimmy failed science class because Jimmy didn't do his homework and got zeroes for each assignment he missed. Jimmy didn't study so he failed his test which was 70% of his grade. The teacher can't raise the kid when he's not in the classroom. That's the parents' job.\n\nSource: I was a high school student several years ago. I had standard curriculum classes where every day teachers would put their best foot forward only to get mud thrown in their face by the students who didn't care. The AP curriculum, however, was completely different. The students were far more willing to learn and actively engage the teacher. It's possible that each and every student was genetically superior to their counterparts in the standard curriculum, but I think its far more likely that their parents were simply more involved in their child's school life."}, {"id": "cmow98o", "body": "\u201cOur youth now love luxury.

Here's why:\n\nI've been spending quite a bit of time over at /r/teachers and r/education, and the stories they have to share are nothing short of depressing. A lot of teachers hate their jobs and hate their lives because of the sheer amount of work they put in, and the pitiful compensation that they get in return. I ask them why they still do it, and they say that it's for the students. \"If they dropped everything and walked out, who would be there to teach the kids?\"\n\nMy argument is that eating the poo that gets flung at them by politicians, administrations, and parents does a lot more harm than good in the long run. If teachers threatened to walk, it would force long-term changes to be implemented, better helping students in the future at the expense of students in the present. If we keep the same practices we have today, then that will just continue the downward spiral we're seeing as more and more teachers leave the profession in just under 5 years. If we continue the trend, who's going to teach our children ten years from now? Who the fuck wants to be a teacher under this political climate?\n\nAnother argument I keep hearing is how \"Only the best and brightest teachers will show up to work under such miserable conditions.\" It's so funny how that logic is absent when applied to careers with fat-cat salaries. Just because you enjoy your job or are good at it does NOT mean you should do it for free. I'd like to see what politicians would think if you paid them a 32k/year salary and then told them they're passion for lawmaking is good enough.\n\nChange My View"}, {"id": "cmnyn87", "body": "I agree with your point that teachers are grossly underpaid and misunderstood but I disagree with your Solution.

My point was that the OP seemed to be asking \"why does everyone like him when I don't\", which is why I talked about tastes.  The way it's written is a fact - it's how different readers respond to him that changes.

Hell, many popular writers use the same characters or situations.  \n\n&gt;but the story can still utilize the most basic, essential rule of good writing: show, don't tell.\n\nFor the OP, and apparently you, the dialog doesn't ring true.

I think it works - you don't.\n\nI'm sorry you thought I was dismissing the OP's evaluation.  My reading of her post was that she was uncomfortable about liking John Green (the vlogger) but not liking John Green (the author).
