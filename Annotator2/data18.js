The way I see it, while developing specific breeds at one point made sense because dogs served different functions, at this point it's doing more harm (in the form of inbreeding and creating a market for irresponsible overbreeding) than good and doesn't need to be practiced any more. \n\n\n\n**Wanting a dog with a specific personality // need a specific breed for a specific job**\n\nDisposition and manners are going to have a lot more to do with upbringing, imo, than species. Obviously that's a generalization, as something like energy level cannot be trained out of a dog. But it's pretty easy to gauge things like that in a dog whose bloodline you don't know by just hanging out with them a little- terrier/shepherd looking dogs that are bouncing off the walls are probably going to be high energy. That doesn't require a pedigree to determine. Similarly, I can't think of a reason why a service dog would need to be 100% of a specific breed. Looking for a general type of dog makes sense, but why you would need a purebred lab and couldn't make do with a lab-x from a shelter is beyond me. Mutts are intelligent and trainable and possess the physical attributes required of any dog job. Not all of them, obviously, but not all purebred dogs are cut out to be police / service / drug dogs either. The training and weeding out process is in place regardless, there's no reason a mutt couldn't go through it and I'd be willing to bet just as many would come out on the other side as the pure dogs.\n\n\n\n**Purebreed for the purpose of keeping a breed in existence // breeding for show** \n\nThese are not wild animals which humans have been killing off via habitat loss and poaching. Specific breeds were created by man, and it's cruel and unnecessary to inbreed them to the point of mental and physical illness for the purpose of maintaining some man-made breed standard. Dog shows seems superficial and meaningless to me and nobody's ever been able to articulate a reason why they aren't.\n\n\n\nI get liking a particular look. My family has two little mutts and I love them to bits but fantasize about getting a Great Dane when I'm out of university. However, I really can't conceive of a reason why I'd need to ensure that a dog I'd adopt was 100% Dane to satisfy that desire. I'll visit a bunch of pounds and find a Dane-ish looking dog, or go to a Dane rescue, and be ecstatic with whatever doggy I find.\n\nPlease change my view so I can be more empathetic when people tell me they got their dog from a purebred breeder and I won't secretly judge them anymore!\n\n\n*edit: formatting*\n\nEDIT: My view's been changed!

I wouldn't even know the statistics but if I had to guess it's a single digit percentage.  However, just because you've never known someone to need a dog because of a task doesn't mean they don't exist.  Case in point, my dad's dogs were Labs and Brittanies for bird hunting.  He chose it based on a function, and also as a good family pet.  Another example would be police dogs, they get certain breeds as trackers, certain breeds for K-9 units, etc.  Those are work dogs and not pets.  Another example of work dogs would be sled dogs, who's sole purpose is essentially to race.  They are not the kinds of dogs you'd buy as a family pet since they're more like undomesticated pack animals than a lovable cuddler.\n\n&gt; I think it's sort of conceited to pretend you need a 100% pure dog bred for centuries for hunting to accompany you during open season. I could make due with a generally hunting-type dog that's been trained properly, even if his ears weren't crafted for optimal listening. \n\nIt goes back to the kinda-sorta problem.  If you only have kinda-sorta dogs, then eventually through natural breeding you lose a lot of the traits that you wanted in the first place.  You're going to have litters that show other traits, or repress the ones you're after.  There will come a point that without specific breeding you won't be able to find what you're looking for, or it'll be present but not accentuated enough to be as effective as you'd like.\n\n&gt; In fairness, I also think it's conceited to think you need the highest quality luxury car or furniture or clothes. \n\nSo it's conceited that someone wants a BMW over a Civic?  Do you judge people because they have a nice house or a nice car?  Can we just not have nice things?  Can we not have a pure bred toy dog because we think they look adorable in our Coach bag in the passenger seat of a Mercedes?\n\n&gt; I like Danes because they're both huge and lazy, and I think quite handsome, and I know perfectly well I can find those traits in a dog whose bloodline hasn't been carefully cultivated for centuries. \n\nAgain, it doesn't need to be 100% for it to look and act like a Dane, but eventually if you don't control breeds there will be no Danes.  You'll just have mutts.  Everything that makes a Dane a Dane will be evened out with every other dog breed to the point where its just a dog.  And again, if I told you that Pomeranian was 10% Dane, would you accept it as a Dane?\n\n&gt; But the line is crossed for me with living animals, I think it's selfish to get a purebreed because you think you need it, when you could be giving a home to a rescue or shelter pup and giving the extra couple grand you've saved to the SPCA or something. \n\nBut if I want a certain kind of dog then what's wrong with getting what I want?  I don't want something that looks like a terrier, or a lab, or a rottie, or a shepard.  I want a Shiba, or a Corgi.  So what's wrong with me going and getting what I want?\n\n&gt; And in the case of short muzzled dogs like pugs and bulldogs, contributing to the demand that causes them to continue to be bred a certain way despite clear health problems is all the more blatantly irresponsible.\n\nThis I'll can kinda agree to, because certain breeds do have issues to the point where it's only hurting the dog.  However this isn't the case with many kinds of purebreeds.  From a genetic standpoint, abnormalities and genetic diseases can be avoided with careful breeding practices.

She is, however, a terrible gun dog. Taking her hunting would be valuable only for comedic purposes. \n\nThere are really several ways to ensure a hypoallergenic dog. You need to understand that first, most people are allergic to dander. So you can start with breed -- choose a breed known to produce less dander or trap it better in their coat (usually a curly hair type like a poodle.) You also need to choose a breed that is not known for skin issues. IMO, a slightly greasier dog like a lab or a neufie mix will do better than a drier breed such as a GSD or Huskie mix. However, just choosing your dog wisely not enough to keep your dog hypoallergenic (and please remember, hypoallergenic doesn't mean that your dog triggers NO allergies, it just means that they trigger LESS of an allergic response.)\n\nIf step one is choosing a dog that is less likely to shed dander, then step two is producing less dander. This is achieved through better diet. A dog on a very healthy diet will have less flaky, dry, itchy skin. In turn, less dander. They also smell loads better. A gassy dog is a dander-y dog. I feed Taste of the Wild and have had NO dander issues. Most zero-grain dog foods will clear up dander patches. \n\nStep three is dander management. Grooming outside will remove dander trapped in the coat and keep it from being inside. Regular vacuuming and washing of soft furnishing and carpets will remove dander from the home. Finally, regular bathing of the dog, when done right, will help manage dander and skin irritation, but you need to use a very gentle shampoo that doesn't dry out the skin.\n\nWith Yootilla, I chose a dog that had almost a minky coat, I feed her a high-quality, grain-free diet and I bath her about every 2-3 weeks. She gets brushed in the sunlight when we have the cahnce, which distributes her coat oils evenly, which helps her skin to be smooth, silky and just the right balance between greasy and dry. My friend that usually has a pretty remarkable reaction to dogs, does quite well around her.\n\nNow, some people are unfortunately allergic to dog spit, as I understand it.

They are the type of breeders who are concerned chiefly with looks and making a profit, and they often \"breed\" by simply taking two purebred dogs who look good and let them have at it until they get a litter of puppies. Then they'll sell the puppies for $200-$300 each for a quick profit; after that, they usually aren't concerned what happens to them.\n\nResponsible breeders, on the other hand, typically have medical records and ancestry information on all of their dogs. They will be able to provide you with that history, allow you to meet the dogs, and are typically very selective with who they allow to purchase a dog. They breed either for sporting (such as hunting, sledding) or showing, or competitions like obedience and agility, as well as getting dogs with a certain temperament. They will often require you to sign a contract requiring you to spay or neuter the pet within a certain timeframe, and agree that if for any reason you cannot care for the dog, you must give it back to the breeder. These people are not concerned with profit; although dogs from these breeders are very expensive (some can be over $1000), they do not make a profit, because of the amount of time and money that goes into planning each litter; any dog that has any indication of a genetic defect would certainly not be bred, because the point of breeding (for a reputable breeder) is to continue and improve the breed, not to create as many as possible. I think most would agree that there is no obvious negative to the idea of breeding to create healthier, more well-mannered dogs.\n\nThe main issue is that some people who have no idea what they are doing; the issue isn't the breeds themselves--these diseases and defects would exist, regardless of what we call each dog that looks a certain way--the issue is that people, who do not know if their dogs have a history of these illnesses, think that they can breed them simply because they are healthy and asthetically pleasing."}, {"id": "2p6y53", "body": "Genuinely looking for a good reason why some people are so caught up in the purity of their dog's blood line, cause I'm just not getting it.

A frog is going to act very differently from a dog even if you raise them the same way.  Even so, it's not accurate.  While it's true that individuals among breeds can have huge personality overlap the idea falls apart when you examine larger populations.  Bassett hounds as a group are far more likely to display scenting instincts than border collies.  That's the point of a standard.\n\nNow you may say \"so what?

Most dogs are bought as puppies before their physical or personality development is complete.  To place dogs in appropriate homes it's *crucial* to be able to predict their energy levels, instinctive behaviours, size and other factors.  The best way to achieve predictability is to have a known pedigree and standardization.

And in that sense, I agree it is destructive\n\nSecondly: my parents breed working Labradors for upland bird and waterfowl hunting, so I am biased (but also know a lot about what they do).  \n\nHere's where our opinions part ways. As to your first point, if you want to maintain a trait found in a specific breed, you have to continue the breed, which implies selective breeding. So it's not just about improvement, but maintenance. And some breed traits are VERY important and very, very difficult to find out of the breed. In particular, the \"working instincts\" that lead dogs to herd sheep, retrieve with a soft mouth, flush, point, and so on, are truly instincts in that they are not trained, only honed by the trainer. Our Lab puppies will point when they scent a pheasant at about 10 weeks of age, without ever being taught. Adult dogs without that instinct frequently can never be trained to do it. Try to sift through thousands of shelter dogs to find one that has that instinct and you're going to have a bad time. \n\nSecondly, working (or formerly working) dog breeds have conformation and pedigree requirements designed around making sure they are at peak working condition. At dog shows they check for much more than height, weight, etc., they are looking for correct alignment of muscles and bones to reduce stress and injuries, correct body shape and attributes for certain jobs (i.e. Labradors are compact and muscular; with a dense waterproof undercoat for swimming in cold water, Border collies are streamlined and low to the ground for making quick turns), good temperament, tractability, intelligence, and the list goes on. Non-showing breeders are the same. My parents have about one litter a year and are hyper-focused on conformation, temperament, health, \"duck sense\" and intelligence. This is true of responsible breeders across the board. There is a reason Border collies win such a crazy high percentage of sheepdog and agility trials: because they are bred to be the best, and breeders haven't let that standard slip. \n\nI'm not claiming every breeder or every breed has their eye on the prize in this way. There are definitely problems in the breeding industry exacerbated by people wanting the wrong pets for the wrong reason. But it's not ALL breeders, and the ones who don't are actually getting something out of their dogs you can't get out of a mutt.

However there are a number of truly valid reasons to pirate content and really the movie studios are as much to blame for piracy as is the human instinct to be cheap.\n\nI am about to go on a rant about how they have been trying to screw their customers for the last three decades and now go crying to the government because they are losing - and I apologize in advance.\n\nFirst when you go out and buy a DVD the studio insists on wasting a minute of your time with each viewing showing you FBI warnings about piracy.  I just bought the god damn dvd i am not a pirate!\n\nSecond sometimes they force you to watch trailers for other films before you can watch the movie you PAID for.  This is stealing your time and free advertising revenue from consumers we never agreed to.  If i knew a dvd was going to force me to watch a trailer for something else before i could watch the movie itself i wouldn't buy it on general principle.\n\nThird I am not really buying a DVD as a physical thing - I am buying a copy of the movie.  I want to be able to watch my copy of the movie on my computer, my smart phone, my xbox, whatever.  If I have a slick home theater set-up I want to be able to rip a copy of the movie onto my computer's hard drive so i can pull it up digitally rather than put the disk in the player to start the film.  The movie studios have done everything they can to lock this down and prevent me from making a fair use of the product I have paid for.\n\nForth the studios have been inserting anti-piracy crap into their disks that occassionally prevent me from even watching content.  My first dvd player couldn't output to a TV by RCA cables.  The picture was all weird and distorted and I couldn't figure out why for days.  Turns out that while they had an RCA out it wouldn't friggin work!  I had to use the S-video output and buy a new cable (and a new tv as my existing one didn't have an svideo in).  Think about that for a minute.  A consumer buys your product, reads the specs, and then you don't deliver the goods and force them to buy new hardware even though it ought to have been compatible.\n\nFifth depending on where you are you can't even legally purchase these SOBs content.  There are so many shows and movies that they just don't sell digitally in canada that it is crazy.\n\nSixth they try to bundle the stuff i want to see to other stuff and jack up the price.

However there are a number of truly valid reasons to pirate content and really the movie studios are as much to blame for piracy as is the human instinct to be cheap.\n\nI am about to go on a rant about how they have been trying to screw their customers for the last three decades and now go crying to the government because they are losing - and I apologize in advance.\n\nFirst when you go out and buy a DVD the studio insists on wasting a minute of your time with each viewing showing you FBI warnings about piracy.  I just bought the god damn dvd i am not a pirate!\n\nSecond sometimes they force you to watch trailers for other films before you can watch the movie you PAID for.  This is stealing your time and free advertising revenue from consumers we never agreed to.  If i knew a dvd was going to force me to watch a trailer for something else before i could watch the movie itself i wouldn't buy it on general principle.\n\nThird I am not really buying a DVD as a physical thing - I am buying a copy of the movie.  I want to be able to watch my copy of the movie on my computer, my smart phone, my xbox, whatever.  If I have a slick home theater set-up I want to be able to rip a copy of the movie onto my computer's hard drive so i can pull it up digitally rather than put the disk in the player to start the film.  The movie studios have done everything they can to lock this down and prevent me from making a fair use of the product I have paid for.\n\nForth the studios have been inserting anti-piracy crap into their disks that occassionally prevent me from even watching content.  My first dvd player couldn't output to a TV by RCA cables.  The picture was all weird and distorted and I couldn't figure out why for days.  Turns out that while they had an RCA out it wouldn't friggin work!  I had to use the S-video output and buy a new cable (and a new tv as my existing one didn't have an svideo in).  Think about that for a minute.  A consumer buys your product, reads the specs, and then you don't deliver the goods and force them to buy new hardware even though it ought to have been compatible.\n\nFifth depending on where you are you can't even legally purchase these SOBs content.  There are so many shows and movies that they just don't sell digitally in canada that it is crazy.\n\nSixth they try to bundle the stuff i want to see to other stuff and jack up the price.

The movie studios have done everything they can to lock this down and prevent me from making a fair use of the product I have paid for.\n\nIf you live in country where it's allowed to break DRM then there is no problem making a copy and put it on your HDD but those countries also pays a blank media tax on storage mediums. \n\n&gt;Forth the studios have been inserting anti-piracy crap into their disks that occassionally prevent me from even watching content. My first dvd player couldn't output to a TV by RCA cables. The picture was all weird and distorted and I couldn't figure out why for days. Turns out that while they had an RCA out it wouldn't friggin work! I had to use the S-video output and buy a new cable (and a new tv as my existing one didn't have an svideo in). Think about that for a minute. A consumer buys your product, reads the specs, and then you don't deliver the goods and force them to buy new hardware even though it ought to have been compatible.\n\nHow are the Film Studios responsible for a faulty DVD player?\n\n&gt;Fifth depending on where you are you can't even legally purchase these SOBs content. There are so many shows and movies that they just don't sell digitally in canada that it is crazy.\n\nImportation isn't illegal. Ever asked the rights-holders who actually owns the digital distribution rights for Canada?\n\n&gt;Sixth they try to bundle the stuff i want to see to other stuff and jack up the price. HBO won't let me just buy a subscription to them - I have to buy a cable subscription as well. Well I don't want all that garbage that cable has to offer I just want the sweetness of HBO and am willing to pay for it but the idiots won't shut up and take my money.\n\nCable companies not the Film Studios doing and in countries where HBO is offered as a streaming service, those countries still showed up as 8th and 10th most common location for pirates downloading Game of Thrones."}, {"id": "cmttb72", "body": "No one is going to disagree that movie studios are entitled to a profit from their films (which means consumers have to pay for them).  However there are a number of truly valid reasons to pirate content and really the movie studios are as much to blame for piracy as is the human instinct to be cheap.\n\nI am about to go on a rant about how they have been trying to screw their customers for the last three decades and now go crying to the government because they are losing - and I apologize in advance.\n\nFirst when you go out and buy a DVD the studio insists on wasting a minute of your time with each viewing showing you FBI warnings about piracy.  I just bought the god damn dvd i am not a pirate!\n\nSecond sometimes they force you to watch trailers for other films before you can watch the movie you PAID for.  This is stealing your time and free advertising revenue from consumers we never agreed to.  If i knew a dvd was going to force me to watch a trailer for something else before i could watch the movie itself i wouldn't buy it on general principle.\n\nThird I am not really buying a DVD as a physical thing - I am buying a copy of the movie.  I want to be able to watch my copy of the movie on my computer, my smart phone, my xbox, whatever.  If I have a slick home theater set-up I want to be able to rip a copy of the movie onto my computer's hard drive so i can pull it up digitally rather than put the disk in the player to start the film.  The movie studios have done everything they can to lock this down and prevent me from making a fair use of the product I have paid for.\n\nForth the studios have been inserting anti-piracy crap into their disks that occassionally prevent me from even watching content.  My first dvd player couldn't output to a TV by RCA cables.  The picture was all weird and distorted and I couldn't figure out why for days.

Well I don't want all that garbage that cable has to offer I just want the sweetness of HBO and am willing to pay for it but the idiots won't shut up and take my money.\n\nSo... They have been taking their legitimate product and soaking it in DRM crap making it worse, and worse, and worse, and effectively making the pirated stuff a better quality product.  And after suffering through all those agrevations above am I supposed to feel sorry for Sony when their crap gets stolen?  The mystifying thing to me is that after I wave money in their face to give me what I want, and they refuse to take it, they get all pissy that people will pirate their stuff.  \n\nYes a lot of pirates just do it because they are cheap.  Yes even if these companies were great corporate citizens there would still be piracy.

It's a great time for the theater to make concessions money....)\n\nThe problem with opening up movies to streaming, I think, is that the studios are going to take a huge ego hit when people pause the movie ten minutes in, backtrack out of there and ask for their money back.

There are black market organ trades that are ruthless to their victims. Not only that, but rich people often have better access to health care anyways, meaning that they benefit from it and the poor do not anyways. \n\nPretty much everyone agrees that permitting sales would end the organ shortage - the rebuttals are usually exactly as you put it: the poor end up being exploited. One thing legalizing sales of organs would do is permit a regulatory oversight and add some protection that isn't there now. \n\nThere are multiple different considerations with both legal sales and our current donor system - neither of which are without their problems. The question is which set of problems you want to accept. [Here](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/opinion/why-selling-kidneys-should-be-legal.html?_r=0) is a basic argument for being able to sell organs, including addressing the concern that the poor would be exploited. \n\nI consider it from a much more fundamental level: if you don't own your body (including the right to sell part of it), then you aren't really free. \n\nEdit: [this guy](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/articles/fee/organs.html) says it better than me:\n\n&gt;One concern is that if organs are sold rather donated, poor people couldn't afford them. There's a difference between methods of attaining organs and methods of distributing them. For example, poor people need food but Congress hasn't mandated that food prices be zero so that poor people can eat. If Congress did that, there'd be massive shortages and poor people would probably starve. Instead of such a stupid policy, we simply allow the market mechanism to supply food and then subsidize purchases, through programs like food stamps. That same principle can be applied to organ transplants - allow the market to supply organs and if needed subsidize or provide through charity their distribution...\n\n&gt;Another concern is that if there's a market for organs, poor people will sell their organs and become ill. The proposals made so far provide monetary payments be made for only cadaver organs. But from a strictly ethical point of view, people should be able to dispose of their organs for whatever reason they please. Why? If we agree that people have property rights in themselves, i.e., own themselves, they have a right to dispose of themselves anyway they please so long as they do not violate the property rights of others. I would surely prefer a person who might be unwilling to give me his kidney find motivation to sell me his kidney rather than for me to do without.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmu0352", "body": "So allow people to sell their organs."}, {"id": "cmum2kj", "body": "&gt; Transplantable organ shortages would disappear overnight if people were permitted to sell organs.

Comparing countries that use opt-out policies versus opt-in, we can look to Austria and Germany. There is no question that in 2013, Austria (22.05 dpmp) outperformed Germany (10.71 dpmp) in donation performance two-fold. However, in that same year, for example, three hundred and thirty-seven (337) kidney transplants were performed when six hundred and ninety-four (694) were actually required.\n\nSo, while Austria and Spain, as a matter of fact, lead the world in donation performance at around 22 dpmp, it is far from what is considered to be *breakthrough performance*. An opt-out policy is not the silver bullet.\n\nUsing those same statistics, one also cannot ignore that a \"Eurotransplant zone\" has been constructed and agreed to. Smaller centres benefit, often more than larger centres, from organ sharing agreements. This also contributes to increased donation rates. As does a more homogenous population, I'm afraid. Public investment in education and awareness increases donation rates. ICUs that employ *donation specialists* (MDs who sub-specialize in donation care within CCUs and ICUs) have better rates. Centres who invest in multi-disciplinary transplant programs, of course, by virtue of their efforts will impact donation rates, as well.\n\nI just mean that in North America, unfortunately, opt-out legislation is always the first thing that someone shouts when the topic comes up. But all by itself it does not solve any problems. Probably the most important reality here is that, practically speaking, no surgeon is going to walk into an ICU and declare to your shocked and grieving family, that he or she is there to take your organs for transplant. Even in opt-out countries, the standard of practice is: to support the family; inform of the policy; ask for and honour any objections (i.e., any objection whatsoever and the processes ceases); and, [*for emphasis*] provide care and support to the family and deceased. So, opt-out legislation *requires* that each centre employ and invest-in specialized teams of clinicians to carry out these delicate and deliberate functions (i.e., legislation brings funding.) If opt-in countries did *even that* without enacting legislation, North American donation performance would improve dramatically.\n\nAlso, and it actually plays a role in donation rates sadly, there is still a North American political perception to \"opting-out\" that strikes a slight majority (~51%, in fact) as \"socialism\" - the definition of which, largely thanks to the United States GOP, has been misinterpreted and maligned over the recent generation. Anyways, it makes conservative governments balk at this kind of legislation for no good reason, even amongst Canadian provincial governments."}, {"id": "cmtvn26", "body": "Completely agree with you.\n\nOrgan donation after death only effects the receiver.\n\nBlood donation effects both donator and receiver.

I maintain that I will ALWAYS take such considerations into thought when making any decision, especially one that would take place at a time when my wife would be in emotional distress (i can literally think of no time more traumatic for her than my death). I chose to remove my donor status because I love her. She would ultimately have control over my body anyways, and I wouldn't want Litigations causing her any undue distress after my passing. This, I believe is a very valid reason, far more reasonable than the grossly oversimplified \"grandma thinks it's unnatural\" strawman Ablarga cited.\n\nAs to why I think I should have equal access to donated Organs, the answer was given in my previous post: I don't think it's fair. Regardless of the reason someone opts out of donation, it is a donation. Coercing and threatening aren't valid aspects of donating, you're soliciting. Extortion, some could even say.\n\nDonation is voluntary, and for good reason; healthcare is a right. (in my country, America) the hippoceatic oath means a doctor will treat you to the best of their ability following the order of triage: your personal feeling and desires for your organs are of no concern to a doctor trying to save lives.\n\nShow up to the ER with a headache. \"Sorry sir, you'll have to wait while I sew this man's arm back on\"\n\nHealthcare is prioritized solely by the needs of the patient. No matter their race, creed, age, wealth, orientation or Donor Status, the patient who needs the treatment most, gets the treatment fastest. This is according to the hippocratic oath.\n\nAs for the assumption that this is a free Rider issue, of course it is. Anytime there is a voluntary charity, there will be those who abuse it. But I have to ask: do you honestly think anybody could willingly abuse a system that can only be abused if they're already on death's bed? Are you really gonna tell me my life is less important than a criminal dying of the same disease, just because he agreed to give up his lungs after he dies?\n\nin closing, a thought experiment: an alternative reality for you to reflect upon the removal of Triage from the healthcare system\n\nI've died, and left my organs to my wife. She now has full power over where my mortal remains go, to sell them or donate as she pleases to whichever patient she sees fit. My (or ratjer, her) Heart goes to her grandmother, liver to her alcoholic dad. Kidneys are sold to some rich benefactor for 15 grand each, and my eyes go to a Blind neo-nazi for 2 grand each. The rest goes to scientific research.\n\nin this scenario, i've opted out of donating my organs, but my wife has expressly used me as she wanted, saved the lives of *her* chosen priority, but perhaps also damned the lives of 5 other terminally ill patients.

That's the reason people have funerals and various burial forms and rituals. You could say that since you're dead already, there's no harm in just dumping the body in the ground somewhere where there's space or cutting it to small pieces so there's more space, or getting your barely cold skin cut down, preserved and made into a parchment. But still most people wouldn't be ok with that. Because even if this is illogical, in a way people still want to have their bodies treated as if they were alive even after death, not as objects to be taken apart. People have a very strong sense of belonging to their bodies, I mean, even for religious people, their bodies are their vessels, and for non-religious people that's all they have. It's hard to imagine the idea of your body being used for other needs that yours and becoming part of somebody other than you. For many people, getting their organs removed means stripping them of the \"wholeness\" that they had while alive, removing their individuality and turning them into a usable material. People's bodies and what's inside them are very personal to them, so the idea that one day they'll belong to another person whom they don't even know is very unsettling. I think this is the main reason some people don't like the idea of donating their organs, not because they're selfish and evil and want to spite other people.
