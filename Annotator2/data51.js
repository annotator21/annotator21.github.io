Does number of people reading a book count toward the rigor of the book's argument?  No.  Contextually, however, when someone offhandedly rejects the works of people like Kant, Wittgenstein, Hegel, or really any notable giant of any academic discipline (and doubly so for for paradigm shifters like Kant) they should have a better criticism than \"it sounds dumb\" or they shouldn't post.  \n\n&gt;Just because someone is influential, does not mean they are correct.

Unless you are literally one of the foremost intellectuals of the world, as far as intelligence can be reasonably qualified between people, there are people smarter than you, me, everyone in this thread, almost assuredly everyone in this subreddit, and all but a considerably small percentage that have taught Kant over the last 2 centuries in the most elite educational institutions in the world.  I'm not talking about undergrads struggling through his stuff, I'm talking about Saul \"turn down a Harvard Professorship because I'm busy with high school\" Kripke, Frege, Habermas, etc.  By being comfortable dismissing Kant cause it sounds silly to your intuition, you have to be comfortable with the absurd notion that every noted intellectual that had studied and debated him *even if they disagree with him* have **taken him seriously**, and they ***all*** were just coincidentally having moments of accidental stupidity to not feel comfortable dismissing him in one sentence that contains the word \"dumb\".   And c'mon.  Don't name fallacies like we're having a formal debate, the alternative in this situation would be laying out Kant's argument in totality, which you've already established you're not going to do.  \n\n&gt; we are saying that his ideas, if implemented, would cause massive harm to our society.\n\nThat's what you're saying here, but that wasn't what spurred me to make my post, it was calling the Critique dumb that made me respond.  Any argument about consequences of Kantian ethics are legitimate and fine.  Treating Kantian ethics like they were the scribblings of a german psychotic that somehow tricked the global discipline of philosophy into thinking he was anything but \"dumb\" is what I have a problem with.  \n\n&gt;You don't have to be a genius to know that if someone is trying to kill your friends, it is pretty stupid to tell him where they are hiding, yet that is what Kant would have us do.\n\nDo you honestly think that is a substantive dismissal befitting a figure such as himself?

When people say \"Morality is 100% objective\" or \"100% subjective,\" I disagree. Morality is *both*. Life isn't black and white.\n\nFor example, rape, in my view, is objectively immoral. If we define morality as wellbeing, then we can analyze wellbeing in a scientific way by looking at the physical and mental effects following an action. Like with the rape scenario, rape by definition is *nonconsensual*. Rape has harmful effects on the victim's body and psychological health. People who fantasize about rape or pretend to be raped *aren't* being raped because they are consenting. With all that being said, it seems fair to say that rape is objectively immoral. However, we can't write off the fact that some people--though it's hard to imagine--actually might be completely fine after being raped. Life isn't black and white.\n\nAnother example is killing. Killing, in my objective view, is immoral because it might not necessarily diminish wellbeing, but rather *removes any possibility of it*. If this is the only life we have, which is what the evidence would suggest, killing someone is one of the worst things you could possibly do. However, we can't write off that sometimes killing is necessary--for example, killing animals for food or killing a homicidal gunman. Life isn't black and white.\n\nTo bring this all back to the topic at hand, thought experiments *still* don't sway me because they oversimplify reality.

That suffering must all be accounted for when trying to determine the utility of a course of action. We would somehow need to show that the suffering alleviated in the fraction of people affected by ebola outweighed the general suffering that would be caused by instituting such a nightmarish system on a population.\n\nI've generally found that utility as a guide stands up pretty well as long as two things are kept in mind:\n\nFirst, we are always dealing with real people - animals. Real people have limitations that don't allow them to live purely by cold-calculated number-crunching. No matter how rational you are, it would be extremely difficult to kill your own mother even if you absolutely knew it would save thousands of children in China from a torturous death. In the same way, it would be extremely hard for people to accept a life where their young daughter's number could come up and she'd have to be sacrificed to cure a disease currently killing thousands of people, all of her plans and hopes ended consciously by the government at any time. It would be hard because of our nature, but it would also be hard because we know we can't generally trust other humans to have enough accurate information to make such enormously complicated decisions.\n\nSecond, there is no such thing as perfect information. Many examples like the \"trolley problem\" and plenty of other philosophical \"paradoxes\" are made significant by largely ignoring this complication of the best laid plans. Even if we were to accept that we need to weigh the pros and cons of sacrificing a portion of the population to save a larger portion, it would still be an essentially insurmountable task to actually try to quantify the two forms of suffering en masse. On the other hand, we are absolutely positive that living under totalitarian *\"what's best for you is what's best for us\"* regimes causes intense mental anguish in basically all people. So we must err on the side of personal liberty when making these calculations unless we are blessed with better information somehow in the future.\n\nI really like this quote:\n\n*\"The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.\"* - Hayek"}, {"id": "cmk7syi", "body": "Do you have a counter to the Ebola example?

Using \"the ends justify the means\" as a guide for whether or not to kill this innocent man *demands* from you that you 1) know every direct moral consequence of the act with 100% certainty 2) know that the net morality of the people saved will be a greater positive than the net morality of the man you're sacrificing.   \n\nI say that only an omniscient being could act based on \"the ends justify the means\" because any less information and you're not acting with certainty that your actions are moral, but *hope* and *belief*.  **In short, the ends can't justify the means unless you can know all of the ends. Which you can't.**\n\nAs for the fate of the 5: your choice in this scenario is really commit an absolute crime and hopefully it will turn out good, or do an absolute moral good (not killing) and dread that it will turn out poorly for them. You are not the proximate cause of them being on that track, and if they die, it is not because of any immoral act that you committed.

"}, {"id": "cmkcj83", "body": "imo, the trolley problem shows the difference between an active action and an omission of action. Typically, I think people view the omission of action as less of a sin than an active action. Yes, according to the moral calculus, pulling the lever is the right thing to do, but I believe most people have a gut reaction to actively killing a person.\n\nA similar, but opposite question, would be: would you kill a bunch of starving orphans in Africa for $20? The answer would of course be \"no\", because it's morally repugnant. But are you personally as morally culpable because you personally don't donate $20 a month to feed hungry kids in Africa? Every month you don't donate as much money as you could actually afford to send, and they die. Somehow the omission of action is less bad than the act of purposely starving kids for money.\n\nEvery day, you don't volunteer at a homeless shelter, or buy food and give it to people in need, or spend time at an old folks home. Is that somehow, subjectively, in your gut, less \"bad\" than it would be to actively take away food from a hungry, homeless person for $2?\n\nThat's what I think the trolley problem is meant to illustrate. Some people may pull the lever, some people may not. I would *bet* that if only one person was on both tracks, so pulling the lever saved one person but killed another, that almost nobody would pull the lever despite the moral calculus telling you that the action is a net change of 0. And I bet that if a thousand people were on the track and only 1 on the other, that almost everybody would choose to pull the lever.

"}, {"id": "cmkczad", "body": "So there are two basic ways to define defensible, and that is either \"able to be seen as good or acceptable\" or \"able to be protected.\" It is my assumption that you mean the former, that you think the only way to view the action of the hypothetical actor is good or acceptable is if they choose to pull the lever. \n\nThis view, in my opinion, is predicated on the the following assumptions:\n\n* All human life is valuable.\n* All human lives are equally valuable.\n* Actors have a responsibility to preserve human life when possible.\n* Preserving more life is better.\n\nIn order to change you view, I would call into question the third and fourth items, as the hypothetical victims in the scenario are fairly featureless and therefore engaging in suppositions about the one's vs the five's character, quality, utility, etc is not productive. It is clear that there is a scenario which exists in which you could defend inaction if the one is clearly superior to the combined five, but it seems to be disingenuous to discuss and it is clear from your earlier comments that you are unwilling to accept these ideas as evidence contrary to your position.\n\nSo the first question I would ask is, \"Are all human lives inherently worth preserving?\" Certainly most people believe that their own life should be preserved if possible. Further we tend to think that most other people have the same desire to live and it is, therefore, better when people are saved from harm. However, do we always believe that? Obviously there are cases in which we willingly and deliberately take lives as a society, such as in war or as punishment, so even if we think that most of the time most people should be saved, do we really believe that life should always be protected? No, we don't. Beyond that, we often, as a collective society, do little to help those in real suffering because we don't feel connection to victims, such as the West's general sluggishness in responding to the Ebola crisis in Africa, continued civil conflicts in many nations, factory workers who are worked to death or die in industrial accidents around the world, and so on. So if any individual from the world who doesn't work to preserve life whenever possible in these cases could at all be defensible, why should their response of inaction to this scenario be considered any less acceptable or less good than choosing to kill the other person?\n\nHow is preserving more life better? More importantly, if losing any life is bad, what makes the substitution of a smaller loss in for a bigger loss a better choice? This is the point that I think some people struggle with: if there is a no-win situation in front of me, will cutting the losses that I see make me feel good enough to overcome the guilt of being an active agent in the demise of another person.

And I would argue that this knowledge is, morally, practically, and even by the laws of physics, impossible for anyone to have. \n\nI thus prefer an at least partially deontological moral philosophy that gives you a duty to treat all humans as ends themselves, and never as means to an end. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of philosophical problems with pure Kantianism by itself, but that element of it is pretty much necessary to avoid atrocities being justified by morality. \n\nAnd by any kind of consequentialist or utilitarian calculation, atrocities weigh extremely heavily because of their massive negative results.\n\nUltimately, I think Utilitarian consequentialism contains the seeds of its own destruction because of this inevitable logical flaw.

If you choose to pull the lever you are (more or less) stating that it is better that those 5 lives not end than that 1 end.\n\nBut that requires some method of calculating the value of a life. I would suggest that there is no objective way of valuing one life over another, and thus your answer will be subjective (which comes down to the notion that this is a moral question and answers to moral questions will be subjective).\n\nFor example; if the 5 are terminally ill and will be dead by tomorrow, and the 1 is going to live for another 50 years and have many children, one could argue that the life of the 1 is more valuable than the lives of the 5 (looking forward). If the 5 are convicted serial killers and the 1 is innocent one could argue that the life of the 1 is more valuable (looking backwards).\n\nIn order for the choice to pull the lever to be the only defensible one, one has to set up the question so that each of the lives are of equal value (which is also discussed elsewhere).

There are* two *key assumptions; one is that the value of the 5 is greater than the value of the 1 - which is the one implied by the question. The second is that there is a duty on each individual to maximise the total value (taking a path of maximum value, as it were).

The Trolley Problem does not grant me the power to control or even see the events after it's resolution so I cannot say with certainty whether a doctor will or will not go on to save more lives or a murder will or will not go on to kill more people.\n- **Past events have already occurred.** If a person has killed 50 people, killing them will not return those people to life. Also if a person has saved 50 lives, killing them will not kill those people. Retribution is selfish. Justice is a societal construct and should be administered on a societal level, not by individuals that society has not chosen to do so.\n- **People are individually equal.** The external circumstances of a person's life do not grant them any more or less value than any other. A person's ethnicity, economic status, job, lifestyle, health, political leanings, moral framework, or arbitrary position at a given moment do not make them more or less deserving of life than any other person. Because the individuals that comprise the group have just as much right to live as the person on the tracks by themselves, killing either is equal.\n- **All people involved in the Trolley Problem will die.** We cannot control or predict the future with any certainty. The specific moment or cause of death of an individual is irrelevant because we cannot know the effects of their continued life or death.

I think listening won't quite change your view head on, but might help you understand some people's view on it. I'll try my best to ELI5 it, although I might botch it.\n\nIt was along the lines of this: you are standing on a ledge over looking a 5 railway workers on the railroad, and a train is coming that they don't hear. If you pull a lever, the train will divert and go down a separate set of tracks where only one person is, killing just him. If you don't pull the lever, it will kill 5 people.

You're on the same ledge, and the same train is going towards the same 5 people. But now, there is a fat man next to you. If you *push* the man off the ledge, the train will hit him and stop the train. Would you push the man off the ledge, effectively killing him to save 5 more? Another survey they did showed that a lot less people would. I think it was like 50-50 roughly. This is in part because of our brain has evolved to to not kill other human beings, which, in this scenario, \"fights\" with out logical side of things. Logically, killing one to save 5 makes sense. But the other side of our brain is \"yelling\" to NOT kill a human being, and how wrong this is. (And in the podcast they cite studys that show brain scans when giving people these problems, and they can actually show that these different parts of the brain are in a kind of \"war\" to decide which to choose.) \n\nA more extreme version of this, that I guess comes from MASH (old tv show? Idk, im too young to have seen it), is imagine your in a town, hiding in a basement with ~10 people. There are 'bad guys' outside going around killing everyone. With you, you have your baby. Your baby with a cold. And you know that if/when your baby coughs, or sniffles, they bad guys will hear you, find you, kill you, your baby, and everyone with you. So; do you cover your babies mouth to stop him/her from making noises? Which would suffocate the baby, to save the lives of everyone else?

"}, {"id": "cmkw27k", "body": "The problem with this hypothetical thought experiment is not that the information is \"too perfect\" and thus unrealistic. Many people have claimed this, but I argue that a critical detail upon which the decision is hinged has been left out. \n\nWhat do the six pedestrians know about the train? \n\nIn the OP's exact wording, five pedestrians are ON the tracks, and one pedestrian is OFF the tracks. This is key. \n\nThe OP has only considered the numbers of pedestrians that each choice kills. OP fails to consider the inherent meaning of the locations of the pedestrians.\n\nHere is where I get to the missing information: do the pedestrians know where they are? \n\nPerhaps the pedestrians are fully aware of their locations. In this case, the five pedestrians on the tracks should (if they are mentally able adults) be aware that trains do travel on tracks. They should naturally fear that a train may hit them given their position. For as long as those five pedestrians are on the tracks, they should expect that a train may hit them whether they want it to or not.\n\nThe lone pedestrian who is NOT on the tracks, however, has no reason to expect that he is at risk of being hit by a train. In fact, he would be correct in expecting to not be hit by a train given that trains travel on the tracks. \n\nThis difference between the lone pedestrian and the group is important because of their relative degrees of autonomy. We have no idea about whether or not the pedestrians can choose to change locations or not prior to the train's arrival.\n\nIF THEY CAN CHOOSE: If the pedestrians are able to move freely before the arrival of the train, we can conclude that the group of pedestrians has chosen to risk their life by standing on tracks, where trains are a hazard. We can also conclude that the lone pedestrian is unwilling to take that same risk. \nThis scenario is no longer a numbers game. We must quantify the value of a life, and compare it to the quantified value of bodily autonomy. If we pull the lever - killing the lone pedestrian - we indicate that it does not matter that he had not consented to the risk of being hit by the train. If we do not pull the lever - killing the group of pedestrians - then more lives are lost, but those individuals willfully and knowingly accepted the risk of being killed by a train.\n\nAt this point, the \"moral\" decision depends on how the value of life compares to the value of autonomy, to choose not to risk being killed. If autonomy doesn't matter to OP then pulling the lever is still valid. If autonomy is a factor, then how much of one?\n\nIF THE PEDESTRIANS CANNOT CHOSE: If the pedestrians are fixed in place and have no ability to change their positions, then autonomy is not part of the equation since nobody (except the lever puller, apparently) can exercise it in the first place. \n\nI assume that the second scenario isnt the case. Usually in a hypothetical, any abnormal or unexpected condition like this is stated in the question itself. It doesnt make sense to assume (without being told) that the pedestrians can't move. Pragmatically speaking, how did they get where they were in the first place?\n\nAnywho, this may be why your friends would not pull the lever.

"}, {"id": "cml2d0t", "body": "As many have pointed out, you are taking a purely utilitarian position, or in fact a purely *uniform* utilitarian position. It is certainly *one* position to take, but it isn't a self-justification. You can't just assume that the values within utilitarian calculation is automatically the correct answer.\n\nPart of the problem is agency. If you pull the switch, *you* -- as an autonomous agent, have causally killed somebody who had not previously been in any danger. Their death is undeniably *your* fault, a homicide.\n\nThe utilitarian answer essentially says that, yes, this is true, but it is *justifiable* homicide in order to save others, in that sense equating it with killing an assailant to save the lives of their imminent victims, even one victim. The difference there, of course, is one of *deserving*, that an assailant's life is worth less than even one victim because of their own causal relationship, plus the future protection aspect from knowing this is a person who is willing to kill others. Of course we don't know that the person they are killing isn't as bad or worse with respect to harms they'll cause, but we can only go with available information.\n\nNow compare this with doing nothing. Now no agency was involved in killing anyone. Yes, you could have stopped it from happening, but that is fundamentally *different* from *causing* it to happen. There is no homicide, only a tragic accident. Yes, the outcome in terms of number of deaths is worse, but in terms of your *causing* deaths is less -- zero instead of one. The number of deaths you caused is also a metric.\n\nNow which is correct? Well, there isn't a right answer based on any universal value system. Is the causal metric more important than the utilitarian number of deaths metric? On what basis?\n\nYou also need to consider where we get our innate values in this context. We are evolved beings; our innate values (motivations, feelings of guilt, etc., that are non-cognitive) come from our evolution, much of it from social tribes. [Kin selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection) and [reciprocal altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism) were big drivers of our social behaviours toward others that are part of our tribe (in-group). These innocent victims would be considered in-group, but not kin/close people to us. \n\nOur genes selected against us killing people who didn't deserve it (in our minds), as those who did so would tend to be killed by the rest of the tribe. Some form of [tit-for-tat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat) evolved, and we generally follow it, as a means of optimizing reproductive success in such groups. So causally killing somebody who didn't deserve it tends to have a huge negative moral value socially and genetically within our minds, causing anxiety and guilt.\n\nThe genes for *not saving* somebody would not have as much pressure. If you fail to save somebody there are a lot of mitigating factors for your failure: unaware of how to save them, didn't fully comprehend the danger, froze in fear. Or you could just claim them. While some *might* judge you harshly, think of you as cold-hearted or a coward, there'd be no real value in killing you just because you failed to do the optimal thing for your tribe. You aren't an actual danger to them. \n\nSo there should be much less genetic pressure via reproductive success for us to innately feel personal guilt for the deaths that we did not directly cause.\n\nIf this is true, then the metric of \"causing death\" may be much higher than the utilitarian metric in our own innate moral systems, purely based on natural selection which maximizes reproductive success.\n\nIf it is true and most people have this innate response, or you as an individual *think* they do, then there is also the social norm problem. If you think that others will judge you as a murderer by throwing the switch, and less harshly by doing nothing, you'll have incentive not to throw the switch based on the *social moral values* you perceive and have internalized. The law falls in this category as well, as it is an indicator of social values. If you are worried that you might go to jail for throwing the switch, but not for doing nothing, then you might tend to do nothing.\n\nI do not claim to know the *right* answer, as I don't really see that there is one. Rather, your title says you think the utilitarian one is the only *defensible* one. I think I've provided here sufficient reason that the alternative is *defensible*.\n\n**TL;DR: The number of people you causally kill is another metric that competes with the utilitarian number of deaths, and one can't easily be demonstrated superior to the other, particularly once you take into account our evolution of innate values and social norming.**\n"}, {"id": "2o6jhq", "body": "The classic trolley problem: A runaway trolley is barreling down a track and is going to hit five people.

But let's assume that it's in a metropolitan area of 4.5 million people with a strong tourist economy, and boarding for the trolley in an average year is 8.5 million times. It's been in operation for 140 years or so. \n\n\n\nBut as time goes on, the mechanical condition of the system becomes increasingly tenuous. Many years of neglect start to accumulate. The cars and power house start to seem unreliable. The system is bordering on collapse. For the system to continue to operate without an inevitable catastrophic failure, it would be necessary to renew the fixed plant, track, pulleys, winding machinery, power house, and the cars themselves, which instead of housing only 5, house 68 people per car.\n\n\n\nAnd you happen to see this occurring. You know this has been a problem since the 1960s. You happen to be a trolley expert, well versed in its history and operation, as well as the safety protocols necessary for safe operation. Over the last 70 years, you know that the safety protocols are not only archaic, but also not being followed. They aren't up to date to deal with modern urban planning, modern forms of transit, or modern population density. Trolley transit in this town is the most dangerous form of mass transit, causing on average one accident per month. Some are fatalities, some are car collisions, some are just chance events like a bolt sticking up in the track causing the trolley to stop suddenly causing 68 minor, but substantial personal injuries. The total cost to the city is millions annually and the human cost in the city are multiple fatalities per year, injuries ranging from moderate to severe, and a general arbitrary fear that when the trolley bell tolls, it tolls for thee. \n\n\nAs a trolley expert you know all of this. You also know that the government and transit authorities are aware of all of this. Yet the trolley system continues to degrade and injure arbitrarily. The authorities don't want to shut down the trolley, as it generates revenue and brings tourism to the city, both of which the Chamber of Commerce oppose with their campaign dollars and influence. There's also an entire industry surrounding the trolley system and its history, from merchandising to museums, all of which jockey for the continuation of the trolley system. The government can't decommission the system or replace it because of a lack of political will and a general distaste for investing in infrastructure.\n\n\nSo in the end, you have a rather dangerous, aging system of transit that continues to cause fatalities, injuries, and property damage and is kept alive due to two factors: the influence of money and that the impacts are kept to manageable levels. If the money involved disappeared (i.e. tourism for the trolley), the trolley would be decommissioned rapidly and replaced with something more efficient and modern. If the impacts became unmanageable (let's say an entire trolley full of casualties or a trolley ploughs into a crowd), the government and transit authorities would be held accountable for their criminal negligence, as well as publicizing the danger of the trolley, leading to the collapse of trolley based tourism.\n\n\nSo with all of this context, you are presented with the trolley problem.

You know as a trolley expert that this track is turned off because of the parade. But lo and behold, you hear the all-too familiar whisking of a trolley coming down the track. You turn and look and see the trolley, the front of which is covered in the viscera of some poor sap who apparently wasn't protected by numbers.\n\nYou take into account your surroundings and notice an unrealistically fat man, who somehow has the weight density and physical positioning that not only could you shove him successfully off the bridge, but his mass is such that it would stop a 16,000 pound trolley car careening towards the parade.\n\n\nYou now have a decision to make:\n\n\nA) Push the fat man, allowing the trolley system to continue existing by making the levels of death and destruction manageable and thereby not preventing a similar situation arising in the future\n\nB) Let the innocent fat man live, allowing the trolley to smash into the parade, making the possible deaths and destruction unmanageable.
