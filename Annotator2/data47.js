The department store model is dying, so Sears needs to focus on a core demographic and core products. Their stores are too junky to recapture the female fashion market, so they might as well give up on shoes, clothes, perfume, etc.  Likewise, they won't be able to compete in furniture, bedding or housewares without overhauling their ugly, outdated stores.  Even Wal-Mart looks classier than Sears.  They might as well give up on most electronics because there's too much online competition.\n\nBut Sears does still have a fairly decent brand image when it comes to stuff like tools and major appliances (or, rather, their major competitors don't really have a *better* image when it comes to these products).  Many stores still have decent auto repair shops and paint departments.  So, I could see Sears succeeding by shedding the department store dead weight and becoming something more Home Depot-ish.  Maybe they could expand their outdoor and sporting goods selection and offer a range of men's clothing, becoming a one-stop Dad Shop.  They could offer classes and genuine expert advice.  They could have a \"man cave\" department with attractive, IKEA-style mini room displays offering a limited selection of stuff like TVs, recliners, lighting, etc.  IKEA knows how to sell lots of items together by presenting them in a nice, easy package.  Less renovation would be needed if their main competition came from warehouse-type stores like Home Depot.  \n\nExisting Sears stores are mostly large, two-floor buildings, and the rebranded \"Dad Sears\" might not take up all of that space.

I have every intention of following up on this post and replies made to it).\n\nAt the outset I would like to say the following:\n\n* The religious arguments against abortion hold no weight for me whatsoever. I have as little time for them as I have for religious arguments against homosexuality, for example.\n* The view I state in the title is one that I am far from secure in and I expect that there will be a good counter-argument out there, and I would like to hear it.\n* I arrived at this view, independent of anyone else, as a result of following what I believe to be the logical consequences of principles that I apply in other areas. These principles are humanist, and in other areas lead logically to conclusions such as: 'You have no right to tell others what sex they may or may not have, and with whom they may or may not have it, with the sole exception that this sex be conducted healthily between consenting adults'. \n* Such a conclusion as the one above is a principle that I am eminently comfortable with. It troubles me therefore that the same basic tenets can lead me to a view that is so contrary to normal secular humanist thinking, and contrary also to my instinctive moral reaction, on abortion. Presently, however, I can't escape the logic of it. I expect there may be a flaw in my reasoning somewhere but I've not found it myself.\n\nI struggle to get views across in prose without waffling, so I've bullet-pointed the steps my thinking takes to arrive at this point:\n\n* You have the right to do whatever you wish as long as you do not harm anyone else.\n* This logically follows from the concept of personal agency.\n* You have agency over your own body.\n* This is true for every person (human) in the world.\n* There exists no clear biological or philosophical \u2018dividing line' after which an embryo \u2018becomes human\u2019 during the course of pregnancy.\n* Therefore the only possible non-arbitrary \u2018line\u2019 that can be drawn between \u2018human' and 'not-human', is the point of fertilisation.\n* Therefore a pregnant woman is for the entirety of her pregnancy carrying a separate entity that is a human being at every stage of the process.\n* Therefore an abortion violates the right of the embryo to basic personal integrity and agency - the mother is \u2018harming another\u2019\n* The question of abortion does not therefore resemble the question of, for example, consenting sex between adults in terms of personal agency.\n\nCrucial in this is the question of at what point the embryo becomes a human being. Philosophically, one cannot be arbitrary about this, otherwise it is possible for an embryo at (for instance) 24 weeks to be considered 'human' and an embryo at 23 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours to not be considered 'human' - a clear absurdity. In my contention the only clear line, as I have said, that is not hugely arbitrary is the point of conception - the point of the completion of the genetic constitution of a human cell.\n\nThe standard 'pro-choice' argument is that 'a woman has the right to choose what she does with her own body' - and that is absolutely correct, and it would be anathema to me to ever argue anything else. However, does a woman have the right to choose what she does with someone else's body? Logically, that is what I believe the embryo must be considered as.\n\nThe argument I set out above does also possibly allow for exceptions:\n\n* In the case that the embryo is demonstrably not viable (i.e. philosophically already dead);\n* In the case that the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother (producing a moral conflict between the agency and integrity of the mother and that of the child);\n* In the case that a pregnancy results from rape (as this means the pregnancy itself is a violation of the mother's own personal agency);\n\nHowever, it does not provide for an exception where the mother's quality of life or her physical or psychological health would be damaged by carrying the pregnancy through to birth. Nor does it provide for an exception in cases where the child would be born with severely reduced quality of life, such as with severe genetic disorders. Instinctively, I find this difficult to wrap my head around, ethically. This sort of thing is part of why I struggle so much to reconcile my thoughts to themselves on this particular issue - and thus, why I've posted this here.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Her bodily autonomy trumps the fetuses life rights for the same reason as in my example.\n\n&gt;If a patient wakes up and realizes his transplanted kidney was stolen from you, you're not allowed to kill him and take it back.\n\nActually I didn't say that at all. I said if you give them your kidney, you can't take it back. I never said they could steal it. Of course I think there should consequences for stealing, however I only think actively killing them is ok if you have no other choice. \n\nAnyway You aren't gonna change your view with this so I'm out of the conversation, bye."}, {"id": "cmlnyqu", "body": "Your analogy is bad and you should feel bad.\n\nFirst off, nowhere in current law does it say that bodily autonomy can EVER trump right to life. You are allowed to kill only when your life is in danger.

If this is an elective abortion, your doctor has definitely told you that you can survive the pregnancy.\n\nAnother problem with analogies is that they cut both ways and that you admitted that in my case, you would not allow abortions. If this abortion is elective, then there is \"another choice\" to killing the fetus, therefore it's not OK to do so. Of course, my example disregards the mental state of the fetus, the fact that the mother and child are both simultaneously using the organs, and a whole bunch of other factors that you *can't approximate for in analogies.* Argument by analogy is more or less invalid here. \n\nCan we try this argument again without using analogies?"}, {"id": "cmlhnzq", "body": "So what makes the mother's rights supersede the infant's at this point?

I have every intention of following up on this post and replies made to it).\n\nAt the outset I would like to say the following:\n\n* The religious arguments against abortion hold no weight for me whatsoever. I have as little time for them as I have for religious arguments against homosexuality, for example.\n* The view I state in the title is one that I am far from secure in and I expect that there will be a good counter-argument out there, and I would like to hear it.\n* I arrived at this view, independent of anyone else, as a result of following what I believe to be the logical consequences of principles that I apply in other areas. These principles are humanist, and in other areas lead logically to conclusions such as: 'You have no right to tell others what sex they may or may not have, and with whom they may or may not have it, with the sole exception that this sex be conducted healthily between consenting adults'. \n* Such a conclusion as the one above is a principle that I am eminently comfortable with. It troubles me therefore that the same basic tenets can lead me to a view that is so contrary to normal secular humanist thinking, and contrary also to my instinctive moral reaction, on abortion. Presently, however, I can't escape the logic of it. I expect there may be a flaw in my reasoning somewhere but I've not found it myself.\n\nI struggle to get views across in prose without waffling, so I've bullet-pointed the steps my thinking takes to arrive at this point:\n\n* You have the right to do whatever you wish as long as you do not harm anyone else.\n* This logically follows from the concept of personal agency.\n* You have agency over your own body.\n* This is true for every person (human) in the world.\n* There exists no clear biological or philosophical \u2018dividing line' after which an embryo \u2018becomes human\u2019 during the course of pregnancy.\n* Therefore the only possible non-arbitrary \u2018line\u2019 that can be drawn between \u2018human' and 'not-human', is the point of fertilisation.\n* Therefore a pregnant woman is for the entirety of her pregnancy carrying a separate entity that is a human being at every stage of the process.\n* Therefore an abortion violates the right of the embryo to basic personal integrity and agency - the mother is \u2018harming another\u2019\n* The question of abortion does not therefore resemble the question of, for example, consenting sex between adults in terms of personal agency.\n\nCrucial in this is the question of at what point the embryo becomes a human being. Philosophically, one cannot be arbitrary about this, otherwise it is possible for an embryo at (for instance) 24 weeks to be considered 'human' and an embryo at 23 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours to not be considered 'human' - a clear absurdity. In my contention the only clear line, as I have said, that is not hugely arbitrary is the point of conception - the point of the completion of the genetic constitution of a human cell.\n\nThe standard 'pro-choice' argument is that 'a woman has the right to choose what she does with her own body' - and that is absolutely correct, and it would be anathema to me to ever argue anything else. However, does a woman have the right to choose what she does with someone else's body? Logically, that is what I believe the embryo must be considered as.\n\nThe argument I set out above does also possibly allow for exceptions:\n\n* In the case that the embryo is demonstrably not viable (i.e. philosophically already dead);\n* In the case that the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother (producing a moral conflict between the agency and integrity of the mother and that of the child);\n* In the case that a pregnancy results from rape (as this means the pregnancy itself is a violation of the mother's own personal agency);\n\nHowever, it does not provide for an exception where the mother's quality of life or her physical or psychological health would be damaged by carrying the pregnancy through to birth. Nor does it provide for an exception in cases where the child would be born with severely reduced quality of life, such as with severe genetic disorders. Instinctively, I find this difficult to wrap my head around, ethically. This sort of thing is part of why I struggle so much to reconcile my thoughts to themselves on this particular issue - and thus, why I've posted this here.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "2o9wje", "body": "(Using a throwaway as this is a sensitive issue and, perhaps, a controversial opinion. I have every intention of following up on this post and replies made to it).\n\nAt the outset I would like to say the following:\n\n* The religious arguments against abortion hold no weight for me whatsoever. I have as little time for them as I have for religious arguments against homosexuality, for example.\n* The view I state in the title is one that I am far from secure in and I expect that there will be a good counter-argument out there, and I would like to hear it.\n* I arrived at this view, independent of anyone else, as a result of following what I believe to be the logical consequences of principles that I apply in other areas. These principles are humanist, and in other areas lead logically to conclusions such as: 'You have no right to tell others what sex they may or may not have, and with whom they may or may not have it, with the sole exception that this sex be conducted healthily between consenting adults'. \n* Such a conclusion as the one above is a principle that I am eminently comfortable with. It troubles me therefore that the same basic tenets can lead me to a view that is so contrary to normal secular humanist thinking, and contrary also to my instinctive moral reaction, on abortion. Presently, however, I can't escape the logic of it. I expect there may be a flaw in my reasoning somewhere but I've not found it myself.\n\nI struggle to get views across in prose without waffling, so I've bullet-pointed the steps my thinking takes to arrive at this point:\n\n* You have the right to do whatever you wish as long as you do not harm anyone else.\n* This logically follows from the concept of personal agency.\n* You have agency over your own body.\n* This is true for every person (human) in the world.\n* There exists no clear biological or philosophical \u2018dividing line' after which an embryo \u2018becomes human\u2019 during the course of pregnancy.\n* Therefore the only possible non-arbitrary \u2018line\u2019 that can be drawn between \u2018human' and 'not-human', is the point of fertilisation.\n* Therefore a pregnant woman is for the entirety of her pregnancy carrying a separate entity that is a human being at every stage of the process.\n* Therefore an abortion violates the right of the embryo to basic personal integrity and agency - the mother is \u2018harming another\u2019\n* The question of abortion does not therefore resemble the question of, for example, consenting sex between adults in terms of personal agency.\n\nCrucial in this is the question of at what point the embryo becomes a human being. Philosophically, one cannot be arbitrary about this, otherwise it is possible for an embryo at (for instance) 24 weeks to be considered 'human' and an embryo at 23 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours to not be considered 'human' - a clear absurdity. In my contention the only clear line, as I have said, that is not hugely arbitrary is the point of conception - the point of the completion of the genetic constitution of a human cell.\n\nThe standard 'pro-choice' argument is that 'a woman has the right to choose what she does with her own body' - and that is absolutely correct, and it would be anathema to me to ever argue anything else. However, does a woman have the right to choose what she does with someone else's body? Logically, that is what I believe the embryo must be considered as.\n\nThe argument I set out above does also possibly allow for exceptions:\n\n* In the case that the embryo is demonstrably not viable (i.e. philosophically already dead);\n* In the case that the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother (producing a moral conflict between the agency and integrity of the mother and that of the child);\n* In the case that a pregnancy results from rape (as this means the pregnancy itself is a violation of the mother's own personal agency);\n\nHowever, it does not provide for an exception where the mother's quality of life or her physical or psychological health would be damaged by carrying the pregnancy through to birth. Nor does it provide for an exception in cases where the child would be born with severely reduced quality of life, such as with severe genetic disorders. Instinctively, I find this difficult to wrap my head around, ethically. This sort of thing is part of why I struggle so much to reconcile my thoughts to themselves on this particular issue - and thus, why I've posted this here.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This seems arbitrary. Medical advances are steadily changing the age of viability. How is it that a fetus at the same stage of development is considered a human at 28 weeks several years ago, but today you would consider it a human at 21 weeks? A fetus at 26 weeks in this day and age it surely the same as it was several years ago. Perhaps someday it will change again to 20 weeks, or even younger. I can see the logic behind the age of viability as a point to consider it a human, but it seems arbitrary because it isn't based on the development of the fetus itself, but rather on current medical advances. Humanity isn't based on the state of medicine's ability to keep a person alive. It should be based on a certain criteria derived from the organism itself. A heartbeat, a certain amount of brain activity, etc. These milestones are much less arbitrary in my mind. But to me, it is a human at any stage of development because from the very beginning it is a steadily growing, developing human. From conception to the time a person is 80. Every single person began developing into the person they are today at the time of conception. There is no time in the womb that the fetus transforms into a different organism, it is always the same organism which is constantly growing and developing further. So in my mind any point besides conception seems arbitrary because it is the same organism at 24 weeks as it was at 23, and the same 23 as it was 22, so on and so forth all the way back to conception. Conception is *the* point we can point to and say \"this is when I began to exist\"."}, {"id": "cmmemek", "body": "&gt; So the point at which a fetus becomes a human is subject to change?

For the average salaried worker, amount of work =/= hours worked. There are always ways to increase efficiency and improve your working style. I've seen managers with a 10-5 pound out a demanding job, but they allocate 30min every morning and evening to deal with emails and urgent requests at work. It really boils down to your personal time management skills and how focused your remain at your job. Some companies have a toxic office culture that encourages \"presence\" at the job more so than ability, meaning management wants to see you at the desk, regardless if there is any productivity achieved. See 3.\n\n2. False, most workaholics work for the sense of self satisfaction. Don't bullshit around this, there are numerous comparable jobs, but they may not command the same level of respect, status, etc. Ultimately, you will be rewarded based upon ability, not staying 2 hours later than everyone else. In fact, this could have a negative impact on your career mobility as your will always be seen as \"the analyst\" or \"the sales guy\", instead of moving upwards towards a more balanced role.\n\n3. There is an alternative. Find a new job. During job interviews, clarify what you're looking for in a position. Believe it or not, so many companies now encourage telework/flexible work schedules because their employees are more productive with their time, plus its seen as an employee benefit to attract better talent.  And don't leave a current job until you have a new one lined up for god's sake. This should be obvious. \n\nIn the end, time is precious, and time=money in more ways than I ever realized before working FT. Most people already spend more than 50% of their waking hours at work, and once they reach retirement age, their biggest regret is usually working too much.

Diagnosing illness and prescribing treatment can actually be difficult. Especially in the case of mental illness, it may take many doctors opinions to decide whether or not you have a mental illness. Doctors don't want to just give out prescriptions of medication because people may abuse them. As a result, they must go through extensive checks to make sure that you truly require them. Your entire trial scenario is an overtly unnecessary form of what already exists. Another example is assisted suicide. To get the medication for euthanasia you must be diagnosed with a terminal illness by multiple doctors, have informed consent, be a resident of the state, be of legal age, have made an oral request, make another request several days later, your case must be reviewed, etc.\n\nNo matter what, biased or uneducated people may be in the position of authority. There's no flawless human who can serve as a robot that automatically sentences the guilty to prison and lets the innocent go.

A government that exists only when there is no chance of error will not exist at all.\n\nIn conclusion, the Punishment Imperative (The rationale for mass incarceration) is coming to an end because of fiscal pressures, falling crime rates, and evidence of it's failure.

But I don't blame the NYPD for it. Occasionally a cop goes insane and does something like this. The NYPD commissioner seems to be on Garner's side, and many officers have said that what the police officer did was not protocol and was wrong.\n\nBut the police can't know if an officer will do something that goes completely against his training. The truth is the NYPD has been very good in racial issues and keeping crime low. Stop and frisk may seem to be contrary to that, but that was a policy that told the police to go into poor (black) neighborhoods and frisk people. This was not a decision made by the police.\n\nThe problem with the Garner case is the justices system's failure to indite Eric Garner's murderer. Pantaleo murdered Eric Garner. There isn't really any question about this. He did not follow police protocol and attacked a man with his hands in the air and killed him as he begged to breathe.\n\nPantaleo deserves to go to trial, for at least manslaughter if not first degree murder. There is no reasonable doubt or any question of what happened like there was in the Micheal Brown case. With Micheal Brown there was a lack of evidence and conflicting reports, so we can't know and therefore can't prosecute.\n\nBut in the Garner case there was no question. We know what happened.\n\nMy only conclusion from this is that the grand jury had a majority of either incredibly racist people or people who were incredibly loyal to the police for no reason.\n\nI believe that to fix this problem we need to stop using grand juries to decide whether or not to indite. They have proven themselves to be a horrible tool. Instead we should use a panel of judges, or just go to trial immediately when the evidence is this overwhelming. (EDIT: maybe not go to trial immediately. My main call is for a change in the process. I do not necessarily have the change needed.)\n\nThe reason I want my view changed is that I'd like the believe that our system isn't horribly unjust.

The public? We already know what a lot of the public's view is of police officers. Realistically, there's already as much checks and balances as are reasonable for integrity of the jury, judge, and prosecutor. Your suggestion of a \"new committee\" is exactly what a grand jury is. The JURY (of 12, randomly selected people with no previous connection to either side of the case) decides guilt or innocence, by either a 2/3 or 3/4 majority, depending on state. Not the judge, and not the prosecutor.\n\nYour \"solution\" is already how grand juries work. Any and all evidence is up for examination. Any defendant who appears is not allowed an attorney. Are you trying to suggest that the prosecutor didn't show all the evidence? What were they holding back after releasing almost 5,000 pages of documentation? Was Wilson not questioned hard enough on the witness stand? Did you read the testimony?\n\nMost, if not all of, the articles linked by 538 in regards to police indictment, all specify on-duty, officer-involved shootings. In other words, mostly cases where it would be classified as self-defense. And some of them are pretty clear. Most of them I'd not even heard of. I would like to see a measurement of number of civilian self-defense shootings that were a) heard by a grand jury in the first place as murder charges, and b) were or were not indicted. I suspect that that number would be close to the same as it was for police officers. \n\nSo I'll try to change your view to this: Maybe the reason police shootings have such a low indictment rate is because of a commitment to transparency. Theoretically, if every time an officer fires their gun, or ends up killing someone through other means, it comes up to a grand jury, what are the odds that they will find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was murder? Or even that it was not self-defense. If, every time a homeowner shot an intruder, it came up to a grand jury, what percent of those would result in indictments. The idea of a grand jury is that it gives power to people who don't normally work in law enforcement."}, {"id": "cmlssye", "body": "We don't need to fix human psychology, just the system.

Doesn't this just waste more time and resources for those involved if there's a 99% chance the case is going to trial anyway?\n\nThe point of the Grand Jury is to have the populace (or a cross-section thereof) say that there is probable cause that a crime was committed. There are many cases where the prosecutor may believe that a crime was committed, but not have the evidence. That won't be put in front of a grand jury, and won't proceed forward. It's a bit of selection bias, in that those cases that go in front of the grand jury receive indictments - but doesn't count how many cases don't go in front of a grand jury. \n\nSecondly, just because there is an indictment doesn't mean the case is going to trial. There are many things that can happen between the grand jury and trial - including a plea deal (the most common) or a motion in limine (pre-trial motion) that tosses out the prosecution's best evidence. \n\n&gt;One poster mentioned that the idea of an easy indictment is heavily skewed, because prosecutors won't bother bringing a case to a Grand Jury if they don't have the evidence. Is there truth to this?\n\nTo some extent, yes. To another extent, no. Prosecutors are generally trusted by the population, along with law enforcement. (Reddit, of course, being the contrarian group it is, is an exception to the rule.) This means that it is easy to lead a grand jury, for good or ill. But in general, I believe that prosecutors present cases that only have enough evidence to proceed forward. Remember, all those prosecutors have bosses they have to justify their actions to. It's not as though they're independently autonomous. In fact, depending on how the prosecutor's office is set up, as soon as an indictment is secured, the case may go to another prosecutor. If the first prosecutor misrepresented facts, it's going to be known within the prosecutor's office, and there will be consequences. \n\n&gt;Might it also be fair to say that the Grand Jury has become something of a political tool that allows the prosecution to bring a case to a Grand Jury, even though he knows he doesn't have a case, just to placate a group of individuals?\n\nWell, sure. In fact, I (and some of my colleagues) believe that is the case with the Ferguson proceedings. Otherwise, the presenting of exculpatory evidence and copies of laws which provide for defenses to a crime would not have occurred. \n\nOne of the reasons being that prosecutors and police officers are generally allies. If you, as a prosecutor, want to have evidence of a shoplifting crime, you need the assistance of the police. And if you want that police officer to testify about the arrest, you need to be nice. Indicting one (however guilty) isn't going to do you any favors. Politically, it is a serious issue. In some ways, I'd be interested in some method of a prosecutor's internal affairs office - a subsection who indict police officers and are able to avoid (to an extent) the politics. I'm sure there's a reason it hasn't been done, but I haven't done much research into it yet. \n\nGlad I was able to help a little!

The grand jury's common implementation on the city/county level isn't directly relevant to those constitutional purposes or intent. Though they are precautionary in the case of constitutional rights, it's moot to the case at hand which is what I'm directly speaking to, and which no one is actually representing Eric.

I'm still learning a lot myself, but the three party system is what I'm trying to direct the attention to here. Expecting public officials to represent people like Eric without exception is a disregard of Thomas Paine's general precept because this is a clear case of state interests only looking out for state interests. Also, I'm not trying to deter protest in any way shape or form; I'm just trying to help people know the game that's being played, not the score.

But I don't blame the NYPD for it. Occasionally a cop goes insane and does something like this. The NYPD commissioner seems to be on Garner's side, and many officers have said that what the police officer did was not protocol and was wrong.\n\nBut the police can't know if an officer will do something that goes completely against his training. The truth is the NYPD has been very good in racial issues and keeping crime low. Stop and frisk may seem to be contrary to that, but that was a policy that told the police to go into poor (black) neighborhoods and frisk people. This was not a decision made by the police.\n\nThe problem with the Garner case is the justices system's failure to indite Eric Garner's murderer. Pantaleo murdered Eric Garner. There isn't really any question about this. He did not follow police protocol and attacked a man with his hands in the air and killed him as he begged to breathe.\n\nPantaleo deserves to go to trial, for at least manslaughter if not first degree murder. There is no reasonable doubt or any question of what happened like there was in the Micheal Brown case. With Micheal Brown there was a lack of evidence and conflicting reports, so we can't know and therefore can't prosecute.\n\nBut in the Garner case there was no question. We know what happened.\n\nMy only conclusion from this is that the grand jury had a majority of either incredibly racist people or people who were incredibly loyal to the police for no reason.\n\nI believe that to fix this problem we need to stop using grand juries to decide whether or not to indite. They have proven themselves to be a horrible tool. Instead we should use a panel of judges, or just go to trial immediately when the evidence is this overwhelming. (EDIT: maybe not go to trial immediately. My main call is for a change in the process. I do not necessarily have the change needed.)\n\nThe reason I want my view changed is that I'd like the believe that our system isn't horribly unjust.

I can't speak to his training in medicine, though I think it's fair to presume that he does know that a chokehold can kill. I think it's a stretch to say that he knew or should have known that a chokehold, held for ~12 seconds, released while the victim is conscious, is of such a nature to cause or be likely to cause death. \n\nI think an indictment could make sense - I mean, an indictment isn't hard to get if the prosecutor is intent on getting one - but a conviction is prohibitively unlikely for murder with these facts. The thought around this case seems to be that the officer should have treated him as something like an \"eggshell plaintiff.\" I hate to use civil terms in a criminal context, but I'm sure you understand what I mean there. I don't think that's appropriate for this situation, given the stature of the man and his clear physical resistance to the arrest.\n\nAnd to address the elephant in the room - I can see what you're saying about the relative \"closeness\" of intentionally to knowingly, but proving intent in this case is so unlikely that I consider it nigh-impossible. If he had held on 10-15 few more seconds (to the point where the victim was unconscious before he released the hold) or behaved in a way that suggests he was attempting to kill the victim, intent could be provable.

With  intent  to  cause the death of another person, he causes the\ndeath of  such  person  or  of  a  third  person; except [list of exceptions that do not apply].\"\n\nWell, the officer killed the citizen, no?

I mean, I would have to see some extreme evidence to think that the officer did not *knowingly* kill this citizen with a choke hold.  Are we on the same page?  Sure, I wouldn't claim that the officer knowingly killed the citizen **beyond a reasonable doubt.**  But we're not at that standard, yet, right?  This is just talking indictment / probable cause.\n\nThe real question I have for you, then, is how much gray area do you think there is between the officer knowing a choke hold kills and the officer intentionally killed the citizen?
