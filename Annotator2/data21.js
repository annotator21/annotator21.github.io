If you don't do this, you put both your car and the cars next to you at risk for scratches/dings.\n\nThis is wrong.  I back in almost exclusively and I never turn my head around.  Once you learn how to use your mirrors properly, it's totally unnecessary.  I don't back in slowly.  I've never hit a car.  I'm going to explain my procedure.  It may sound complicated, but all this stuff happens within a few seconds in your brain.  It can handle it.  It's super simple.\n\nThe first step is to glance at the two cars you're going to be parking in between as you pull up.  Are they inside their own lines?  If yes, then you can largely forget the cars.  All you care about now are the white lines.  As you get up to the space, swing left in a nice, fluid motion.  \n\nNow, turn the wheel to the right about as far as your turned it to the left, and as you back up you'll see the white lines in your sideview mirrors.  As you reverse and begin turning the wheel back to center, you'll see the angle of the lines shifting in relation to your car.  It's like a video game: Just get your car between the white lines.\n\nSince you're backing in, you're now effectively steering with the \"rear\" wheels.  This is a huge advantage for maneuvering in tight spots like this.  Any small steering adjustment you make at this point is going to have a large change in the angle of the car.  Compare this to steering while driving forward and you see that the rear end of the car is slow to react in that scenario.  This is why forklifts and pallet jacks steer from the rear.\n\nAnyway, the object of the game is to get the two white lines straight and evenly spaced in your mirrors and then just go!  Back straight up and you're done.  Getting them evenly spaced sounds hard, but it's not because you're steering from the rear.  \n\nIn summary, all you're doing is lining up a couple white lines in your mirrors that are now easily adjustable given the steering conditions.  I find it far easier than trying to get the correct angle for pulling in.  When you pull in, you can't swing the rear of your car further out if you miscalculated your initial trajectory.  Your only choice is to back out again (at least a little bit) and swing wider/re-align your car.  It's also a lot harder to make sure you're evenly spaced between the lines since it's impossible to see them once you start pulling in.  You have to watch the front left of the car and the right rear at the same time to make sure you're not hitting your adjacent parking buddies.  That's so much harder than hardly worrying about them at all.\n\nBacking in is far superior.  All it takes is a little practice.  I bet if you did it for an hour, you'd find it simple!

I'm bewildered by your hostility.  I provide a detailed explanation of how to back in to a parking space and you think there's something wrong with me mentally?  And how did we get to patronizing?  Because I said it's simple?  Does that really imply that I think I'm superior?  I was just excited, man.  I only said the stuff about practice to be encouraging.  A lot of people see a detailed explanation like the one I typed out and think \"Man, this is complicated\" so I just wanted to clarify that although the explanation was lengthy, the action itself is really simple once you practice it for a bit.  That's all.\n\n&gt;My view was not that its hard to back up my car. \n\nThe first sentence from your original post stated: \"Its always a little bit harder to back into a spot.\"  You then went on to state reasons for this view.  I noticed that your characterization of backing up was one that was not true across the board, and certainly not for myself and others that can speedily back into spaces.  I was addressing that. \n\nYou also said, \"You are wasting far more time backing into the space in the first place, than you are saving,\" and \" It takes significantly longer than just pulling into the spot, front first.\" I found those statements to be empirically false, so I provided evidence to illustrate how it *doesn't* take significantly longer to back in.  I don't see how directly criticizing your premise isn't exactly what I'm supposed to be doing here.\n\n&gt;My view is that backing up your car into a space is not inherently safer. That view still stands.\n\nI already explained that when you're backing up, the lines are clearly visible, you can more easily make corrections to the orientation of your car due to the rear-wheel steering factor, and you don't have to worry about checking your right rear/left front (assuming a right turn-in) for scraping on your neighbors.  How is that not safer?  \n\n&gt;most people do suck at backing up. \n\nRight.  Which is why I suggested a little practice and you're good to go.  I don't get what's wrong with that.  That is how one typically learns how to do something, is it not?  It's not like I came out of the womb driving cars.  I practiced it and now I'm sharing what I've learned.  That seems like a cool thing to do.

Usually with lies of this nature, the details are (1) meant to factually mislead to evade responsibility/participation, but convey enough information so you can understand his feelings and that the event happened, (2) the details are therefore highly allegorical.\n\nYou can tell which are lies, which are \"felt\", and which are real by which ones change.\n\nIn other words his being &lt;WINK&gt; \"drugged\" can mean something like \"seduced\". And why not? This huge and relevant factor to the story that changed. Yet in every story he's still in the bed. That's because the drugging wasn't important or the point of the story. What was important was the feeling of having been violated or \"under the influence\" or not himself or in control.\n\nWhen people lie like this, they don't feel as bad because their lie represents an internal reality or feeling. They're not concerned with facts, but the intensity of their emotions. This can be for many reasons from a legitimate personal crisis (a straight man traumatized by a homosexual act, or a step too early out of the closet, etc.), a lie (maybe he was the cuddler, likes you or him, confessed to him and is afraid of being outed so is discrediting, etc.), a drama prone personality disorder emerging, etc. You really can't tell it doesn't seem, so you probably shouldn't be making any judgments, but collecting information, as you seem to be led along a *little* too easily to be discerning your friend's true motives without even understanding his lie.\n\nThe best thing you can probably do is be upfront or back off of it entirely."}, {"id": "2p3d0h", "body": "So a very close friend of mine talked to me. he was extremely depressed (and still is).

He said he felt betrayed, violated, slutty. Everything you'd expect to hear from a rape victim. I immediately advised him to get away from that friend (the rapist).

He didn't really get drugged, he doesn't even think so anymore. It was just a wild guess. He probably just got sleepy (according to my friend, the victim) and when he woke up, his friend was simply half naked and cuddled with him. That's it. I'm trying to support my friend who's majorly depressed about it. But honestly, I can't take him seriously anymore. I mean, I understand this might count as sexual harassment. But it's not that huge. Seriously, he keeps talking to me about it, and how they were really close and how he miss those days but he can't ever forgive him.

Which is to say that if I had a diamond, I would sell it because it is expensive.\n\nWe *will* continue to have lots of sex, because the fact that the price of sexual partners is low does not mean that sex is commodified and our relationship made worthless. There is only one me, and one him. I can't have sex **with him** unless I'm doing it with him, and I love him deeply and want to express that with sexual intimacy.\n\nIt sounds like what you're worried about is that I can't be as close to him because he's not the only one I can have sex with, not the only one I can kiss and cuddle with and feel emotionally connected with. The trouble with this is that it sounds like it's coming from an alien that doesn't know about the existence of love. People fall in love with individuals, not generic commodified human beings. My relationship isn't special because it gives us access to sex -- we could get that anywhere -- it's special because we care about each other as individuals.\n\nThe fact that access to sexual and emotional intimacy *isn't* contingent on the continuation of our relationship actually strengthens our relationship enormously by engendering a tremendous amount of trust and freedom. If I have a biological need for sex with \"someone\", as opposed to an emotional desire to express sexual intimacy with him specifically, it does not create stress on our relationship if he is unable or unwilling to provide that. Instead, we have sex with each other *because we want to express our love for each other*. We don't just do it because we're horny.\n\nBecause sex is \"cheap\" -- which is to say, *inexpensive*, not devalued -- our relationship is guaranteed to never be based on necessity or convenience or access to sex; it is guaranteed to be based on the fact that we want to spend our lives together and care deeply about each other as individuals. If that ever changes, we'll break up and move on with our lives. We'll never be an unhappy couple, unable to work things out, and afraid to split up because we aren't sure if there's anyone else out there. And that is an extremely beautiful aspect to our relationship."}, {"id": "cmtimms", "body": "&gt;We won't be getting diamonds because scarcity does not create value, it creates price.\n\nPrice, via the market, is a pretty good indicator of perceived value. Hence de Beers. I agree with you regarding the rings, but we have to acknowledge that we're a small minority.\n\nI like iridium.\n\n&gt;It sounds like what you're worried about is that I can't be as close to him because he's not the only one I can have sex with, not the only one I can kiss and cuddle with and feel emotionally connected with.\n\nNo, I'm worried about sex *itself* between two loving people being devalued by virtue of it being less and less special through being less scarce. To put it another way, you'd value sex with your partner a lot more if he/she would have been the only person you've ever had sex with, and less if he/she's the 645th in line. The same way your first car, your first love, your first house, etc. are all special. Ideally, your first partner would be your last, and you'd live happily ever after, etc.\n\n&gt;If I have a biological need for sex with \"someone\", as opposed to an emotional desire to express sexual intimacy with him specifically, it does not create stress on our relationship if he is unable or unwilling to provide that.\n\nSee, this is the thing that I *am* legitimately abnormal regarding: I don't *really* have a strong desire to simply have sex with \"someone\". I masturbate to satiate that need. Sex, to me, is an expression of affection, not a simple need. Now, I am on one extreme end of the spectrum, but I see you as a representation of a slide toward the other extreme: someone who, despite being \"in love\" with *one* person, doesn't consider sex inherently a link exclusively to their partner. I don't think I have to explain how this is very conducive to cheating; some people won't bother to go through the conversation and honesty and risk in trying to establish an open relationship."}, {"id": "cmtbakx", "body": "&gt;You are trying to imply that those 2 definitions are the same thing\n\nI am referring to neither.

Last time I checked, increased competition is alway a good thing.  Its not like having more of a choice makes me value something I love any less.  I would say that each item, or person in this case, is different.  There is no one out there like my girlfriend, she is unique.  I was able to weed out the people I know I would have compatibility issues with because I met her online.  Because of this, I was able to find a quality partner, which leads to higher quality sex.  Not all sex is equal, just like not all partners are equal. I don't see the point of bringing sex into this.  Its not like my primary goal in finding a partner was sex.  That was the last thing I thought about when trying to find a partner.\n\nOr do you believe that supply goes up but the demand stays the same?  I don't know how.  There is an equal increase in people seeking a partner and those offering to be a partner. That would be the only way its value would change, that is if you see the primary goal of online dating is sex. I try to avoid those people who just want sex."}, {"id": "cmtbakx", "body": "&gt;You are trying to imply that those 2 definitions are the same thing\n\nI am referring to neither.

All that online dating has done is increase the speed with which people can do that - as well as everything else they do because putting something online almost invariably speeds things up.\n\nIs it a bad thing if by sorting through dozens of times more people, the folks seeking mates can find someone closer to what they think they want than they could previously?

We are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all. We up-sell one another all the time. Relationships are harder to maintain because THE second things become difficult, we can simply browse online for another potential match and go from there.\n\nOnline dating creates unrealistic expectations... Men/women are checked against a laundry list of required attributes and are disqualified if they don't meet everyone. \n\nIt cheapens sex. We view each others as items that can be disregarded at a moments notice. Finally, online dating has profoundly negative effects on people who are not desirable.I for one can say that online dating has altered to way I view my own race. It is not a very pleasant realization to come to after facing rejection.\n\n**TLDR: Online dating is making us increasingly shallow and cheapening sex.

We are so socialized to accept that having kids is just part of life that I find few people question why they *should*.  To me, the question is no different than stating I don't want a pet (which nobody questions).\n\nTo answer your question, I am very career driven, invest a lot of time in myself (I'm a self improvement junkie - 10-15 hours/week at the gym, clean nutrition, always reading and learning, etc) and I like to put a lot of energy into my relationship with my partner (though I am currently dating/single-ish, I've always been a monogamous, long term relationship kind of guy).  I simply don't want to divert that energy.\n\nFurther, the average kid costs $230k, before post-secondary education.  As someone who is tracking to retire by 45, and is shooting for 39, that is quite the chunk of cash and would delay my own goals for much longer.\n\nAnd lastly, I like kids, but very much on a part time basis.  I don't feel I could have the patience or the time required to be anything more than \"Uncle rand486\".\n\nThis turned into a much longer response than I intended, and I'm on my phone so I won't bother editing, but I would love to hear why you feel I *should* have kids.  I have yet to be given a compelling answer - most simply blurt out the indoctrinated \"unconditional love\" or \"who will take care of you when youre old?\"; the former being a false concept, and the latter always striking me as a very selfish reason to have kids.\n\n**tl dr** lifestyle, finances, and why should I anyway?  ;)"}, {"id": "2p35fn", "body": "This \"problem\" is something I have noted for a while now, and I don't believe it is written about, or discussed enough as a real challenge facing people today.\n\nWe shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through Amazon.com and I think that is a problem. We are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all. We up-sell one another all the time. Relationships are harder to maintain because THE second things become difficult, we can simply browse online for another potential match and go from there.\n\nOnline dating creates unrealistic expectations... Men/women are checked against a laundry list of required attributes and are disqualified if they don't meet everyone. \n\nIt cheapens sex. We view each others as items that can be disregarded at a moments notice. Finally, online dating has profoundly negative effects on people who are not desirable.I for one can say that online dating has altered to way I view my own race. It is not a very pleasant realization to come to after facing rejection.\n\n**TLDR: Online dating is making us increasingly shallow and cheapening sex.

That said if you're a woman looking for casual sex, well, why even go online when you could just smile and be friendly/flirty to men you see around town.  Thus for a woman it's quite easy to find casual sex because so many messages are coming and of those most are likely looking for casual sex.  The internet gives men the opportunity to be honest and up front about their desire for casual sex.

While I've had plenty of casual sex in my day, I never went looking for it.  Believe it or not, no matter how unlikely the match would turn into a relationship the desire for the potential relationship, or friendship that could lead to meeting more men and a potential relationship, was there.  I might start a date not knowing if a man was relationship material, just someone fun to hang with or someone whom I would have a one night stand with.  Given the situation, I was open to all three outcomes.  \n\nSo when initiating contact online, please say something interesting.  Please show you've read the profile of the lady and you found something in it that sparked up a conversation.  Just because you're looking for casual sex does not mean you can address a stranger online with \"hey baby, let's fuck\", sending a dick pic and requesting a return, or something similar.  Okay, so you've looked at her picture.  You're so horny, and instantly you want to fuck this woman.  I get it... maybe she'd be into that.  Next step:  Read her profile.  If there is anything in it that doesn't fit, jack off and move on.  Next step: You've found a beautiful woman, you've read her profile and think she's actually pretty amazing too...now what to say to her?  Find something in her profile that really got you going.  Like, OMG, she plays video games too, better yet she plays your favorite video games.  You could fire off a quick email saying, \"OMG, I like to playing said video game too!\"  You've done a half ass job.  Lots of dudes love said video game, but you're on your way.  Say something interesting.  For example, \"I see you're into said video game, what did you think of such and such aspect of the game?  I thought it was...  I also like this other game, it's similar yet different in these awesome ways....\"  Then continue on telling her what you're looking for.  It's much better to have your options open and be looking for the possibility of more than casual sex.  If so state this, maybe not in the first message.  Short can be sweet.  But if casual sex is your main bag and your unavailable for anything deeper even with an amazing woman, then you should absolutely tell her before you meet up.  You're going to have a lot better of a chance to get to the point of telling her (in a way she'll care to respond too) if you engage her personally and make her want to CHOOSE you above all the other invites to trade naked photos or comply with the request to just fuck. \nShe will likely also read your profile.

You're making assumptions."}, {"id": "cmt4g0c", "body": "TLDR: Opposing experience for heterosexual men and women, plus tips to find the women online looking for casual sex and how to actually get to the point of meeting up.  \n\nThis totally depends on your gender, given that you are heterosexual (I have no information on what it is like for those with different sexual orientations.)  The experience of straight men and straight women is practically opposite and neither has an incentive to change their behavior.  It's a Nash Equilibrium.  Women are flooded with messages making it more work to initiate connections.  As such men could choose not to initiate contact, but wouldn't get many messages because women are inundated so much.  Thus their main choice is to send many messages to many women with little attachment to each.  Similar to cold calls in marketing, to be successful men would have to send many messages hoping to get a hit and not emotionally attach themselves to any one woman prior to receiving a response.  This non attachment perhaps gives the advantage to men who are looking for casual sex versus men who are looking for relationships.  That said if you're a woman looking for casual sex, well, why even go online when you could just smile and be friendly/flirty to men you see around town.  Thus for a woman it's quite easy to find casual sex because so many messages are coming and of those most are likely looking for casual sex.  The internet gives men the opportunity to be honest and up front about their desire for casual sex. As a woman, I didn't realize until using these sites the variety and quantity of men who just wanted to fuck me!  \nSo since it is inevitable that some woman will also be looking for casual sex, many of the men looking will find it.  Since less women are likely looking, if all the men who are looking, found it, those women would be fucking villages worth of people.  \n\nWith all that said, I see and respect your sad face.  You can't (I assume) find casual sex anywhere, including online dating sites.  So I'll offer you some advice:\n\nOf the small fraction of women on online dating sites who are primarily looking for casual sex an even smaller fraction of them will come out and say it on their profile.  While I've had plenty of casual sex in my day, I never went looking for it.  Believe it or not, no matter how unlikely the match would turn into a relationship the desire for the potential relationship, or friendship that could lead to meeting more men and a potential relationship, was there.  I might start a date not knowing if a man was relationship material, just someone fun to hang with or someone whom I would have a one night stand with.  Given the situation, I was open to all three outcomes.  \n\nSo when initiating contact online, please say something interesting.  Please show you've read the profile of the lady and you found something in it that sparked up a conversation.  Just because you're looking for casual sex does not mean you can address a stranger online with \"hey baby, let's fuck\", sending a dick pic and requesting a return, or something similar.  Okay, so you've looked at her picture.  You're so horny, and instantly you want to fuck this woman.  I get it... maybe she'd be into that.  Next step:  Read her profile.  If there is anything in it that doesn't fit, jack off and move on.  Next step: You've found a beautiful woman, you've read her profile and think she's actually pretty amazing too...now what to say to her?  Find something in her profile that really got you going.  Like, OMG, she plays video games too, better yet she plays your favorite video games.  You could fire off a quick email saying, \"OMG, I like to playing said video game too!\"  You've done a half ass job.  Lots of dudes love said video game, but you're on your way.  Say something interesting.  For example, \"I see you're into said video game, what did you think of such and such aspect of the game?  I thought it was...  I also like this other game, it's similar yet different in these awesome ways....\"  Then continue on telling her what you're looking for.  It's much better to have your options open and be looking for the possibility of more than casual sex.  If so state this, maybe not in the first message.  Short can be sweet.  But if casual sex is your main bag and your unavailable for anything deeper even with an amazing woman, then you should absolutely tell her before you meet up.  You're going to have a lot better of a chance to get to the point of telling her (in a way she'll care to respond too) if you engage her personally and make her want to CHOOSE you above all the other invites to trade naked photos or comply with the request to just fuck. \nShe will likely also read your profile.  If it's totally boring and you've put no effort into discussing who are and what you want why should she respond?   I don't think many women out there are seriously down to meeting up for half an hour to fuck like animals and move on.  Even when I was totally okay with dates ending in one night stands, there was an actually amazing date that proceeded it.  The individual man was still the selected man above all others in my pursuit.\n\nSo I hope this helps /u/ellevehc and /u/VinceViegel and the 1000s of other men crowding women's online dating profile inboxes with messages that will not be responded to.\nI am not trying to change OP's view.

I don't know, this seems like ok advice but the perspective you have as a woman is limited. You seem to have made an effort to understand the guys and there's some truth in your post but I want to point out a couple things. Firstly, you are mainly speaking from an okcupid perspective where there's lengthy descriptions where you can pick lots of cues from, but on tinder the typica profile is some quote from a song or 4 cucumber emojis in a row and all you've got to work with is 4 to 8 pictures. \n\nThere's one pivotal advice in the post that is absolutely true though: DO SEND SOMETHING INTERESTING FIRST. They are getting HAMMERED with \"hey, what's up!\", or \"Hi! how are you?\", or \"Heey!!\" (Not the \"hey let's fuck\" and dickpics tho, come on, this guy is not THAT clueless). Maybe you'll get someone to reply to these kind of messages if they are feeling like being nice that day, or if they found you interesting by your profile pics (which, judging by your defeatist demeanor, I'm assuming they don't), but that's absolutely not the case, specially with more attractive girls who are used to getting dozens of matches every hour.\n\nYou should absolutely pick some info from their profiles and fire that at them with intentions of sparking a response. They can be sweet, interested, or poking fun at lack of originality of \"basicness\" (being cocky-funny greatly increases the chances a girl will talk to you, they like when someone tells them something they are not used to hear). It could be something related to a hobby, \"Oh, you do elephant riding? I was in the Indonisian Elephant Riding Olympics last year. Didn't win tho, those guys are crazy good\", or related to an interesting detail in a picture, like:\n\nClothing: What is she wearing? Is it kind of \"poser\"-y? Is she wearing a biker leather jacket? Did she get it in a Zara or does she actually ride a bike? If she does, go look up some shit on bikes and hit her from there. Does she have a really good fashion sense? (\"Wow, that's some magazine-level clothing selection. Give me the number of your fashion guy, I need a wardrobe change\"). Is she wearing something really stand-outy? (\"I'm sure that yellow jacket works awesome as a traffic warning signal, can I borrow it tomorrow? I'm going on a night bike ride\")  Does she have tattoos? Do they have a meaning? Who did them? Why did they get them? \n\nSetting: Does she only have pictures of her standing in front of landmarks? (\"The obligatory Niagara falls picture huh? Come on, I'm sure you had better pictures\") Photos in a varied pack of places in the world? (\"Wow, you were in Barcelona? So jealous. [google some recent even on Barcelona]. Just last summer there was this crazy skater gathering and I was this close to saying fuck it and going by myself\")\n\nGeneral vibe of her profile:  Does she only have selfies? (\"How come you only have selfies? You gotta get a friend in there to make the best angles\"). Is she alone in all her pictures? (\"Oh god that's so refreshing. You have no idea how frustrating it is to have to play where's waldo with every single girl on this app/website\") Does she only have shitty cellphone crowd-picture-in-some-random-bar pics? (\"That profile is in dire need of a photographer, I'm 100% sure you could have double the matches if you had nicer pictures. First chance I get to meet you I'm bringing in my camera\")\n\n\nGeneral tips: \n\n1. Do not overdo it with the messaging. Remember, you want this girl to think you are cool. Being calm and collected is a huge factor on this. Downloading a 7 paragraph first message on her listing every single thing on her profile you recognized will either creep her the fuck out or make her look down on you for your obvious showcase of desperation. \n\n2. Be cocky, be funny, be witty, by mysterious. Don't give out all of your personal life the first chance she gets. She asks you what do you do for a living? Tell her you bend spoons into coat hangers in GAP, full time, 70K a year. Backpedal a little bit if she gets tired of your shit, but it's better to reserve the \"letting her getting to know the ACTUAL me\" to an actual face to face date. Remember, the more you talk on Tinder or OKCupid, the less things you'll have to talk about in person. Get a general vibe of her person and her interests, take a few notes and write down some interesting ideas for conversation makers, and do that shit in the actual date. Don't let a tinder match hang in your phone for 2 weeks before you get her number or suggest to go out together. \n\n3. Always make hints that the interaction is going to be moving forward. Drop comments like \"when we meet...\", \"next time I see you...\", \"can't wait to meet that friends of yours...\", \"You are gonna love this restaurant when I take you out...\", \"Can I borrow that X tomorrow...?\", \"I'm going to work right now but i'll hit you up when get back home...\", even if it's a tongue-in-cheek joke. You want her to know that you are not going to back down and at the same time you show initiative and confidence, which, you guessed it, girls absolutely love. \n\n4. It's not WHAT, it's WHY. Why did she decide to study psychology? Whe did she get that Cocker Spaniel instead of a Retriever? Why is her profile name \"Xoxxxzao$$$\" instead of her actual name? How come she likes Gin tonics instead of more girly drinks like a Manhattan or a Sex on the beach? Be as inquisitive as a 5 year old in the backseat of a sedan can be. Most questions will most likely end up in a \"well, I don't know really. I guess I just liked it\". Why DID she like it tho? What motivated it to get to that point? You are not asking her questions just so you can hang in that conversation for 1 minute longer, you ACTUALLY want to get to know her. Show interest, show her you are interested in the actual person behind that makeup, solve her rubbik's cube like nobody before has even bothered to. This works wonder if you want someone to like you, by the way. Not just girls. Just be careful not to overdo it tho, as I said in the first point. This is not an interrogation, it's a date. If it gets to the point where she doesn't even want to answr, you are boring her with the questions. Shift gears, let her catch her breath, show her you get what she is thinking, apologize if you have to, and then move on like it's not a big deal. It really isn't. \n\nLastly, analyze what you REALLY WANT to find out there. If you are anything like me, you are one of those guys that says \"Well, I do want a long term relationship\", but you would absolutely go for casual sex if given the chance (spoiler alert: we are not alone here, I'd say the majority of guys in the 18-27 age range thinks exactly the same). Knowing this, you should get a clear cut of your priorities. If you are interested ina girl for a relationship, be talkative, show interest for her, find out shit (Do keep being witty and cocky any chance you get to, it's important to be consistent, you don't want her thinking you are only putting up a front so you can get to fuck her and then transform into a creeper). If you are interested in a girl for casual sex, you should just cut down the tinder/okcupid talking BY A LOT and ask for her number so you can set up a date INMEDIATELY the moment you get the chance to do it. Go on a date with her, get your act together, don't lose confidence or show weakness, and then rock her world in the bed. But first, as custestlittleasshole pointed out, you HAVE to make the date absolutely amazing too. Women don't fuck guys out of having nothing better to do like we men do. They actually care to be invested emotionally in the guy, even if it just ends up in a one night stand. I know it's easier said than done, but the only way you are going to get to that point of making women find you fascinating and wanting to fuck your brains out is by experience. Don't pussy out, I know you WANT to go out there and have fun. If you didn't, you wouldn't be on tinder or okcupid in the first place. Don't be afraid to be seen as \"one of those assholes that try to get in my pants\", because guess what, that's exactly what you are. Only you are not an asshole. You are a human been with needs just like everyone else, and hey, you actually are putting up the effort to know her. Reconcile yourself with your own feelings and make them your own. \n\nNote: These are some really stupid examples I said in there and I'm sure you are facepalming at them, but I assure you people like it when you can say that stuff with a straight face. Again, the cocky-funny combo works wonders. \n\nNote2: Jeeesus christ this turned out to be waaay longer than I intended it to. Mistake number 1 here, overwhelming people with text. Hope I didn't discourage you, good luck keeping that attention span, I can't even bother to read it back for spelling mistakes.  "}, {"id": "cmti3zy", "body": "Eh....

Reconcile yourself with your own feelings and make them your own. \n\nNote: These are some really stupid examples I said in there and I'm sure you are facepalming at them, but I assure you people like it when you can say that stuff with a straight face.

The \"I have no idea what I'm doing\" question is harder to answer.  Plus, you filled in a lot of the blanks that I left out of my last paragraph.  "}, {"id": "cmt4g0c", "body": "TLDR: Opposing experience for heterosexual men and women, plus tips to find the women online looking for casual sex and how to actually get to the point of meeting up.  \n\nThis totally depends on your gender, given that you are heterosexual (I have no information on what it is like for those with different sexual orientations.)  The experience of straight men and straight women is practically opposite and neither has an incentive to change their behavior.  It's a Nash Equilibrium.  Women are flooded with messages making it more work to initiate connections.  As such men could choose not to initiate contact, but wouldn't get many messages because women are inundated so much.  Thus their main choice is to send many messages to many women with little attachment to each.  Similar to cold calls in marketing, to be successful men would have to send many messages hoping to get a hit and not emotionally attach themselves to any one woman prior to receiving a response.  This non attachment perhaps gives the advantage to men who are looking for casual sex versus men who are looking for relationships.  That said if you're a woman looking for casual sex, well, why even go online when you could just smile and be friendly/flirty to men you see around town.  Thus for a woman it's quite easy to find casual sex because so many messages are coming and of those most are likely looking for casual sex.  The internet gives men the opportunity to be honest and up front about their desire for casual sex. As a woman, I didn't realize until using these sites the variety and quantity of men who just wanted to fuck me!  \nSo since it is inevitable that some woman will also be looking for casual sex, many of the men looking will find it.  Since less women are likely looking, if all the men who are looking, found it, those women would be fucking villages worth of people.  \n\nWith all that said, I see and respect your sad face.  You can't (I assume) find casual sex anywhere, including online dating sites.  So I'll offer you some advice:\n\nOf the small fraction of women on online dating sites who are primarily looking for casual sex an even smaller fraction of them will come out and say it on their profile.  While I've had plenty of casual sex in my day, I never went looking for it.  Believe it or not, no matter how unlikely the match would turn into a relationship the desire for the potential relationship, or friendship that could lead to meeting more men and a potential relationship, was there.  I might start a date not knowing if a man was relationship material, just someone fun to hang with or someone whom I would have a one night stand with.  Given the situation, I was open to all three outcomes.  \n\nSo when initiating contact online, please say something interesting.  Please show you've read the profile of the lady and you found something in it that sparked up a conversation.  Just because you're looking for casual sex does not mean you can address a stranger online with \"hey baby, let's fuck\", sending a dick pic and requesting a return, or something similar.  Okay, so you've looked at her picture.  You're so horny, and instantly you want to fuck this woman.  I get it... maybe she'd be into that.  Next step:  Read her profile.  If there is anything in it that doesn't fit, jack off and move on.  Next step: You've found a beautiful woman, you've read her profile and think she's actually pretty amazing too...now what to say to her?  Find something in her profile that really got you going.  Like, OMG, she plays video games too, better yet she plays your favorite video games.  You could fire off a quick email saying, \"OMG, I like to playing said video game too!\"  You've done a half ass job.  Lots of dudes love said video game, but you're on your way.  Say something interesting.  For example, \"I see you're into said video game, what did you think of such and such aspect of the game?  I thought it was...  I also like this other game, it's similar yet different in these awesome ways....\"  Then continue on telling her what you're looking for.  It's much better to have your options open and be looking for the possibility of more than casual sex.  If so state this, maybe not in the first message.  Short can be sweet.  But if casual sex is your main bag and your unavailable for anything deeper even with an amazing woman, then you should absolutely tell her before you meet up.  You're going to have a lot better of a chance to get to the point of telling her (in a way she'll care to respond too) if you engage her personally and make her want to CHOOSE you above all the other invites to trade naked photos or comply with the request to just fuck. \nShe will likely also read your profile.  If it's totally boring and you've put no effort into discussing who are and what you want why should she respond?   I don't think many women out there are seriously down to meeting up for half an hour to fuck like animals and move on.  Even when I was totally okay with dates ending in one night stands, there was an actually amazing date that proceeded it.  The individual man was still the selected man above all others in my pursuit.\n\nSo I hope this helps /u/ellevehc and /u/VinceViegel and the 1000s of other men crowding women's online dating profile inboxes with messages that will not be responded to.\nI am not trying to change OP's view.  In fact, I'm not sure where I stand on whether or not online dating has had a profound negative effect on dating. \n\nEdit: to add TLDR"}, {"id": "cmtyq8m", "body": "&gt;an even smaller fraction of them will come out and say it on their profile.\n\nThis is the only thing that is true, girls just have higher standards than guys.

And this effect isn't a bad thing.  People who aren't willing to put the work in can move on easily, but people who are can be done with those people quickly and move on to someone who is more compatible.\n\nOkCupid and eHarmony, while coming from opposite sides of the spectrum, both make compatibility of personality a key part of who they match you with.

Given that we represent about 3% of the population, it's fucking hard to meet another gay person that I'd be interested in organically. Sure maybe I'll run into the occasional obvious gay guy in a gym or somewhere, but chances are we don't share the same interests. Of course there's gay bars if I'm near a major city, but those primarily cater to a certain type of clientele. Now, with a site like OK cupid, I can narrow down to that 3%. Then down to just guys that want a relationship. I can even select for just guys that seem to share similar interests. I'm guessing you'll probably concede at this point that it's beneficial for gay people, but stop and think about all the minorities within the heterosexual population. Religion is very important to a lot of use and generally most people I know want to marry within their own religion. There are even fewer jewish people here than there are gay people and that's one of the larger religions in the U.S. Then there are other things people might want to select for. What if you're a vegan and you would much rather prefer a partner who is vegan as well? They don't exactly have bars for that. I guess you could just chat up skinny hipsters in whole foods though so maybe that example falls apart. Maybe you're 50 and you find it impossible to meet someone your own age and feel silly going to a singles bar? If you're a relatively normal, young, straight, and have no qualms about dating someone of any faith, then yeah you don't really need online dating.

Alright, bear with me for a minute.\n\nSo there's this country called Foldr. The main export of this country is origami mobiles. All the boys in Foldr make origami swans, and all the girls make mobiles to hang them from. Every boy wants to meet a cool mobile maker, and every girl wants to find a cool origami folder.\n\nFor historic reasons, guys usually send samples of their work to the ladies, although ladies sometimes send mini mobiles to the guys. Boys sit down for minutes at a time writing their contact info on pieces of paper, folding them into swans, and dumping them on girls' doorsteps hoping one of them will reply. Paper is cheap, and guys are desperate. The problem for ladies is that there are way too many swans to look through, so they just unfold the prettiest ones, leaving tons of swans by the wayside. They don't worry about the ones they throw out, because they know there'll be a new pile the next morning.\n\nNow, global warming has decimated forests, and lumber prices have increased. The price of paper has risen so high that guys can only afford to make one sample every day. Ladies used to get tons of swans to go through, but now the pickings are slim.\n\nWhat happens? Well, a few possiblities:\n\n1) Oil prices have been low for years, and plastic mobiles are still cheap to make. The ladies decide to send out more samples. Guys, even lousy folders, are suddenly seeing a sizable number of mobiles in their front yard. The tables have turned!\n\n2) Ladies hear about a cool country called Plentiful Origami Folders where paper prices are still low, so they emigrate en masse.

Alright, bear with me for a minute.\n\nSo there's this country called Foldr. The main export of this country is origami mobiles. All the boys in Foldr make origami swans, and all the girls make mobiles to hang them from. Every boy wants to meet a cool mobile maker, and every girl wants to find a cool origami folder.\n\nFor historic reasons, guys usually send samples of their work to the ladies, although ladies sometimes send mini mobiles to the guys. Boys sit down for minutes at a time writing their contact info on pieces of paper, folding them into swans, and dumping them on girls' doorsteps hoping one of them will reply. Paper is cheap, and guys are desperate. The problem for ladies is that there are way too many swans to look through, so they just unfold the prettiest ones, leaving tons of swans by the wayside. They don't worry about the ones they throw out, because they know there'll be a new pile the next morning.\n\nNow, global warming has decimated forests, and lumber prices have increased. The price of paper has risen so high that guys can only afford to make one sample every day. Ladies used to get tons of swans to go through, but now the pickings are slim.\n\nWhat happens? Well, a few possiblities:\n\n1) Oil prices have been low for years, and plastic mobiles are still cheap to make. The ladies decide to send out more samples. Guys, even lousy folders, are suddenly seeing a sizable number of mobiles in their front yard. The tables have turned!\n\n2) Ladies hear about a cool country called Plentiful Origami Folders where paper prices are still low, so they emigrate en masse. Guys follow, and the economy of Foldr collapses.\n\n3) Citizens revolt, and the Foldr government has no choice but to subsidize the price of paper. Business as usual resumes.\n\nI think /u/restatic is banking on (1) happening.

The analogy wasn't supposed to focus on production but on advertising. The country outputs the product of partnerships; men produce one half of the product and women produce the other; both men and women share samples to find good partners.\n\nIn the analogy, the changes in prices weren't meant to affect the country's production, just how much spare material the guys and girls could give away in samples. Both guys and girls want to work with the other, but guys sell themselves more frequently than women do. Limiting the amount of chances for guys to sell themselves might encourage women to seek men out more (at least that's how I understood the argument).\n\n&gt; I don't feel treated like a second-class citizen when the price of chocolate goes up.

The reality is that people in relationships aren't ever 100% compatible on every little thing, but when browsing profiles, people tend to be more unforgiving.\n\nHowever, I don't think it's really any different than going out to meet people.  If you spend a night out in a bar, or at a party or something and are generally actively trying to meet people, how many of the opposite sex are you going to even see with your eyes that meet your criteria to even go talk to (within your age range, attractive to you, etc)?  How many will you have the time to get around to meeting?  Plenty will just not even logistically be in your vicinity. Some will be surrounded by friends and you'll see no opening to get in there and chat or dance.  How many don't live in the area and are just visiting, making a real relationship much less likely?\n\nOnline dating sites are just so much more efficient at presenting an available pool of possibilities, even if you are discounting twice as many profiles as you would if you met those same people in person, you're still being presented with many orders of magnitude more options.

And we both actually have to like eachother.\n\nIt's called \"online dating\" but if you're building a relationship online, you are doing it wrong.

We are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all. We up-sell one another all the time. Relationships are harder to maintain because THE second things become difficult, we can simply browse online for another potential match and go from there.\n\nOnline dating creates unrealistic expectations... Men/women are checked against a laundry list of required attributes and are disqualified if they don't meet everyone. \n\nIt cheapens sex. We view each others as items that can be disregarded at a moments notice. Finally, online dating has profoundly negative effects on people who are not desirable.I for one can say that online dating has altered to way I view my own race. It is not a very pleasant realization to come to after facing rejection.\n\n**TLDR: Online dating is making us increasingly shallow and cheapening sex. I think that we as a society would be better served if I did not exist**  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

For me, I'm polyamorous... I have three girlfriends (and one of those has a boyfriend and two other lovers), but even when I'm single I'm always a polyamorous person.  I don't really feel jealousy and I know I don't work out with monogamous people.\n\nSo for people like me, just meeting people to date is really difficult.  Most of the women I meet that I like and that like me are just fundamentally incompatible.  Services like OKCupid are incredibly helpful... I can just set poly related questions to mandatory, and ignore anyone below a 90% match rating.  Suddenly I'm only looking at women that I have base line compatibility with, and that's wonderful."}]}
