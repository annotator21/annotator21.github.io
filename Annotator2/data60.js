Your viewpoint was a similar to what I had in college.

No one has ever asked me about my grades working nor have they even asked for my a copy of my diploma.

For example, Management Consulting firms, law schools etc.  \n\nIf you want to get into a Masters program (you may have interest in this later depending on your job status.) you'll need better grades to qualify for the program.  Several jobs as you get more experienced are starting to require a higher degree since a lot of people now are getting Bachelors as a minimum.  Some larger companies also sort applicants based on GPA when you first get started when reviewing applications.\n\nSo I would say being at the top of a class would be helpful and better than the bottom of the class.  Meeting a minimum GPA to qualify for a Masters program would also be a lot more valuable than just passing.

If we say \"you have  to wait 'til you're shot at in order to shoot,\" we're saying several things:\n\n* We're telling the public we don't care as much about our police as we do about our civilians (ordering them to even further risk their lives).\n\n* We're telling crooks that if they get the first shot off, they can get away clean if they make sure it kills the cop.\n\nAlso, something I didn't think about:\n\nPointing a gun is technically assault. There's a whole separate charge for it. Because it's just one finger twitch away from murder. In your scenario of \"police must shoot second,\" what happens if a guy corners a cop, pointing a gun at him, and walks up to the cop, closer and closer? Is the cop allowed to shoot him? Because the closer the guy gets, the more likely he is to hit and kill the cop when he shoots. \n\nWhat about the case of a suicide bomber, God forbid? Someone with a hostage and a gun to their head? That's guaranteed fatality. Are you going to let them get the first shot off? I don't think so.\n\nI understand where you're coming from, but you're looking at a very specific type of encounter, when the fact is that the types of encounters vary wildly. You're looking at one or two cops who have drawn their guns, pointing at a person who may or may not be armed, who is roughly 6-12 feet away from them, where every party is aware of the other.\n\nBut that's not always how it's going to be.

With that in mind, loss of life to suspects should also be a priority. Knowing that a gunshot wound doesn't necessarily stop a perpetrator immediately, I'm less inclined to believe that a gun is going to have more impact than, say, a beanbag round; they have approximately equal stopping force, given a situation where a weapon is known or suspected, and the beanbag round comes with a lower likelihood of loss of life.\n\nGranted, criminals are always seeking an edge. This is why the expectation for police is to have additional training, and to operate calmly in stressful situations. A handgun doesn't, on its own, save police officers; it's the training and skilled use of that weapon that helps keep officers alive. Presumably those same tactics could be applied to \"non-lethal\" rounds, to give officers situational control while still limiting the loss of life for those people who are often pushed beyond reason and decide that death at the hands of the police is an acceptable risk/outcome."}, {"id": "cmi6d0p", "body": "I would like to see a police force armed only with non-lethal rounds or means of subduing criminals.\n\nBut that's just me.\n\nIf we were spending thousands of dollars on tasers, non-lethal tear gas, bean bag rounds, and the like, I would give absolutely zero fucks.

For another, keep this in mind: That bullet doesn't just vanish the moment it fails to hit its primary target. It keeps traveling, until it hits a wall... or the ground... or someone's car... or a little girl walking across the street. Every time the trigger is pulled, that's someone else that can die. And a police officer is A: going to be, as you pointed out, more accurate, so more likely to hit his target and not have as much collateral damage, and B: going to *give a fuck* what's behind his target, and will thus be careful not to shoot if he could hit a civilian. Police are *meticulously* trained to avoid civilian casualties, and in a lot of cases, they'll refrain from firing even if they think they can hit the guy, if there are civilians behind him. \n\n&gt;If an officer is shot by an unskilled perpetrator it is less likely to be a fatal shot.\n\nI do not wish to offend, but this is an opinion born from ignorance. Gunshot wounds are *exceptionally* traumatic, and due to shock, bleeding and all kinds of complicating factors, a normally nonlethal shot like an arm-shot can still cause death. \n\n&gt; Police can wear teflon vests and other armor to protect themselves.\n\nThe \"bulletproof\" vests police wear will not protect against slugs fired from a shotgun, or against any type of long rifle. Hell, even some handgun calibers and rounds can penetrate them. Besides that, the vests don't protect other areas like the head, arms and legs, all of which, as I mentioned previously, can be fatal.\n\nAdd to this the fact that most engagements take place within 10 yards. You don't have to be an expert marksman to put a bullet in someone from 10 yards. If I'm within 10 yards of you and I wait for you to fire the first shot, I'm one of  two things: extremely lucky, or dead. \n\nDo you think police as a whole *want* to kill people? They don't. Do you think the governing bodies that make the rules of engagement want civilians to end up dead? They sure as hell don't. The reason there isn't a \"shoot second\" policy is because that ends up with more dead cops and fewer people to stop a shooting spree. \n\nYou say that your average thug isn't as good a shot as a police officer. You're probably right, there. But not everyone police draw on will be your average thug. It could be an ex-military guy that can outshoot every cop there. Also, let's just assume for a minute that the thug is *vastly* inaccurate at 10 yards. Say he is using a handgun, and he shoots 5 rounds and hits one. That's a 20% hit rate. At what point does it become an unacceptable risk? What if he hits 2 out of 5? 40%? What about 60%? 80%? 100% hit rate, each time he pulls the trigger a cop dies?\n\nWhen police draw on someone, they don't know what they're dealing with. They have no way of knowing whether this is some prick that learned everything he knows about guns from thugs in the movies, or if he's a former pistol shooting world champion who's gone off the deep end. Depending on which he is, that first shot can sail wildly, or it can put a cop or his best friend in the ground.\n\nSo who do you want shooting first: a random, completely uncontrolled individual we know nothing about, save that he's armed, dangerous and unpredictable; or a police officer who's had marksmanship training and has been trained to put the safety of the public above his own life?

A reasonable person in the same situation would be in fear for their life or serious bodily harm (or that of another person - I know that makes it not really *self* defense, but the self-defense law applies). AND\n\n2. The person using defensive force was not otherwise committing a felony (so you can't break into someone's house and then claim you feared for your life when the owner comes at you with a bat).\n\nThat's basically it. There are some details that individual states add, but for the most part if you are claiming self-defense in a case where you hurt or killed someone, a prosecutor would have to disprove one of those two points to prove your guilt.\n\nSo in your opinion, even if a cop fears for his or another's life, they cannot use deadly force until after the assailant has actually taken an action. This basically renders the police useless in defending others, and I'd be willing to bet that if this policy actually existed cops would never enter a dangerous situation without a swat team, and very rarely before someone had been killed.\n\nEDIT: I am not a lawyer, I'm just well-read on a few states' self-defense laws.

It's a popular handgun for a reason, but one to two shots often won't incapacitate someone, especially if they're running on adrenaline and/or certain drugs (hello PCP). \n\nIf someone is running at you with a knife, how far away do you, OP, think you have to fire to stop him without getting stabbed? If you said anything short of 20 feet, congrats, you've died. [The Tueller Drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tueller_Drill) is done because an attacker can cover ~20 feet in a second and a half. Drills are done from a holstered position, but assume an instant kill. Anything outside of a direct head shot would put the officer at risk. Hell, Mythbusters even tested it.\n\nTasers and mace have an even lesser effect. All the gas training I've had to put up with sucked major ass, but at no point would CS gas have stopped me from stabbing someone if I really wanted to.\n\nIt also just doesn't make sense vs armed aggressors. There is no personal body armor available that will stop a hunting rifle shot to the face. Why would you give a perpetrator the opportunity to fire first? Pointing a deadly weapon at an officer (or anyone for that matter) is threat enough to immediately shoot him/her. \n\nNonlethal options are great but not nearly as effective as a handgun. Mace won't incapacitate everyone, and those that it works on, it often won't work quick enough. Tasers are single-shot only, so if you're facing more than one person or you miss you're toast. Wrestling the person to the ground is a good way to get stabbed yourself - or you just might lose the fight. \n\ntl:dr: Allowing a \"shoot second\" puts the officer at a gigantic unnecessary risk when dealing with dangerous criminals.

Not following this results in plenty of tragedy every year.  When in a high adrenaline situation, such as responding to someone wielding a firearm (or something that looks a lot like one) your response is measured to assume that person is intent on firing.\n\nGiving your opponent the opportunity to shoot you first does nothing to reduce the threat to yourself or others.

A firearm response gives the officer range on the perpetrator and a greater level of stopping power vs non-lethal methods.  \n\nWhile serve and protect is how our police operate, they must also consider their own lives and going home to their families.

I'd prefer if we could stay away from cherry picking in this CMV, and stick to broader more measurable ways of determining which sex it is more difficult to be. I've had similar discussions about this before, and it turns into one side citing cherry picks and me finding equivalent or worse cherry picks on the other side of the coin. These are subjective and don't lead anywhere. The scope should be limited to the United States, as I do not deny that it is much harder to be a woman than a man elsewhere.\n\nThe main points behind my view are that men are on average unhappier than women, and live an average of 5 years less than women. I consider these two points to be the most important, and if these two are refuted my view will be changed regardless of whether or not the following are refuted.\n\nOther more minor points are society's predilection to place a motivation of competitiveness in men, as opposed to women. Men are perceived as better leaders, and are often placed in positions of power and/or leadership, which are more stressful and difficult to handle than lower positions (i.e. it is easier to be a homemaker than to have a job [and men have shown to work more stressful jobs than women], the president of an organization, albeit more powerful, has more to worry about than a member of the organization that holds no power). Men are expected to be the providers for a family, while their wives are not.\n\nThe expectations for men, similarly, are much higher, and men must compete more and do more to reach the same feeling of accomplishment than do women.\n\nThese high expectations also provide other difficulties that a woman would not face should her sex be different. When it comes to college and job applications, men are at a disadvantage when companies or university's favor diversity over qualifications. The expectation that men are more competent than women in the workplace leaves men with tasked with greater and more stressful responsibilities in the workplace, while women are given less stressful jobs. This also leads to men helping or doing tasks that are tasked to women, because of the stereotype that a man helping would improve the efficiency of the task done, creating a dependence of female co-workers on men.\n\nMen have a stereotype of being more powerful and violent, which leads to longer sentences and higher conviction rates in court, and for female opponents to be favored.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You're more likely to go to jail over gang related violence than prostitution.\n\n&gt;For every 100 American women who earn a bachelor\u2019s degree from college 75 American men earn a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nAgain, men are more likely to go into a trade than get a bachelor degree. More men are employed than females despite your statistic. It's easier to get a job with a trade than a degree and it's easier to get a trade as a male than as a female.\n\n&gt;For every 100 girls expelled from public elementary and secondary schools 297 boys are expelled.\n\nAgain, boys are more likely to be physical and girls are more likely to be subtle. Two boys are going to fight. That's easy to suspend. Two girls are going to tease and spread rumors about each other. Much harder to suspend/be expelled over.\n\n&gt;We've turned our backs on these boys and began drugging instead of raising them.\n\nOne more time. Boys with ADD/ADHD are fidgety, are easier to see. Girls with ADD/ADHD suffer the same attention deficit disorder but it's harder to diagnose because they are more likely to be daydreaming therefore they don't fit what most people \"perceive\" the disorder to be and therefore go undiagnosed.\n\nThe whole point of my post is that neither sex has it \"worse\" than the other in America.

I'd prefer if we could stay away from cherry picking in this CMV, and stick to broader more measurable ways of determining which sex it is more difficult to be. I've had similar discussions about this before, and it turns into one side citing cherry picks and me finding equivalent or worse cherry picks on the other side of the coin. These are subjective and don't lead anywhere. The scope should be limited to the United States, as I do not deny that it is much harder to be a woman than a man elsewhere.\n\nThe main points behind my view are that men are on average unhappier than women, and live an average of 5 years less than women. I consider these two points to be the most important, and if these two are refuted my view will be changed regardless of whether or not the following are refuted.\n\nOther more minor points are society's predilection to place a motivation of competitiveness in men, as opposed to women. Men are perceived as better leaders, and are often placed in positions of power and/or leadership, which are more stressful and difficult to handle than lower positions (i.e. it is easier to be a homemaker than to have a job [and men have shown to work more stressful jobs than women], the president of an organization, albeit more powerful, has more to worry about than a member of the organization that holds no power). Men are expected to be the providers for a family, while their wives are not.\n\nThe expectations for men, similarly, are much higher, and men must compete more and do more to reach the same feeling of accomplishment than do women.\n\nThese high expectations also provide other difficulties that a woman would not face should her sex be different. When it comes to college and job applications, men are at a disadvantage when companies or university's favor diversity over qualifications. The expectation that men are more competent than women in the workplace leaves men with tasked with greater and more stressful responsibilities in the workplace, while women are given less stressful jobs. This also leads to men helping or doing tasks that are tasked to women, because of the stereotype that a man helping would improve the efficiency of the task done, creating a dependence of female co-workers on men.\n\nMen have a stereotype of being more powerful and violent, which leads to longer sentences and higher conviction rates in court, and for female opponents to be favored.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Also working women are less populous than men, and much more men than women gain the benefits of working a higher-paying job simply from being married to the man making the money.\n\nThe case with economic power is one of two cases assuming a married couple of both sexes.\n\nA. Husband is breadwinner, and makes more money than women on average, wife gains the same economic power as her husband, with less of the work put in.\n\nB.

There are some cases where women have a more difficult life after having a child, but the average case isn't a single mother with an anonymous father trying to raise a child while moving forward with a career. The average case is taking on the role of a homemaker rather than a career, and gaining financial support from multiple sources to take care of the child, or to simply not have the child at all due to adoption/abortion."}, {"id": "cmi9bdi", "body": "&gt; And I'd argue that the wage gap isn't because of any discrimination or from women getting paid less for the same difficulty of work, but because women don't work as hard as men. Also working women are less populous than men, and much more men than women gain the benefits of working a higher-paying job simply from being married to the man making the money.\n\nAnd you'd be disagreeing with established research which shows that at least a full 10% of the wage gap cannot be explained by any of that and currently can only be explained by discrimination and simply paying women less.\n\nAnd where did your \"less populous\" comment come from? Last I saw women made up over 47% of the workforce so while technically yes, that is less populous, it's not enough that it would actually make any difference. Finally, on average yes men are more likely to work longer hours, but that is not directly comparable to \"working as hard as men\" and thus you cannot draw that conclusion. For example, if two people work just as hard, but one is simply better or more productive than the other they will finish sooner. So all you can conclude is that men are more likely to work longer hours however a little bit a research shows you why. The jobs that often *require* longer hours? Are overwhelmingly male. Surgeons, Doctors, Lawyers, and so on. These jobs are the ones that primarily end up working longer and longer hours and these jobs are primarily male thus resulting in \"men are more likely to work longer hours\". This says nothing about whether men work \"harder than women\". \n\nFinally, your comment about being \"Married to the man making the money\" is pretty ridiculous when you're arguing about the fact that men in general make more money than women so of course more women than men will have a spouse who makes more money than them (specifically because gay and lesbian marriages aren't legal in all states and are a relatively small subset of hte population). Ultimately, nothing you've said actually proves your point.\n\n&gt; The man in B. has less economic power than the average man from the wage gap that he consequently suffers from, the man in A. has it more difficult than the average woman in the same economic situation because he must work for the money.\n\nThis is false. The woman in the \"same economic situation\" as the man in A, would be the woman in B who is *also working for the money* just like the man is. Thus when comparing the same economic position in the way you are it's the same by your standards regardless of whether you are a man or woman.\n\n&gt; Lack of power is not more difficulty. Being in power is more likely than not more difficult than being in power in most cases.\n\nThis is plainly false. If you don't have hte power to change and affect the issues which make life difficult for you it is much more difficult than someone who **is** in the position to change and affect those issues which affect them. Lack of power is most definitely more difficult than having power.\n\n&gt; I'd argue that paying for a child is more difficult than carrying it and going through childbirth. Risk of death is incredibly low (on the whole men live 5 years less than women so any arguments towards death are moot), and they have the option of either receiving financial aid or not having/taking care of the child, while men do not. The lack of career is changed to homemaking, which is easier than holding a career.\n\nThis is all kinds of false. First of all, if we're talking about a married couple, then you have two people working together while the woman carries the child and goes through childbirth (and frequently still works for most of the pregnancy!) while the man just continues to work. Then (hopefully) they work together raising the child. You can't say that \"paying for the child\" is more difficult because both are paying for it and because the man doesn't have to go through the physical and psychological trauma that the woman does. In the case of this married couple financial aid isn't a consideration unless the man doesn't make enough money in which then *both* are receiving the aid and you can't say that this is *just for women* as that is entirely false. Finally, choosing to not take care of the child (adoption) must legally be decided by both parents. Lastly, while some careers are certainly more difficult than being a stay at home parent, it's absolutely false to claim that being a stay at home parent is *in general* easier than having a career. Go be a parent and then try to say that. I know a multitude of parents (both stay at home and their spouses) who would say that you have no idea what you're talking about and research would back them up."}, {"id": "cmi0ns3", "body": "&gt; For instance I could say that the wage gap as a large generality that is worse for women.

There can be some argument made about nursing/medicine towards difficulty, I agree with you. But the overall theme is that men are much more likely to enter a STEM field, while women are much more likely to enter a less difficult reading-comprehension field.\n\n&gt;You also don't account for lost time and advancement due to childrearing, which is unfairly placed on women because we don't have things like paternity leave in the US.\n\nYes, that happens. Childrearing is less difficult than working. Yes it sets them back in their career, but the setback that they take on is not a difficult one.\n\n&gt;I will agree that women make very close to what men make when doing the same job. I will not agree that women make very close to what men make when doing a different job of the same difficulty.\n\nIt's near-impossible to compare literally every job, and compare their difficulties, but is it fair to say that STEM fields are more difficult than other fields?"}, {"id": "cmi0z4c", "body": "&gt; Men living less long than women has nothing to do with discrimination either\n\nI'm not arguing about discrimination.

Sure, it's a very large generality that relies on looking at averages across the board, and the gap between the average pay to women and men has reasons behind it that are often cited as justifications for it, but the bottom line is that, generally speaking, women have less economic power than men and economic power is hugely significant, and thus women have it worse.\n\nAnd I'd argue that the wage gap isn't because of any discrimination or from women getting paid less for the same difficulty of work, but because women don't work as hard as men. Also working women are less populous than men, and much more men than women gain the benefits of working a higher-paying job simply from being married to the man making the money.\n\nThe case with economic power is one of two cases assuming a married couple of both sexes.\n\nA. Husband is breadwinner, and makes more money than women on average, wife gains the same economic power as her husband, with less of the work put in.\n\nB. Wife is breadwinner, and makes less than men on average, husband gains the same economic power as his wife, with less of the work put in.\n\nThe man in B. has less economic power than the average man from the wage gap that he consequently suffers from, the man in A. has it more difficult than the average woman in the same economic situation because he must work for the money. Women have equal economic power to their husbands, and when women are the breadwinner, husbands of breadwinners have a more difficult time than wives of breadwinners.\n\n&gt;Women in the U.S. are represented in government less than men, therefor we have less government power\n\nLack of power is not more difficulty. Being in power is more likely than not more difficult than being in power in most cases.\n\n&gt;Women bear the physical burden of reproduction which is painful and causes extreme physical and hormonal changes - some permanent - and risks death and causes economic loss and career stagnation\n\nI'd argue that paying for a child is more difficult than carrying it and going through childbirth. Risk of death is incredibly low (on the whole men live 5 years less than women so any arguments towards death are moot), and they have the option of either receiving financial aid or not having/taking care of the child, while men do not. The lack of career is changed to homemaking, which is easier than holding a career.\n\nI'd consider the last one a cherry pick. There are some cases where women have a more difficult life after having a child, but the average case isn't a single mother with an anonymous father trying to raise a child while moving forward with a career. The average case is taking on the role of a homemaker rather than a career, and gaining financial support from multiple sources to take care of the child, or to simply not have the child at all due to adoption/abortion."}, {"id": "cmi18li", "body": "&gt;And I'd argue that the wage gap isn't because of any discrimination or from women getting paid less for the same difficulty of work, but because women don't work as hard as men. \n\nSaying that is like if I argued against your original points by saying men don't have more stress, don't live shorter lives, and aren't pressured to work harder.

"}, {"id": "cmi2q8o", "body": "&gt;That wage gap has been debunked 10 times over. \n\nThat's like saying climate change has been debunked 10 times over. Yes, there have been a great number of articles claiming it doesn't exist, all citing the same fallacious \"thought experiments\". But zero scientific evidence has been presented that proves the point. Just convincing sounding propaganda from conservative think tanks. It's unfortunate that the wage gap has become such a politicized issue. It really shouldn't be. But it is, and that's why people are spinning the truth to \"excuse\" the gap. \n\n&gt;All of the studies I've seen that there is a gap from discrimination, a small one, around $0.03 on the dollar, but the other $0.23 is from not working as hard or from working easier jobs.\n\nEvery study ever done on the subject has found the \"adjusted wage gap\" to be between 5% and 7%. And as I explained \"working easier jobs\" is not proven to be the \"fault\" of women. Never getting a promotion or raise is not a benefit. It is a mechanism by which discrimination causes the wage gap.\n\n&gt;Do they have identical qualifications? Not necessarily. Affirmative action, especially in the Computer Science field can lead to women getting into colleges and getting internships with a lesser GPA.\n\nThat would be an assumption, based on gender. The very definition of discrimination. \n\nThere's no actual proof of that, and you can't reasonably assume that's for certain. So I think that further proves the point\n\n&gt;Do they have identical qualifications? Not necessarily. Affirmative action, especially in the Computer Science field can lead to women getting into colleges and getting internships with a lesser GPA.\n\n&gt;The gender wage gap of an average 3-7%, is more than accounted for the average of 6\" difference in height between men and women.\n\nThe 3 to 7% gap you discuss is the \"adjusted gap\". Meaning you are compensating for factors such as job position. The height gap is \"unadjusted\" meaning you're not compensating for those factors. To be accurate you must compare the height gap to the full 23% wage gap. As differences in job position may also explain some portion of the difference in income between people of different heights. Likewise I would also claim that difference in job position is a mechanism by which people with different heights are sub consciously discriminated against.\n\nIt is unreasonable however to assume that the gender wage gap is caused by the height wage gap. Especially since there are also gaps caused by weight, skin color, nationality, accent, and even things such as left-handedness.\n\nIt becomes clear that being anything besides being a white man causes some loss of salary on average.\n\nMy opinion, as a young white man personally, is that I do have problems in this world. Toxic masculinity, as well as many other stereotypes, cause me difficulties. But to claim that others don't have problems, such as discrimination against women, I think is a very common but unfortunate \"not acknowledging our privilege\" meaning you are unaware of the problems others face because you have not experienced them personally. Just like many women, even many feminists, are unaware of the problems men face such as toxic masculinity and all the inherent pressures and stereotypes. \n\nSo if you really wanted to come up with the answer of \"which is worse\", which in many ways is a pointless exercise.

Sure, it's a very large generality that relies on looking at averages across the board, and the gap between the average pay to women and men has reasons behind it that are often cited as justifications for it, but the bottom line is that, generally speaking, women have less economic power than men and economic power is hugely significant, and thus women have it worse.\n\nAnd I'd argue that the wage gap isn't because of any discrimination or from women getting paid less for the same difficulty of work, but because women don't work as hard as men. Also working women are less populous than men, and much more men than women gain the benefits of working a higher-paying job simply from being married to the man making the money.\n\nThe case with economic power is one of two cases assuming a married couple of both sexes.\n\nA. Husband is breadwinner, and makes more money than women on average, wife gains the same economic power as her husband, with less of the work put in.\n\nB. Wife is breadwinner, and makes less than men on average, husband gains the same economic power as his wife, with less of the work put in.\n\nThe man in B. has less economic power than the average man from the wage gap that he consequently suffers from, the man in A. has it more difficult than the average woman in the same economic situation because he must work for the money. Women have equal economic power to their husbands, and when women are the breadwinner, husbands of breadwinners have a more difficult time than wives of breadwinners.\n\n&gt;Women in the U.S. are represented in government less than men, therefor we have less government power\n\nLack of power is not more difficulty. Being in power is more likely than not more difficult than being in power in most cases.\n\n&gt;Women bear the physical burden of reproduction which is painful and causes extreme physical and hormonal changes - some permanent - and risks death and causes economic loss and career stagnation\n\nI'd argue that paying for a child is more difficult than carrying it and going through childbirth. Risk of death is incredibly low (on the whole men live 5 years less than women so any arguments towards death are moot), and they have the option of either receiving financial aid or not having/taking care of the child, while men do not. The lack of career is changed to homemaking, which is easier than holding a career.\n\nI'd consider the last one a cherry pick. There are some cases where women have a more difficult life after having a child, but the average case isn't a single mother with an anonymous father trying to raise a child while moving forward with a career. The average case is taking on the role of a homemaker rather than a career, and gaining financial support from multiple sources to take care of the child, or to simply not have the child at all due to adoption/abortion."}, {"id": "cmi1pqy", "body": "IRRELEVANT! *ALL* of your comments arguing my specific points are irrelevant.

Men use firearms and hanging more often.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide#Differing_methods_by_gender) \n\n&gt; The wage gap only exists if you don't control for education, experience, job choices, etc, and you don't count all the unemployed and/or homeless people, populations that are predominantly male.\n\nThe jury is out on this one. I've seen convincing arguments and stats from both sides of this debate. My current understanding is that for older people without university degrees, who are a majority of the population, the gendered wage gap does indeed exist. Also, [more women are unemployed than men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_in_the_United_States#mediaviewer/File:US_Labor_Participation_Rate_1948-2011_by_gender.svg)\n\n&gt; and on the job death, but let's not talk about that, or how it's relevant to any disparity in pay.\n\nThere were [4,405 fatal workplace injuries in the US in 2013](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm) for all genders which works out to 3.2 per 100,000 workers (753 of those were due to homicide or suicide. Most of the homicide victims, oddly enough, were women). [Lung cancer and alcohol killed ten times that many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate). \n\n&gt; I love how you say that you're not going to play the individual responsibility card, only to say that it is, in fact, our fault. Well done.\n\nThat's not what I'm saying. I'm both a man and a recovering alcoholic. I'm saying that although it was the most difficult thing I've ever done, I was able to quit drinking, whereas a woman can't just stop being hassled by dudes every single fucking day every time she walks outside her house\n\n&gt; If the number of women graduating increased rapidly until it hit parity and then things stayed balanced, that'd be one thing, but it didn't\n\nThe point is that more women getting degrees doesn't make it more difficult for men to get degrees, as both genders are getting more degrees than ever before, and universities want as many students as possible"}, {"id": "cmk5gyt", "body": "&gt; also, a cult of militarism that idealizes the soldier to the point of religiosity\n\nThe cult of the soldier does not give a damn about the *individual* until they're dead.  Otherwise, the entire country would be up in arms about the blatant failings of the VA, would not accept the insane number of veterans who end up homeless.  In other words, it glorifies the *uniform* not the people who wear/wore it.\n\nBut you missed my point, where men are objectified to the point of literally being treated as fodder to be *sent to die.*  I'd rather a scenario where no one cared about me as a person than one where no one cared about me *and* sent me to die.\n\n&gt; Men use firearms and hanging more often.[1] \n\nHanging is pretty darn clean, as is CO poisoning, which undermines your \"women aren't successful because they want to be tidy\" assertion.\n\n&gt; Also, more women are unemployed than men\n\nThat's not what that graphic says.  Unemployment is people who don't have jobs that want to have jobs.  Labor Participation is number of people who don't work.  The latter number includes stay at home parents (many more of which are female than male, by their respective choice) and the idle rich, the former does not.  That graphic shows that 10% fewer women than men have jobs?  Well, [24 percent of married-couple family groups with children under 15 had a stay-at-home mother](http://www.infoplease.com/spot/momcensus1.html), which is going to have a pretty decent impact on that...\n\n\n&gt; Most of the homicide victims, oddly enough, were women\n\nHere's your problem: You completely fail at understanding the numbers before you.  From the link you shared:\n\n&gt;  The **homicide total** was lower in 2013, falling 16 percent to **397** from 475 in 2012. Shootings were the most frequent \nmanner of death in both homicides (80 percent) and suicides (47 percent). **Of the 302 fatal work injuries involving \nfemale workers, 22 percent involved homicides,** compared to 8 percent for men. [Emphasis added]\n\nLet's actually think about what that means, shall we?  22% of the 302 fatal workplace injuries women suffered were homicides.  That comes out to 66 or 67 total.  For the sake of argument, let's go with the larger number.  That means that 67 of the 397 homicide victims were women.  That's only about 17% of the total.  In other words, as everywhere else in American society, men are still the overwhelming majority of homicide victims.\n\nFurther, even if 100% of the male homicide victims were women, (taking 330 deaths from men, and adding them to women), then men would still be nearly 7 times more likely to die on the job than women.  As it stands, however, back in reality, men are more likely to die from on-the-job *homicide* than women are to die on the job for *any* reason, and over 14 times more likely to die on the job in general.\n\n&gt; whereas a woman can't just stop being hassled by dudes every single fucking day every time she walks outside her house\n\nAnd when that harassment has a greater impact on their life than the harassment about \"not being a man\" if they don't drink \"manly\" drinks to the point of drunkenness had on your life and the lives of so many other men, then *and only then* will I concede that the two scenarios are comparable.\n\n&gt; The point is that more women getting degrees doesn't make it more difficult for men to get degrees\n\nNo, the point is that boys are systematically in primary and secondary school, to the point that by the time they get to college application time, the only rational response is to select mostly women, because nobody *cared* that a large number of boys were barely passing.\n\nAlso, yes, actually, more women being admitted to university *does* make it more difficult for men to get in, because while universities want as many students as possible, there *is* a maximum number of students admitted.  Otherwise why would they turn *anybody* away?\n"}, {"id": "cmi3hwz", "body": "- Men rarely/never find themselves not being taken seriously for being men, which obviously contributes to quality of life and self-image\n\n- Men rarely/never find themselves being objectified to the point of being dismissed as a real person\n\n- Women have much worse self-image than men on average\n\n- Women attempt suicide more often than men, though succeed in dying less often.

I'd prefer if we could stay away from cherry picking in this CMV, and stick to broader more measurable ways of determining which sex it is more difficult to be. I've had similar discussions about this before, and it turns into one side citing cherry picks and me finding equivalent or worse cherry picks on the other side of the coin. These are subjective and don't lead anywhere. The scope should be limited to the United States, as I do not deny that it is much harder to be a woman than a man elsewhere.\n\nThe main points behind my view are that men are on average unhappier than women, and live an average of 5 years less than women. I consider these two points to be the most important, and if these two are refuted my view will be changed regardless of whether or not the following are refuted.\n\nOther more minor points are society's predilection to place a motivation of competitiveness in men, as opposed to women. Men are perceived as better leaders, and are often placed in positions of power and/or leadership, which are more stressful and difficult to handle than lower positions (i.e. it is easier to be a homemaker than to have a job [and men have shown to work more stressful jobs than women], the president of an organization, albeit more powerful, has more to worry about than a member of the organization that holds no power). Men are expected to be the providers for a family, while their wives are not.\n\nThe expectations for men, similarly, are much higher, and men must compete more and do more to reach the same feeling of accomplishment than do women.\n\nThese high expectations also provide other difficulties that a woman would not face should her sex be different. When it comes to college and job applications, men are at a disadvantage when companies or university's favor diversity over qualifications. The expectation that men are more competent than women in the workplace leaves men with tasked with greater and more stressful responsibilities in the workplace, while women are given less stressful jobs. This also leads to men helping or doing tasks that are tasked to women, because of the stereotype that a man helping would improve the efficiency of the task done, creating a dependence of female co-workers on men.\n\nMen have a stereotype of being more powerful and violent, which leads to longer sentences and higher conviction rates in court, and for female opponents to be favored.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'd prefer if we could stay away from cherry picking in this CMV, and stick to broader more measurable ways of determining which sex it is more difficult to be. I've had similar discussions about this before, and it turns into one side citing cherry picks and me finding equivalent or worse cherry picks on the other side of the coin. These are subjective and don't lead anywhere. The scope should be limited to the United States, as I do not deny that it is much harder to be a woman than a man elsewhere.\n\nFirst, your whole \"cherry-picking\" bit is a bunch of bullshit and let me tell you why. Using statistics and quantifiable measures isn't \"cherry-picking,\" it's called using evidence to support your argument. Second, your \"broader more measurable ways\" of determining ease of life are actually just a bunch of bullshit anecdotal points with no scholastic credibility, but regardless: \n \n1. First, the easy quantifiable metric. Women make $0.77 for every dollar a man earns. This is true. No matter how you manipulate the dependent variables, women always in every situation make less than men, without fail. Why? Because men like you, who believe men work so much harder so they deserve more recognition or pay. The root of your grievances is your own sexism.\n\n2. Women face 83% of all workplace sexual harassment charges in the US. They are by far the majority of victims of sexual violence. Women are by and large the victims of rape in the world. \n\n3. Men don't have their bodily autonomy regulated and legislated by the government. \n\n4. Men aren't regularly dehumanized and treated like objects, victims of [benevolent sexism](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2014/02/24/women-are-kind-and-men-are-strong-how-benevolent-sexism-hurts-us-all/). Actually, benevolent sexism is deeply ingrained in your entire argument and the root cause for all of the problems you claim to be plaguing men so badly.\n\n5. Men are not regularly told that any decision they make is wrong. Woman doesn't have sex, she's a prude. Woman has sex, she's a slut. Woman stays at home with her children, she's a lazy housewife. Woman goes to work and doesn't see her kids, she's a bad mother. Etc. Etc. Good luck drawing any parallels with men. \n\n&gt;The main points behind my view are that men are on average unhappier than women, and live an average of 5 years less than women. I consider these two points to be the most important, and if these two are refuted my view will be changed regardless of whether or not the following are refuted.\n\n1. Happiness is not a reliable metric for measuring quality of life. Read all about it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life. Also, we're gonna need some serious sources on the claim that men are on average unhappier, because this by far does not seem to be the case. If we're using anecdotal evidence, then let me say that the majority of people I know that suffer from depression and anxiety are women, so in my experience women are a lot more unhappy than men. \n\n2. Life span is a biological function, and is also no measure of quality of life or standard of living. If you want to include biological functions in how much harder life is, why not talk about how women have to endure menstrual cramping and bleeding once a month for well over half their lifetime. But obviously you didn't cherrypick that bit because it'd hurt your stance. Also, I don't see how lifespan has any relevance because when you die, you die, you can't be upset about how you died younger than most women, you're dead at that point. If this is a serious argument, this just sounds like a pity party for how hard your extremely easy life is. \n\nSummarized: Your two \"main points of contention\" are moot and if you choose to base those as the core foundations of your argument then sorry you are just stupid and you aren't really concerned about or understand the core of the issue which is not individual happiness or lifespan but more quantifiable population metrics, which overwhelmingly say that men have much better lives everywhere in the world, including the US.\n\n&gt;Other more minor points are society's predilection to place a motivation of competitiveness in men, as opposed to women. Men are perceived as better leaders, and are often placed in positions of power and/or leadership, which are more stressful and difficult to handle than lower positions (i.e. it is easier to be a homemaker than to have a job [and men have shown to work more stressful jobs than women], the president of an organization, albeit more powerful, has more to worry about than a member of the organization that holds no power). Men are expected to be the providers for a family, while their wives are not.\nThe expectations for men, similarly, are much higher, and men must compete more and do more to reach the same feeling of accomplishment than do women.\nThese high expectations also provide other difficulties that a woman would not face should her sex be different. When it comes to college and job applications, men are at a disadvantage when companies or university's favor diversity over qualifications. The expectation that men are more competent than women in the workplace leaves men with tasked with greater and more stressful responsibilities in the workplace, while women are given less stressful jobs. This also leads to men helping or doing tasks that are tasked to women, because of the stereotype that a man helping would improve the efficiency of the task done, creating a dependence of female co-workers on men.\nMen have a stereotype of being more powerful and violent, which leads to longer sentences and higher conviction rates in court, and for female opponents to be favored.\n\nSee benevolent sexism, then read this whole bit.

Men are perceived as better leaders, and are often placed in positions of power and/or leadership, which are more stressful and difficult to handle than lower positions (i.e. it is easier to be a homemaker than to have a job [and men have shown to work more stressful jobs than women], the president of an organization, albeit more powerful, has more to worry about than a member of the organization that holds no power). Men are expected to be the providers for a family, while their wives are not.\nThe expectations for men, similarly, are much higher, and men must compete more and do more to reach the same feeling of accomplishment than do women.\nThese high expectations also provide other difficulties that a woman would not face should her sex be different. When it comes to college and job applications, men are at a disadvantage when companies or university's favor diversity over qualifications. The expectation that men are more competent than women in the workplace leaves men with tasked with greater and more stressful responsibilities in the workplace, while women are given less stressful jobs. This also leads to men helping or doing tasks that are tasked to women, because of the stereotype that a man helping would improve the efficiency of the task done, creating a dependence of female co-workers on men.\nMen have a stereotype of being more powerful and violent, which leads to longer sentences and higher conviction rates in court, and for female opponents to be favored.\n\nSee benevolent sexism, then read this whole bit.

The scope should be limited to the United States, as I do not deny that it is much harder to be a woman than a man elsewhere.\n\nFirst, your whole \"cherry-picking\" bit is a bunch of bullshit and let me tell you why. Using statistics and quantifiable measures isn't \"cherry-picking,\" it's called using evidence to support your argument. Second, your \"broader more measurable ways\" of determining ease of life are actually just a bunch of bullshit anecdotal points with no scholastic credibility, but regardless: \n \n1. First, the easy quantifiable metric. Women make $0.77 for every dollar a man earns. This is true. No matter how you manipulate the dependent variables, women always in every situation make less than men, without fail. Why? Because men like you, who believe men work so much harder so they deserve more recognition or pay. The root of your grievances is your own sexism.\n\n2. Women face 83% of all workplace sexual harassment charges in the US. They are by far the majority of victims of sexual violence. Women are by and large the victims of rape in the world. \n\n3. Men don't have their bodily autonomy regulated and legislated by the government. \n\n4. Men aren't regularly dehumanized and treated like objects, victims of [benevolent sexism](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2014/02/24/women-are-kind-and-men-are-strong-how-benevolent-sexism-hurts-us-all/). Actually, benevolent sexism is deeply ingrained in your entire argument and the root cause for all of the problems you claim to be plaguing men so badly.\n\n5. Men are not regularly told that any decision they make is wrong. Woman doesn't have sex, she's a prude. Woman has sex, she's a slut. Woman stays at home with her children, she's a lazy housewife. Woman goes to work and doesn't see her kids, she's a bad mother. Etc. Etc. Good luck drawing any parallels with men. \n\n&gt;The main points behind my view are that men are on average unhappier than women, and live an average of 5 years less than women. I consider these two points to be the most important, and if these two are refuted my view will be changed regardless of whether or not the following are refuted.\n\n1. Happiness is not a reliable metric for measuring quality of life. Read all about it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life. Also, we're gonna need some serious sources on the claim that men are on average unhappier, because this by far does not seem to be the case. If we're using anecdotal evidence, then let me say that the majority of people I know that suffer from depression and anxiety are women, so in my experience women are a lot more unhappy than men. \n\n2. Life span is a biological function, and is also no measure of quality of life or standard of living. If you want to include biological functions in how much harder life is, why not talk about how women have to endure menstrual cramping and bleeding once a month for well over half their lifetime. But obviously you didn't cherrypick that bit because it'd hurt your stance. Also, I don't see how lifespan has any relevance because when you die, you die, you can't be upset about how you died younger than most women, you're dead at that point. If this is a serious argument, this just sounds like a pity party for how hard your extremely easy life is. \n\nSummarized: Your two \"main points of contention\" are moot and if you choose to base those as the core foundations of your argument then sorry you are just stupid and you aren't really concerned about or understand the core of the issue which is not individual happiness or lifespan but more quantifiable population metrics, which overwhelmingly say that men have much better lives everywhere in the world, including the US.\n\n&gt;Other more minor points are society's predilection to place a motivation of competitiveness in men, as opposed to women. Men are perceived as better leaders, and are often placed in positions of power and/or leadership, which are more stressful and difficult to handle than lower positions (i.e. it is easier to be a homemaker than to have a job [and men have shown to work more stressful jobs than women], the president of an organization, albeit more powerful, has more to worry about than a member of the organization that holds no power). Men are expected to be the providers for a family, while their wives are not.\nThe expectations for men, similarly, are much higher, and men must compete more and do more to reach the same feeling of accomplishment than do women.\nThese high expectations also provide other difficulties that a woman would not face should her sex be different. When it comes to college and job applications, men are at a disadvantage when companies or university's favor diversity over qualifications. The expectation that men are more competent than women in the workplace leaves men with tasked with greater and more stressful responsibilities in the workplace, while women are given less stressful jobs. This also leads to men helping or doing tasks that are tasked to women, because of the stereotype that a man helping would improve the efficiency of the task done, creating a dependence of female co-workers on men.\nMen have a stereotype of being more powerful and violent, which leads to longer sentences and higher conviction rates in court, and for female opponents to be favored.\n\nSee benevolent sexism, then read this whole bit. Just read it. This is your own damn fault. No one is forcing you into these gendered roles but yourself. You claim all these problems exist for you but the root cause of them is your own mindset and forcing a dichotomy of gender and then trying to argue how you are actually somehow the victim here. The root of all your problems is men walking around thinking women are gentle delicate flowers that must be protected by the big strong breadwinner head of the household, and that they should be subservient and docile, also a root cause of sexual violence. \n\nThis is what some people call self-fulfilling prophecy, except the victims are women and not yourself."}, {"id": "cmi6a5e", "body": "&gt; Women make $0.77 for every dollar a man earns.

Increasing wages increases cost of production, which would first shift their production (supply) curve to the left, increasing price, lowering units bought, and depending on consumer elasticity of demand for the product, could increase or decrease their revenue. Elasticity of demand, if you don't know, is (% change in quantity/% chance in price). Unit elasticity, or perfect elasticity, is where it equals 1 and if the price changes 10% then units bought will decrease 10%. However, if it's elastic, meaning it's &gt;1, so if the price increases 10%, quantity bought would decrease greater than 10%. Most firms produce to the point of unit elasticity, which is where their total revenue is maximized. Shifting the supply curve moves the equilibrium point off of the point of unit elasticity, meaning their total revenue decreases.  However, yes, it would also shift the demand curve to the right, meaning it would eventually lead to higher total revenue, but firms historically aren't good at looking past one step, especially when they have alternative ways to spend the money they'd pay out (reinvestment) to increase revenue without affecting the consumer market. \n\nIf you don't understand that bit, it's irrelevant to my point, don't worry about it, I just want to explain the economic impact of wage increases. I don't think you understood my point. I wasn't talking about the economic impact, sorry for confusing you. My point was the structural one. Structurally, there are two results. Scenario 1: So many women get hired that either the workforce is 100% women or men get paid the same as women because there are so few working. No more wage gap. Scenario 2: Women make up the large majority of the work force, meaning their LOWER salary is now the baseline for comparison, but if men are still paid more, employers, now instead of hiring women at a discount (less than the baseline that men make), they have to hire men at a premium (higher than the baseline women make).

Most of these books were written well before then.\n\nHere's how the publishing industry works: A craze hits and publishing houses start looking for books that fit the craze. The publishing houses then buy the rights to these books and start the publishing process.\n\nOn average, it takes 9 to 12 months for a book to be published, so anything that comes out within a year or even two years of a craze hitting is almost certainly not inspired by the craze (at least as far as story goes), it just took that long to get published. That's why you start seeing a massive influx of trend-following books about a year after a craze starts.\n\nThe books that were actually inspired by the craze may never get published because most of them wont be finished until the craze is over. That's why it's a really bad idea to write to a craze. 9/10 times that a sure-fire way to ensure that you don't get published.\n\nNow that I've gotten that mini-lecture out of the way... judging the vast cannon of modern literature based off of whatever YA novel is the most popular is one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard. The most popular books are often times not the best books. Being the most popular book is just a matter of luck, knowing the right people, and marketing. Just look at 50 Shades of Grey! That awful piece of slime sold millions of copies in spite of the fact that it's poorly written, full of misinformation, and just an all-around a blight on modern literature. It didn't get popular because it's good, it got popular because the twilight fanfiction community all got behind the author and helped her make the best seller list. \n\nIf you judge modern books off of the books that have survived the decades then you're almost always going to find modern stuff lacking because, here's the thing, *bad books don't survive the test of time.* Do you think that every novel published in 1859 was as good as *A Tale of Two Cities?* Every generation has had bad novels get popular and that's a trend that will continue on to eternity.\n"}, {"id": "2nxtst", "body": "Hello guys,\n\nAvid reader here.
