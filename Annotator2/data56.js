If you look at the true history of the song, the song was written to creep house guest into leaving:\n\n\"Loesser wrote the duet in 1944 and premiered the song with his wife, Lynn Garland, at their Navarro Hotel housewarming party, and performed it toward the end of the evening, signifying to guests that it was nearly time to end the party. Garland considered it \"their song\" and was furious when Loesser sold the song to MGM.[2]\"\n\n\nImagin you have house guest at a formal event that dont get that the parties over. You creep them out with a song that suggest that the husband and wife want to get frisky tonight. The orginal singers of the song were married for years and were teasing eachother.

I took 3 years off before going back to college, and it was one of my best decisions. Here's why you should do this as opposed to just going to a far away college:\n\n1) If you want to do extensive traveling, there's no better time than now. In college you'll be too busy with school, meeting new friends, securing internships, and working for extra money to be able to travel much. After graduating you'll have even less free time-- you'll need to find a job, find your own place and whatnot, and start working your way up in your career. You'll have a couple weeks off a year, at most.  Unless you get a job that allows/uses traveling, don't expect to do any serious traveling until retirement age. Now is the best time.\n\n2) Some people fear that if kids don't go immediately go to college, that they'll never go. Such non-sense. That might have been true back in better economic times when you could find a reasonably paying job with no schooling or skills, and cost of living wasn't too expensive, but those days are gone. In this world, you pretty much need either a college education or some type of skills (which requires training).\n\n3) If you don't want to be in school, you likely won't do as well. I've seen tons of kids go straight to college who didn't really want to be there, and they all got horrible grades. Most of them dropped out. Whereas those of us who waited a couple years actually got to have the experience why college is necessary, and we came back *wanting* to be there. As such, we all did much better than we ever did in college and enjoyed being there.  College is so much more worthwhile when you're there because you want to be there.

I also wanted to be independent of my family for a while due to some drama following my parents divorce.

Sure you can transfer, but that is added work and classes may not transfer over. It will also be hard to get support from your family if you need it.  Personally I would recommend either doing a study abroad program or service program if you want an \"Adventure\". Commitment is much less. \n\nThat being said if you have a school in mind that you have visited, love, and fits your needs academically than I would go to that school.

On top of that there are many social issues which many women go through (sexual harassment in the workplace, street harassment, date rape, etc.) that are so biased towards women, and the male victims are quite low, so they are treated as gender issues.  \nI don't find this harmful because I don't see new legislation that is unequal towards men.  There are some laws that say rape is man-on-woman only but that's because they are old, not a result of feminist movements.  \nIf we saw legislation and behavior that was actually going the other way and being harmful towards males in a real way (disregarding tantrums) I would agree it's wrong.  \n\nAbout pregnancy, we all need pregnancy to happen, and biologically it's still only females that get pregnant.  So if we gave women paid time off for pregnancy and the obligation to keep her position at work, it might seem unfair comparing a nonpregnant female to a nonpregnant male, but females will always have the pressure of a burden and role males won't have.  I agree that ANY compensation made in this direction will be controversial, because achieve total balance in an unbalanced situation is impossible until technology allows males to get pregnant.

On top of that there are many social issues which many women go through (sexual harassment in the workplace, street harassment, date rape, etc.) that are so biased towards women, and the male victims are quite low, so they are treated as gender issues.  \nI don't find this harmful because I don't see new legislation that is unequal towards men.  There are some laws that say rape is man-on-woman only but that's because they are old, not a result of feminist movements.  \nIf we saw legislation and behavior that was actually going the other way and being harmful towards males in a real way (disregarding tantrums) I would agree it's wrong.  \n\nAbout pregnancy, we all need pregnancy to happen, and biologically it's still only females that get pregnant.  So if we gave women paid time off for pregnancy and the obligation to keep her position at work, it might seem unfair comparing a nonpregnant female to a nonpregnant male, but females will always have the pressure of a burden and role males won't have.  I agree that ANY compensation made in this direction will be controversial, because achieve total balance in an unbalanced situation is impossible until technology allows males to get pregnant.

That's how racism and prejudice forms. I'm reminded of modern feminism, I see reactions from people I know that they're getting annoyed about all the negative press they create.

First regarding the need for all of these labels. A lot of other commenters are providing great analogies for descriptive labels and I'm going to let them handle that part. I simply argue that it is impossible for an outsider to see if more detailed labels are necessary or not. In the case of sexuality and/or gender the only people who can say how well of a fit a label is are the ones who apply it to themselves. They also happen to be the ones who notice whether or not it is useful in discourse, how easy it is to understand, and how readily accepted it is. So since the people who are using a label also have the most data on the pros and cons of it, it is wisest to trust in their decisions regarding the need for that particular term.\n\nNow onto people who get angry when you use the wrong terms and/or pronouns. I'm guessing that you are conflating two (not mutually exclusive) groups, the people who are saddened and exasperated at people refusing to admit their authority when it comes to their own, personal identity, and then the people who blow up at people over misunderstandings. GSM (gender and sexual minorities) face a lot of willfully obtuse and needlessly cruel people. When people who are facing prejudice get angry anyone who feels unfairly targeted should practice empathy. Every now and then people will overreact to wrongdoings (this is true for all of life) and it is usually better to back off and fix the mistake instead of trying to argue what a reasonable reaction would be. Then there are the people who just blow up over misunderstandings, I have the fortune of only having met people with lots of patience regarding their labels, but I'm sure there exists assholes too. There are assholes within any group of people, GSM are no different. Do you think that over-labeling is specifically causing people to be jerks? I'd suggest Occam's Razor here, the explanation that some people are assholes is simpler than the one where over-use of labels cause people to be assholes."}, {"id": "2o0tkn", "body": "I can understand gay, lesbian, queer, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and aromantic.

It wasn't until the 19th century that the first of these terms, \"heterosexual\", first became popular to describe sexual deviants who had sex primarily for recreation and not for procreation (oh my!).\n\nIn ancient Greece you weren't gay if you were attracted to a member of the same sex and you weren't straight if you were attracted to a member of the opposite sex. Rather attraction was attributed to that particular individual *being* attractive,  it simply wasn't engendered the way it is now.\n\nSo the ultimate goal of the queer movement should theoretically be to deconstruct all categories to the point that it simply doesn't matter anymore.  In order to do this, however, they need to create categories and include those categories in order to be able to foment solidarity.  You can't really fight against systemic discrimination if you do not identify yourself.   \n\nSo you can look at the ever increasing amount of categories as the traditional roles continuing to be splintered into tiny and tiny and more and more specific bits like a mosaic.  The end goal/result of which is the destruction of the categories themselves.  \n\nIf you think some of this is too complicated or absurd, that is because on some level it is supposed to be, it is because queer theory reveals the fact the attitudes that seek to define and restrict gender and sexuality are fundamentally paradoxical and can *never* properly capture reality.\n\n"}, {"id": "2o0tkn", "body": "I can understand gay, lesbian, queer, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and aromantic.

In and of itself this (your) notion appears quite profound, but it refers to what is in fact a quite ubiquitous phenomenon, as noted in the previous, excellent, posts in this thread. Building from its fact - that fear is seldom, if ever, a rational choice - it stands to reason that the sort of rationality that you imply is at work in the individual effort to \"*demonstrate* that one has no problems in one's life\" would be incompatible with the irrational - or rather, *pre*rational response to this or that perceived threat. It is not as if, in choosing to buy Gas Mask A over Gas Mask B, we are making a point to convey our status, be it social or economic; such concerns are secondary, if not totally irrelevant, in relation to the greater concern i.e. protecting ourselves against the (ostensible) threat of a bio-terror attack, or whatever. Regardless of whether or not a \"climate of fear\" exists or whether the same has been in some way fabricated by whomever, the product is always the same: fear.\n\nAt any rate, I've probably just gone and overstated what has already been stated. Still, I do think that you are getting at something quite interesting, namely, how we in our actions are perhaps ultimately **subject to**, and not the authors of, our social status. In effect, we can only talk about the demonstration of status insofar as one is able to *do* something with said status, such as making an impression on other people. But it is not as if status is something that is only demonstrated through deliberate action; rather, status enjoys an agency of its own quite outside of the individual who 'possesses' it. When I talk to you about the various measures I've taken in order to prepare for a looming superstorm or what have you, it may well be that I am trying to hint at my being relatively better prepared than you and therefore better than you as such. However, it could just as easily be the case that I am simply stating what precautions I have adopted out of raw necessity. In either case, perception of 'status' lies just as much in the eye of the beholder as it does in the 'privilege' to which I *ostensibly* lay claim.\n\nEDIT1: Capital, not capitol.

But I would challenge that people having sex outside of a loving relationship necessarily involves using someone as a means.\n\nLet's get away from sex for a bit.  Say I want to play some Magic: the Gathering, as it's a pastime I enjoy.  I seek out my friend, who also enjoys MtG and is at an equal skill level, and ask him if he would like to play for a bit.  He says yes, we play some games and both have a great time.  Now, was I selfishly using him to fulfill my desire to have an opponent for a game of Magic?  I would say no.  I made my decision based on his mutual love for the game, I believed he also would enjoy it, and sought and respected his decision to join me.  Now, if he didn't want to and I badgered him until he relented, that would be different, and that would be using him as a means.\n\nI would argue that sex is not so different.  If you both wish to engage in a mutually enjoyable activity, and you are respecting the free will and desires of the other party, you are not using them as a means.  Just because you are not in a loving relationship does not mean you can't respect the person and treat them as an end.

I find quite the opposite: If I'm in a trusting relationship, I might have misplaced my trust, but I'm also more likely to discard of conventional sexual safety practices, if the relationship goes on long enough. Having sex casually always demands condoms be used, but if you're in a relationship eventually condoms go away.\n\n2. There's nothing wrong with using someone as a sex object *only in this scenario* where both people are equally using each other for sex, and both parties are aware of that.\n\n3. It can happen, but if you're prepared for it you can mitigate by just thinking about what you say during the afterglow.\n\nLet me now enumerate some reasons that casual sex is strictly better than a relationship:\n\n1. I don't have to care about their personality to nearly the same degree. To have a trusting relationship, there are a lot of hurdles, and I have pretty high standards for my partner's personality and intelligence. Casual sex allows me to completely ignore parts of a person's personality that would be annoying in a long-term relationship while getting that same release.\n\n2. There's less chance of getting hurt by a breakup. You know things are not serious, and you don't get hung up on the petty things that can fuck with you during a relationship; jealousy, clingyness, all that stuff that happens in a relationship, which then tend to cause breakups. The worst I've ever said about a one-night stand is that it was unfulfilling, not that she broke my heart into a thousand pieces and I was a wreck for months afterwards.\n\n3. Options. For many people, the idea of sleeping with just one person is boring, and open relationships are difficult."}, {"id": "2o0ifx", "body": "I'm aware the following are opinions, but I will be stating them as facts to make things easier. Sex is a very powerful action that doesn't necessarily have to be used for conception every time, but should only be used between two very close people. The two people should be together for long enough to know eachother very well and have a very healthy, trusting relationship. One night stands and other \"no strings attached\" relationships are dangerous and can be unhealthy for both participants' mental state. Having sex just based on urges is uncivilized and is unhealthy for society as a whole. \nChange my view. Thanks.\n\nEdit: I suppose I figured out what \"bothers\" me so much about casual sex.

"}, {"id": "cmimx5x", "body": "The first that really struck me is that long term monogamous relationships, when they end, have been far more psychologically damaging than any casual encounter where myself and another person consented to have fun without the emotional attachment involved. \n\nIs it fair to say those who end up hurt by casual encounters are often the type of people with greater difficulty separating sex and love? They can be synonymous, you suggest they should be, but from my understanding they are most certainly not. \n\nYou claim that sex based on the urge is unhealthy, but is it not also unhealthy to confuse sex for love? That might be a bit reaching, but that's the sense I got from your CMV. That sex and love are synonymous and you must have love to have sex.\n\nAnother part of separating sex from love, or having casual sex is that is helps someone be much better to differentiate between lust or love. You could spend 3 months, 6 months, maybe longer getting to know them before you have sex to be sure you're in love. But, if you hop around in the hay and it fizzles out pretty quickly afterwards(a month or two) you just saved yourself a bunch of time you might have wasted on someone you really didn't like as much as you thought you did, or could have. \n\nCasual sex is also a great way to live out fantasy you wouldn't be comfortable with a serious partner. Some things people just need to get out of their system. Fantasy often is about yourself and your desire, not your partner. It's not always something people want to share. If a man has a diaper fetish, that might be better left to a professional dominatrix he doesn't have to see everyday. \n\nSexuality is such an interesting and expansive part of ourselves. To deny it and its potential for personal growth would be a shame and unfair to ourselves as human. \n\n "}, {"id": "2o0ifx", "body": "I'm aware the following are opinions, but I will be stating them as facts to make things easier.

Go onto any relationship or sex subreddit.  You'll see stories about how someone's one night stand went super well and they just learned this neat trick they want to share with everyone.  You'll also see (way more) stores about sex in relationships that's either physically or emotionally (or both) unfulfilling.  While I would agree that the quality of the sex is probably greater on average in relationships than one night stands, because the person knows you and what you like better, there are many many exceptions to the rule.  \n\nAlso, something being instinctual has no bearing on it's morality or whether or not it's psychologically damaging.  People use the reverse of your argument all the time, and it's not correct then either.  Evolution doesn't care about morality.  Behaviors that harm other individuals will be selected for in circumstances where competition is high, behaviors that are beneficial to other individuals will be selected for when cooperation is beneficial.  There are some things we instinctively do that are considered morally superior, and other things that land people (rightfully) in jail.  Chimps sometimes kill each other, but other times they adopt abandoned juveniles.  Both of those things are instinctive, they're both things we also do, but are on complete opposite ends of the \"morality\" spectrum.  You should never judge something's ethical value on the basis of whether or not it's \"instinctive\" or animalistic.  Bonobos (aka pygmy chimpanzees) have sex (almost) at random with whatever individual is closest whenever possible, but they almost never kill each other.

Except that it isn't. \n\nIn my research I have not found a single place that sells eggs for profits which ethically sources birds (no chick culling) and allows the females to live out their lives with medical care. I have met some people who have rescued hens and treat them well -- many who don't eat the eggs, a few who do. It's obviously most ethical to give the hen her eggs -- but if you were to eat the eggs, you have still done a good thing.  I promise -- call any \"humane\" farm and ask those questions and the answers will be depressing. Even the rare ones where the hens get to dig in the dirt and hunt bugs and sunshine. \n\nAs for dairy, the dealing with the extra males is a big issue. If you have a cow and want milk, you will have 2  cows in a year. The only attempt at slaughter free dairy I've seen are the [Hare Krishna](http://www.ahimsamilk.org/faq/), who sell very expensive milk, don't make a profit and who can't sell to everyone who wants -- they hope to produce 1000 liters of milk a week - at a UK average milk consumption of 1.5 liters, that's not even enough to feed all the UK Hare Krishna. Or all the Hare Krishna in their delivery radius.\n\nSo at the very least, if you are defending milk and eggs based on these theoretical technicalities - it's only fair to clarify that in practice they are cruel, you only would support them in theory if you could find this, but you can't. Don't pretend that the cruelty is easily avoidable by going to the farmers market instead of the grocery store, because it is not."}, {"id": "cmish3u", "body": "Everything you have written here is an indictment on factory farming, not dairy.

At best they pay someone else to kill them when they purchase only female chicks from a hatchery.\n\nMuch of the reason hens are killed young is not just that they lay fewer eggs, but that they start to fall apart from the rate of eggs they have been bred to lay. Hundreds per year, their wild  counterparts who lay about 12 yearly are not farmed on even  the nicest farms. It isn't cost effective to give them medical care that they need.\n\nSorry, absolutely nothing I mentioned is pertaining strictly to factory farms. Sure, the intensive confinement and debeaking and dehorning are even worse, but that doesn't make what we do on \"humane\" farms remotely acceptable by any reasonable standard.\n"}, {"id": "cmjikli", "body": "Cows don't give milk unless they have a calf, small farms usually inseminate too - much safer and easier than keeping the bull.

I would support that, even if you ate the eggs. There are many hens who need rescuing, most with expensive medical needs. This is because of the system that kills the roosters as babies - there would be no hens to rescue if we didn't exploit them so badly - but taking in those girls is still a great thing. Of course, know that sanctuaries usually feed the eggs back to the hens who enjoy eating them. People I know who have hens and are looking to do the absolute best thing for them put them on birth control to avoid infections from broken eggs, or backed up eggs which can be painful and deadly. \n\nIf you buy hens from a hatchery you are paying for a service. What service is that? Breeding egg hens. Which results in half male birds. So the service includes disposing of the extra males. You could, of course get males too -- but in paying for the females you are paying for the male disposal service. The males will probably be free. Of course, taking in the males who are destined to die as babies is an excellent thing to do -- but does it cancel out the fact that you are handing money over to an industry who breeds animals and treats them as disposable? I don't really think so. It would probably be similar to [buying dogs from a puppy mill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_mill) and maybe taking in some of the dogs they were throwing out as an extra. Neither hatcheries or puppy mills are industries you can support and pretend to care about animals.\n\nAlso, the roosters you raise present their own problems. The reason that even the \"humane\" farms have few or no roosters is because if the roosters are kept with the chickens they will fight with each other. So you either need to keep the roosters at a chicken free location or keep only one. I am not saying farmers want to do evil -- I am saying that when the product you sell comes from the body of the animal, there are real logistical issues which mean you need to choose between acting in a way which is just to that animal or treating that animal as a thing to be used for food. If this is your livelihood - no matter how high the prices, the animal is a thing to be used and there is abuse."}, {"id": "cmijd55", "body": "I agree with you in the case of beef, but all meat is not created equal.
