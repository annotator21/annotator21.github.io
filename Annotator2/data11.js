I was referred here by another poster and I've read through the rules and it seems like the perfect sub for a good debate :).  That being said:\n\nI don't understand why it's inappropriate to use profanity or even for children to be exposed to or even use profanity.  \"Swear words\" are literally just words, and most of them are considered slang or profanity since they originated from the Anglo-Saxon words.  I do not allow my children to swear, but every time that I tell them not to I feel like a hypocrite.  The only reasons I don't allow them to swear is because I don't want them to get into the habit, then let a swear word slip at school and end up in trouble.  Society seems to really look down on children using profanity, so I also don't want an investigation from DCF or anything like that.\n\nI understand that some people find them offensive from a religious standpoint, but as a non religious person myself, this doesn't apply to me and I don't feel like it's a good \"anti-profanity argument\" since it doesn't coincide with my morality.  My moral code is simple: does this action harm another individual in some way?  If so, analyze the action and determine if the fault lies in the action or the person being harmed by it.

I don't use them much, but I have no reservations about using them and have no issues with people using them (except for when it is excessive, but that is rare).\n\nNow here is where I see there being an issue with swear words: even though it does not offend you, someone in your audience (and this just means someone to whom you are talking or in your direct vicinity) might take offense. That person might take offense. I know you place the\n\n    \"just because you're offended doesn't make you right.\"\n\nWhich is true. But keep in mind that even though your morality states that profanity is fine, that will not matter much, if at all, to a religious person whose morality dictates that profanity is unacceptable.\n\nAs you said, you try to prevent your children from swearing. I do not see you as a hypocrite because you have a great reason for it: they might get into the habit.\n\n    My moral code is simple: does this action harm another individual in some way? If so, analyze the action and determine if the fault lies in the action or the person being harmed by it.\n\nIt is a pretty good moral code, but it ignores the fact that some have less control over their morality. At the risk of generalizing, it is more common for a religious person's morality to be guided by more than just oneself and the social situation. They have a more religiously-oriented moral code. What you interpret as their fault (\"they are too sensitive\"), they could interpret as your fault (\"he is trying to offend me\").\n\nUltimately, profanity is perfectly fine, I am not arguing that. I AM saying that since children do not yet have the full cognitive understanding that there are words that are inappropriate to say to certain people and/or during certain situations. Once they learn when it is unacceptable (so that if they go to their friend's cousin's Bar Mitzvah or the such, they should not use profanity while at the Synagogue), then it no longer is an issue.\n\nLet's consider for a moment other words. Not words that are profane but ones which are inappropriate during a given situation. If, FSM forbid, one of your children is kidnapped and killed, it would be EXTREMELY inappropriate for someone to tell you that \"God has a plan for everyone and your kid is now in a better place.\" This also returns to the subjective portion of the morality I mentioned earlier. The religious person's morality might dictate to say that, but yours would not. If it happened to a religious friend/co-worker, you might say \"I'm sorry for your loss. If you need to talk to someone, I'm here.\" But that would ALSO be appropriate from a religious person to a non-religious person. Hell, the whole \"God has a plan for everyone and your kid is now in a better place.\" might be inappropriate from one religious person to another.\n\nThere is power in words. Not allowing your children to swear as a teachable moment is fine (since in this case the teachable moment is \"it is not appropriate to say/do this in some cases.\" \n"}, {"id": "2pf19b", "body": "Firstly let me say that this is my first post in this sub, and I'm hoping that it's the correct place.

But you live in a *society* where the effect if the language you use must be taken into account. \n\nAll words have connotations.   Even if you personally don't have any emotional reaction to profanity, most people do.   The reaction tends to be a negative one.   They don't want to hear it.  Profanity is referred to as \"filth\" and \"potty mouth\" for this reason.    \n\nThere are also certain class and intellectual associations people will make with the style of language you use.  If you choose swear words when another word will do,  people may very well make some assumptions about you:  you're an attention whore trying to shock others to be noticed.   Or maybe you're inarticulate and this is your only vocabulary.   Or perhaps you come from a low socioeconomic class and weren't raised any better.    \n\nLanguage should be tailored for the audience.   You'd explain things differently to a child than your grandmother, a doctor,  or a coworker.   If you are employed in a professional work place, you're expected to communicate in a professional manner.    That means treating others with respect,  not using ugly words, and projecting a classy successfully image.    Do you truly believe a professional would tell his boss or client to \"fuck off. I'm busy\". Wouldn't it show more respect if you said \"I'm finishing up this call. Do you mind waiting a moment?\"\n\nSo, if you want people to assume you're inarticulate riff raff, by all means keep using all the profanity you want.

I know Lat Week Tonight is satirical, but it still makes the point. \n\nIf a cop stops me and tries to create a civil forfeiture case with me, I can either let him and then never see my stuff again and it would be legal. OR I could resist and then by your definition I will have done something wrong. A cop doing something that is wrong cannot be made into him (or her, I just use him out of convenience) doing something right. \n\nWhat would I do if a cop told me to get down on the ground? Well, I might get down. But whether or not I do, I will ask the officer WHY. Now if it is for my safety I will have no issue. But then if it turns out to be a random search, well, I will have a huge problem with it. I definitely won't physically attack the officer but I will more than likely verbally argue (with my usual animated hands as I talk, but those movements are far from what one would call aggressive). And if it is indeed the latter, I will have been in the wrong in the eyes of the law. At the risk of sounding paranoid, it is less likely the officer will use deadly force on me (I have a \"spends quite a bit of time at the beach\" skin complexion and a general body structure of a guy that spends a lot of time indoors). I mention paranoia because given some of the recent cases, I might not have been given the same \"privilege.\" Your scenario, especially if it turns out as a case of unreasonable searches, is abuse of power.

Influenza is not a single virus, but rather a family of viruses (remember H1N1). Since it is a family of viruses instead of just 1, you cannot vaccinate for all flu viruses that might pop up in a given area, it just isn't feasible to vaccinate against that many viruses. So, every year the CDC uses some smart people stuff to figure out the 6-8 strains of influenza that are *most likely to affect the most people*. The vaccine that you get every season is a vaccine against these 6-8 strains that the CDC picked out. This is also why you need a new vaccine every season, the strains that are suspected to be more prevalent will change from year to year. Contrast that to something like Chicken Pox which is a relatively stable virus so you only need the one vaccine and a booster a few years later.\n\nNow, the reason that it isn't super successful is 2-fold. \n\n* The flu vaccine is comprised of dead viruses to give your immune system a kick start on killing them should it encounter them. In most people this does not induce any symptoms other than perhaps a fever, if that. But some people's immune systems overreact to the dead viruses and produce real symptoms. This isn't, however, a real case of the flu, but a lot of people freak out and claim that the vaccine makes them sick and so they say the vaccine doesn't work.\n\n* The vaccine, like I mentioned above, only protects against a few strains of the virus family. It does little to no good if you encounter a strain that it did not protect you against, of which there are dozens or hundreds. So, of course the success rate will not be 100% (disregarding the aforementioned people of course).\n\nAlso, I would normally tend to agree with you on the basis of it being a money grab. However, the flu vaccine is routinely given out for free to pretty much everyone. If you are paying for it then you are a dumbass. You just have to walk a few blocks in any medium to large sized city to find a free clinic during flu season. So making money is not a factor for the flu vaccine.\n\nAnd this is all coming from someone who legitimately hates modern medicine. I believe it works yes, but I prefer to stay away from it and just wait out any illnes I get unless I am absolutely, terribly miserable.

Shouldn't the same logic extend here. Not all men commit sexual violence towards women, so using those few to define a whole gender is incorrect.\n\nSomeone please make a case as to why Feminism is inclusive to men. Explain to me why a man should respect or join the feminist movement. I feel like we can all advocate for equality without having to blame a certain group or overgeneralize a whole gender. \n\nAnd to avoid hypocricy... not all feminists do this. They really don't. I have met some great women and men that identified as a feminist. But it is hard to discount that this group has gotten out of hand.

Non-feminists are men and women. This isn't a men *versus* feminists/women thing like you've set it up to be. \n\nThe \"not all men\" criticism isn't criticizing the *fact* that not all men are violent or rapists. Feminists know that fact. Rather, criticizing people who butt in and say \"not all men\" is criticizing *those people for butting in and changing the topic of discussion.* If a woman is talking about how she was assaulted, or a news outlet is reporting on assault statistics, saying \"not all men assault\" is as meaningless and obvious as saying \"they sky is blue.\" We *know* not all men assault. But right now we're talking about those that do, or we're talking about a person who was assaulted. In general, nobody is accusing *all* men, so saying \"not *all* men\" is unnecessary and derailing. \n\n&gt;Someone please make a case as to why Feminism is inclusive to men.\n\nAgain, you're asking for feminism 101 here. Feminism is inclusive to men because it's inclusive to *anyone* who believes women should have equal rights and opportunities as men, and men and women shouldn't be pigeonholed into gender stereotypical boxed based on their gender.

The reason some feminist media says, \"Stop telling women how to dress and start teaching men not to rape!\" isn't because they believe all men are rapists, but because it often feels like society puts the onus on women to not get raped. \n\nI can understand why saying this can make men feel victimized. Most men probably aren't aware of what women feel that they're being told by society with regards to rape prevention, so it probably seems like it comes out of left field. I think that's one of the biggest problems when we discuss any kind of oppression, be it sexism, racism, classism, etc. It's really hard to imagine what the other side experiences if we never see or experience it ourselves -- and we so often don't! I don't experience racism and I generally don't see it because I'm white and live in a mostly white town -- I have to trust my non-white friends when they tell me about their experiences. I'm not a man, so I don't experience people telling me to \"man up\" or giving me shit when I am publicly emotional. I have to trust my boyfriend when he tells me it happens.

NEVER walk in the dark alone.. duh! \n\nSo without realizing it they've just listed everything *you* did wrong that night. How if you hadn't worn that skirt, or hadn't walked alone in the dark that would not have happened. Heck, if you hadn't led that guy on and left him with blue balls you wouldn't have even drawn his attention. \n\nWhenever you think back onto that night, you think of how everything went wrong. You replay and replay the whole night in your mind and think of everything you could have done differently. Why did I have to go out that night?

The guy is always supposed to take the opening and push for one step further (the next kiss, the hand on the hip, the hand moving south) and takes no resistance as the ok to continue further. Then if they are successful and the girl sleeps with the guy on the first night that girl is probably a slut and sleeps with tons of guys so she's not actually datable, just a hook up. \n\nThere's lots of these cultural nuances that slowly result in situations like the story above. He drunkenly believed she led him on and he is mad. He made advances and she responded, therefore he was expecting to be able to continue to advance. When he was suddenly shut down he was angry. He could have spent all night flirting and buying expensive fruity drinks for another girl at that bar. Now he's supposed to go home alone? \n\nThis is what feminism in my opinion is fighting here in the U.S. When we say that we are fighting the patriarchal system, it's these unfair expectations placed on both men and women.

Are you sure those are the *only* two options?\n\nWhat about that the statistics we are using on could possibly be unreliable? \n\nTake for example the established fact that female-on-male rape is not even accepted as rape under many jurisdictions.\n\nA big problem with addressing the problem of male rape is the manner in which we classify the act of rape.\n\nAccording to the most recent classification of the FBI, Rape is:\n\n\u201cThe penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\u201d\n\n[source](http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/attorney-general-eric-holder-announces-revisions-to-the-uniform-crime-reports-definition-of-rape)\n\nNotice a problem there? Notice how the most common form of female-on-male rape (where he is forced to penetrate her) isn't included in this classification? \n\nIt gets even more fucked up. Check out this lovely [CDC document](http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf) on the topic. \n\nBefore I dive right in to my main argument, I'm going to take a little detour and see what the CDC considers rape.\n \"Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Rape is separated into three types, completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration\" pg 18\n\nOnce again only classifying forced penetration as \"real rape\". \n\nAnyways, let's take a look at tables 2.1 and 2.2. Firstly, notice how it only considers 'forced penetration' rape, and puts 'made to penetrate' under \"other sexual violence\".\n\nNow take a look at the \"12 month\" segment of the graph. (I am using the 12 month statistic because it is a more reliable way to determine the current trends than using the \"lifetime\" segment.)\n\nIt indicates that over a 12 month period, **1.1% of women experienced 'forced penetration'**, while **1.1% of men were 'forced to penetrate'**.\n\nOn page 24 it states that of the men who were 'forced to penetrate' 79% of them reported a female perpetrator. Women who were the victims of 'forced penetration' identified a male perpetrator 98% of the time. \n\nBy using these statistics, it indicates that of heterosexual rape, women are the perpetrators 40.3% of the time. Unfortunately it does not also give the 12 month numbers for 'forced penetration' for men. So it would be in error to simply state that 40% of rapists are women, however it does seem to indicate that it is a lot larger than the 6% that you asserted earlier.\n\nCurrent trends suggest that female-on-male rape does seem to happen at a similar rate to male-on-female, however the issue is that female-on-male rape is not recorded as rape due to a faulty definition of rape as used by the CDC and the FBI etc.\n\n\nMaybe a good idea would be to stop viewing rape as a 'woman issue' and rather as a 'human issue'."}, {"id": "cmvwqg6", "body": "I think there is a difference between looking up feminism on wikipedia and reading what they say they stand for and critisizing what the movment seems to be doing in the media. \n\nAgain, on paper the movement is about gender equality, and yes that is great and I am all for it but when you have ads like this one:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqHYzYn3WZw\n\nIt really makes you question the movement.

Saying patriarchy here is basically an unfalsifiable construct that blankets truths and non-truths.  This is where all ideology falls wayside to its intended purpose.  Men holding power positions and male privilege are certainly tangible to some degree, so i'm not here to argue that point because I agree.  But this false dichotomy of oppresor/oppressed is a very deep, very nuanced issue that many modern social activists do not take fully into account.  One example of this is the issue of dependency.  Humans are naturally dependent on others.  And a natural bi-product of this, whether good or bad, is that dependency creates power structures.  Why people are dependent on certain individuals has many factors involved.  It could be for financial,emotional, or spiritual support for one.   This is why we have managers and priests.  It can be for a lack of skill or expertise.  This is the nature of capitalism and economy itself.\nThe question then becomes, what are the intricacies of independence among males and females and where do the lines of biology and environmental causality stand.  Patriarchy ignores all of the deeper nuances but instead links all problems to a common cause, much like Christianity uses \"sin\" to denote any non-moral behavior.  We as responsible citizens, need to tread this kind of ideological ground very carefully less we fall prey to blind ideology and moral policing.  \nYou mentioned that man can be more emotional if they are liberated by feminism, but how do know that is for the better.  This sounds nice but it completely ignores all of the dynamics of natural human behavior and instinct plus regular power dynamics and dependency chains that I touched on before.  If we want improvement, we need to know what we can improve and how it can be implemented.  Not just blind faith in liberation ideologies.
