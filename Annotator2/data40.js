They then introduce scenarios and characters and watch events unfold in a way that would be fairly congruent to if it were happening here.\n\nOthers make worlds that are more like fun-house mirrors.

Not to say that's a bad thing (I was way more dramatic then I am now; it's sorta natural), but I feel that he did a good job remembering his audience and creating a world that would deliver a major truth home to them with the characters maintaining this truth in an internally consistent manner.\n\nIt's alright if you don't like it.

Having seen him perform before his fame, it's pretty obvious his motivation is decreasing world suck.\n\nHe helped cancer patients for a while and eventually wrote TFIOS book to discuss some very troubling topics he likely encountered. I don't read much, but I decided to read TFIOS after the movie was announced because my english-major GF is a huge admirer (HUUUGE) and I knew John would have something neat to say in his book.\n\nThis is one of two books about death that rattled me, and while the writing styles are vastly different, the two seem to have similarities. Pet Sematary, the first book to focus my attention on death, played on several tropes in the horror genre. King did a much better job of covering them up than John, but even in 9th grade, it felt like a standard spooky story. Except, the story was a wrapper. Inside the story were layers of deep, philosophical examinations of existence and death. The movie was disappointing because those messages- the whole reason I found this book so compulsory-were minimized or stripped.\n\nTFIOS is similar, but the emphasis is different. PS had an intriguing story line. TFIOS doesn't. The girl has the most ridiculous shit happen to her repeatedly for no reason. It's the most fantastical story I've ever read, with even more Mary Sueness than Twilight. The wrapper over John's thoughts is extremely thin, which is probably why it comes off as pretentious. Under the wrapper, though, is the most detailed, expansive discussion of death I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. PS gave some insights to dealing with loss, but TFIOS had nonstop chatter about loss, dying, living, and the purpose of all of them.  All wrapped in this thinly veiled Tween genre so that people in high school would hold interest in the conversation.\n\nBoth books are wonderful attempts at tackling large topics, but TFIOS wins the philosophical questioning award because, in all honesty, there wasn't much else in the book. Notice that this is probably why the movie turned out so terrible despite being the most accurate transition from book to movie. Theres really no point in seeing the story if you aren't digging into the message behind it."}, {"id": "2okad4", "body": "Before you tell me I'm an uncultured swine and to stop judging books I haven't read (sorry, John - I know how you hate split infinitives), I have read nearly all of his works: The Fault in Our Stars, Looking for Alaska, An Abundance of Katherines, Paper Towns, Will Grayson, Will Grayson, Let it Snow (his collection of short stories with Maureen Johnson)...\n\nI am a teenage girl who is a huge fan of Young Adult literature.

At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He\u2019s not particularly successful as an engineer, but I\u2019ve met lots of other engineers who aren\u2019t as good as me at physics, so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not just a result of him being bad at it.\n\n\nI\u2019m also pretty good at engineering. I don\u2019t have a degree, and other than physics I don\u2019t have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\n\n\nI have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I\u2019ve come across. Every question of existentialism which I\u2019ve seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven\u2019t been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I\u2019ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.\nPsychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there\u2019s no aspect of psychology which I don\u2019t have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud\u2019s theories.\n\n\nI\u2019m a good enough writer that I\u2019m writing a book and so far everybody who\u2019s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that\u2019s not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I\u2019ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if that will suffice as evidence that I\u2019m intelligent. I\u2019m done with it, though, because I\u2019d rather defend my maturity, since it\u2019s what you\u2019ve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\n\nI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn\u2019t just faking it, I\u2019d even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self\u2019s actions, it shouldn\u2019t be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren\u2019t harming others. I don\u2019t have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don\u2019t care what a person\u2019s fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don\u2019t have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that\u2019s not really an impressive moral, but it\u2019s unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\n\nI love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.\n\n\nI\u2019m pretty much a pacifist. I\u2019ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I\u2019ll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don\u2019t attack, I\u2019ll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don\u2019t fight back. I\u2019ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I\u2019m never in a situation where I\u2019ll be worse off after a fight. If I\u2019m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don\u2019t care.\n\n\nThe only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I\u2019ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I\u2019d prefer to do that over killing them.\n\n\nI consider myself a feminist. I don\u2019t believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it\u2019ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \u201cwomen are crazy\u201d circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don\u2019t think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren\u2019t awesome.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything\u2019s OK when it\u2019s really not (and that\u2019s a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).\n\n\nI\u2019m kind of tired of citing these examples and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re getting tired of reading them, if you\u2019ve even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I\u2019m pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\nAnd, uh, I\u2019m a pretty good moderator.\nAll that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

Unlike engineering, there\u2019s no aspect of psychology which I don\u2019t have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud\u2019s theories.\n\n\nI\u2019m a good enough writer that I\u2019m writing a book and so far everybody who\u2019s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that\u2019s not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I\u2019ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if that will suffice as evidence that I\u2019m intelligent. I\u2019m done with it, though, because I\u2019d rather defend my maturity, since it\u2019s what you\u2019ve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\n\nI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn\u2019t just faking it, I\u2019d even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self\u2019s actions, it shouldn\u2019t be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren\u2019t harming others. I don\u2019t have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don\u2019t care what a person\u2019s fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don\u2019t have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that\u2019s not really an impressive moral, but it\u2019s unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\n\nI love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.\n\n\nI\u2019m pretty much a pacifist. I\u2019ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I\u2019ll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don\u2019t attack, I\u2019ll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don\u2019t fight back. I\u2019ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I\u2019m never in a situation where I\u2019ll be worse off after a fight. If I\u2019m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don\u2019t care.\n\n\nThe only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I\u2019ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I\u2019d prefer to do that over killing them.\n\n\nI consider myself a feminist. I don\u2019t believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it\u2019ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \u201cwomen are crazy\u201d circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don\u2019t think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren\u2019t awesome.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything\u2019s OK when it\u2019s really not (and that\u2019s a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).\n\n\nI\u2019m kind of tired of citing these examples and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re getting tired of reading them, if you\u2019ve even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I\u2019m pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\nAnd, uh, I\u2019m a pretty good moderator.\nAll that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

Drugs are always a cost/benefit analysis. There are side effects that have to be considered, and there are benefits to taking the medication; if the side effects are worse than the benefits, then a drug is \"bad for you\", but if the benefits are better than the side effects are bad, then the drug is \"good for you\". \n\nAntidepressants are a tool, but they aren't the only tool out there to help with depression.

Im sure she already explained, but double dysthymia basically means you have episodes of depression alongside a more mild, persistent sort of depression. It is not easy to work with from what i know.  There are plenty of different medications out there, just to say - I'd definitely ask about what other kinds might be worth trying if the initial bit doesn't work out. Abilify is used primarily as an antipsychotic, but is often used exactly the way you've described, as it works with depression too. I'm not going to go much further there because I'm not a doctor, but if you feel at all like something is going wrong or not feeling right, don't be afraid to contact that doctor and let them know - they can't help if they're not made aware. Don't be afraid to be a little assertive about trying other medications, if you need to - last thing you want is to go through some big procedure when it could have been helped with less, and it all is ultimately your choice what to do. \n\nRegular sleep, exercise, and good diet will absolutely assist in stabilizing your mood too, if you're not practicing those things already. Not doing so makes completely normal people get weird; the ill effects are only magnified when you're in this sort of situation. You'll also end up healthier for it and that's always good too. Mono sucks terribly, but if you can manage to get out and do stuff without hurting yourself, you'll feel at least a little better. Definitely look into possible ways to work with that on its own too. I sincerely wish you luck. It's tough, but you'll emerge strong as hell by the end of it. \n\nAlso, algae coach can stick to his plants if he likes, but I've never heard of that doing anything.

It can be a hard thing to imagine when you are depressed but even with severe chronic depression, there are treatments that improve quality of life in more ways than you can imagine. \n\nAs has been mentioned before, see a psychiatrist. Also, INSIST on seeing a therapist. Most psychiatrists will require it anyway, but if they don't, make sure you do. There is a psychological factor to depression whether it is the primary cause or if it is secondary to a physical problem. Whatever treatment you go through will change the way you think about things and there is no reason to struggle through those changes alone when there are professionals that can help.\n\nIn the mean time, I suggest you look up a couple things. There are many reasons that anti-depressants could cause your depression to be worse. The most common is Bipolar disorder. That requires a different type of medication to be used either on its own or in conjunction with SSRI antidepressants. \n\nSecond, you may meet the conditions for treatment resistant depression (What I have been diagnosed with). I have a bit more experience with this. **Again, its for your doctor to decide so I am only suggesting that you do some research on your own and take everything you read with a grain of salt.** The minimum conditions for treatment resistant depression are having tried between 1-4 antidepressants unsuccessfully. In my case, my brain/body chemistry does not respond well to typical SSRI and SNRI meds. I have recently had some success with MAOI treatments but those tend to carry a much more serious side effect list. I cannot eat any foods with aged proteins and certain amino acids in them (Low tyrosine diet - no cheese, nuts, lunch meat, or many other things). \n\nFinally, there is a relatively new treatment called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (**TMS**). It has not been around for very long and the long term effects are largely unknown. That said, it has been showing some amazing results, especially for depression that does not respond to other treatments. It is expensive and often not covered by insurance but, at least for me, is one of the most promising treatments and well worth the investment to feel happy again.

It can be a hard thing to imagine when you are depressed but even with severe chronic depression, there are treatments that improve quality of life in more ways than you can imagine. \n\nAs has been mentioned before, see a psychiatrist. Also, INSIST on seeing a therapist. Most psychiatrists will require it anyway, but if they don't, make sure you do. There is a psychological factor to depression whether it is the primary cause or if it is secondary to a physical problem. Whatever treatment you go through will change the way you think about things and there is no reason to struggle through those changes alone when there are professionals that can help.\n\nIn the mean time, I suggest you look up a couple things. There are many reasons that anti-depressants could cause your depression to be worse. The most common is Bipolar disorder. That requires a different type of medication to be used either on its own or in conjunction with SSRI antidepressants. \n\nSecond, you may meet the conditions for treatment resistant depression (What I have been diagnosed with). I have a bit more experience with this. **Again, its for your doctor to decide so I am only suggesting that you do some research on your own and take everything you read with a grain of salt.** The minimum conditions for treatment resistant depression are having tried between 1-4 antidepressants unsuccessfully. In my case, my brain/body chemistry does not respond well to typical SSRI and SNRI meds. I have recently had some success with MAOI treatments but those tend to carry a much more serious side effect list. I cannot eat any foods with aged proteins and certain amino acids in them (Low tyrosine diet - no cheese, nuts, lunch meat, or many other things). \n\nFinally, there is a relatively new treatment called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (**TMS**). It has not been around for very long and the long term effects are largely unknown. That said, it has been showing some amazing results, especially for depression that does not respond to other treatments. It is expensive and often not covered by insurance but, at least for me, is one of the most promising treatments and well worth the investment to feel happy again. The side effects that have been seen so far are all temporary, a major bonus over meds where they can last for as long as the chemicals are in your system. Basically, around half of people get a headache for the day after a treatment session and a smaller number of people report some pain or discomfort on the scalp where the magnet passes through, similar to a mild sunburn.

Still, there has been no evidence of negative effects and no reason to believe there will be (to the best of my knowledge). Still, there is long term hope for even the worst case of depression and that is always something to keep in mind. The medicine gets better all the time but at some point you have to look at options for now. Worsening depression is a dangerous thing. \n\n\nI believe the test your talking about is **[GeneSight Testing](http://assurexhealth.com/products/)**. I had it done myself. Mostly, it tells you how you metabolize substances rather than how they will work for you. Still it is very inexpensive (cost is dependent on income) and is a good starting point. For example, it could tell you that you don't absorb a certain SSRI well so you might need to take a slightly higher dose to have an effect. What it won't be able to tell you is whether or not that SSRI will help or what side effects you may get from it. \n\n\nI may sound a bit blunt here and in my last post but Im not going to pull any punches. This is a serious issue and you deserve to know the potential risks along with the benefits. I can tell you for a fact that I would not be alive today without anti depressants. I can also tell you that I had no idea how bad off I was until I started to feel better. No one deserves to live like that.\n\n\nI understand the fear and misgivings. It took me 12 failed attempts to find something that worked (I have some other issues preventing them from working well, that is in no way a normal or even reasonable number). I went through a period after each one where I swore I would never try another. I am glad I listened to my doctors.\n\n\nI have been told time and again that even if a medicine is horrible, the side effects will go away after the chemicals leave your system. Therefore, there is no long term loss to having to stop an ineffective medicine. Just bear in mind that if you are feeling worse on a medicine, it is an emergency. You need to get in contact with your prescribing doctor immediately or if they are unavailable, the ER. That is not a normal reaction.\n\n\nSo for all the doom and gloom, I promise it is worth the fight. "}, {"id": "2ok16e", "body": "I'm extremely depressed right now.

It is very normal to fear antidepressants, when I became depressed and ill in the late ' 90s, I too feared medication. However, I continued to spiral down towards a suicide attempt. I was given medication for the first time ever when I voluntarily committed myself. I knew I couldn't  continue on as I was and that I had to try something else or I would die. It has taken me many years and many doctors with various cocktails of meds to finally help me. Then there was my own stubbornness, I felt I didn't need the meds and would stop, then I'd get worse than before. My advise? Begin therapy, find a doctor you trust, make sure that when you do that you tell them everything about how you are feeling. When they give you meds, tell them about how they make you feel. Communication with your treatment team is key. Sure antidepressants aren't for everyone but if they are for you, they can make a difference in raising your quality of life as they did for me. I suffered for years and now I'm making progress because they finally find a combo that works. Also don't expect that what works today will work forever. During lifelong treatment you may have to occasionally change meds. Don't be afraid please, help is there and there are others who were where you are now who are doing better due to therapy and meds and coping skills. I am one of them.

Everyone can agree that the BCS was terrible but it did one huge thing: it removed \"style-point wins.\" Teams just had to win by a point or two rather than trying to \"impress\" voters with blowouts. Well, we appear to be back to that. The endless arguing over TCU/Baylor, or whether the B1G should have a team in the playoff because the B1G is weak, or whether FSU deserves to be in or not...it's an endlessly tedious discussion that is like arguing who would win in a cage match: Batman v. Superman. \n\nThere is no sport on this planet that tries to determine who the \"best\" team is for its championships. Very often the winner of the World Series or the Super Bowl or even March Madness isn't considered \"the best team.\" For some reason, college football holds on to the idea of crowing \"the Best\" white knuckled and in spite of any evidence to the contrary. \n\nThe argument logic \"if team A beats team B, and team B beats team C, then team A should beat team C\" is never true...it may be correlative but it surely isn't causitive. There are lots of teams who could lay claim to a championship because they beat a team that was ranked higher than them or had beaten a team who beat a team who was ranked higher than them.\n\nHere's my solution (and somewhat offline to my original question): have a 6-team playoff. The \"Big 5\" conferences all get in by virtue of their championship games...the Big 12 would have to get on board with this...and the 6th team in would be a play in game between the best ranked teams who are independent, mid-tier, or one of the next in line of the big 5 conferences.\n\nNFL fans, who are fans of teams who represent \"the best\" in the sport, are completely okay with watching, say, the Broncos and Patriots get knocked out of the first round of the playoffs, and seeing a wild card team (which far more losses than those other two teams) make it all the way to the Super Bowl. In fact, when the Giants beat the Patriots several years ago, we all rejoiced that the underdog won. \n\nSo the question is this: why can't the college football powers-that-be be okay with a simple 6-team playoff where the winners of the conferences get automatic bids regardless of their W/L record? Get rid of the committee and the constant yammering about who would win in the head to head and just let them play.\n\nEDIT: the 6-game playoff I mentioned is really just an idea of what else could be done. The real point of this CMV is that I believe the playoff is good idea but can be done better, i.e., get rid of the committee and narrow the bids to something more objective...like conference championship game winners and/or a limited play-in game. I would like you to change my view to see the current playoff system is well executed and is the best of all possible worlds.

In fact, when the Giants beat the Patriots several years ago, we all rejoiced that the underdog won. \n\nSo the question is this: why can't the college football powers-that-be be okay with a simple 6-team playoff where the winners of the conferences get automatic bids regardless of their W/L record?

It was only when the scar was struck again, during the finale, that the energy built up was released, and he could re-enter.\n\nHowever, you have to keep in mind that thematically, for the story to work, Aang had to fail on that day. The way that Aang react to the failure at the capitol, to the failure in the Earth Kingdom, shows how he has grown, and how he is ready, both physically and mentally, to take on the fire lord in the finale.\n\nThere's also the point that, even assuming they had enough waterbenders, the power of bending varies wildly between different people, and what a \"Master\" can do depends largely on what's required during the episode. From a story telling standpoint, they wouldn't be able to flood the city, because it would avoid any of the personal struggles they went through.\n\nI think the problem here is that you're looking at the story as a history, instead of a work of fiction. In good fiction, the easiest path isn't always taken. However, the path taken is the one that best fits the characters and their struggles. Drowning a city in water wouldn't have been a remotely satisfying ending to the show, and would have left countless character arcs open and unresolved. \n\nSo yes, I agree with you, that the invasion failing was Aang's fault, but the failure was necessary, not just for his own character arc, but the overall story, and the idea that Aang would fail, after rising from the last failure, was a surprising and intriguing development.

There is no amount of sex ed classes or rules that will stop teenagers from having sex. So we changed our collective viewpoint a bit and figured 'well, they're going to do it *anyway*, why not give them the things they need to be successful and healthy?' So now, slowly but surely, clinics are offering free condoms and sex ed classes are now taking an educating and preparing approach rather than trying to scare teens into not having sex. [And its working.]( http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/LifeStagesPopulations/TeenPregnancy/about)\n\nThe same goes for cannabis which is generating a lot of money at the taxpayer's benefit [source](http://mmjbusinessdaily.com/study-2-denver-cannabis-stores-create-30m-economic-impact-280-jobs/?nomobile=1). Soon, most or all states will be on board when they realize the goldmine that is the cannabis market.\n\nProstitution, I imagine, would behave the same way if legalized. Prostitution will always be around, despite the copious amounts of arrests and jail time handed out by the police each year. In it's current state, it is the epitome of crime. More and more minors are being forced to become prostitutes [due to the increasing demand for virgins]( http://mmjbusinessdaily.com/study-2-denver-cannabis-stores-create-30m-economic-impact-280-jobs/?nomobile=1) and many are also victims of abuse by both pimp, client, and parents. Lets not forget about STDs, which can spread like a fire though dry brush since the underground market rarely gives a damn I'd they're clean or not. Yet, it generates over [14 billion dollars]( https://www.courses.psu.edu/wmnst/wmnst001_atd1/Prostitution/facts.html) a year. Referring to that same link, we spend over 2 million fighting prostitution, money I believe can be spent elsewhere if it were decriminalized.\n\nI suspect the pros of legalizing prostituon outweigh the cons:\n\n-llegal sex trafficking would decrease since there would be a more legal, safer, healthier alternative for clients.\n\n-it creates jobs. New insurance companies would rise to the occasion to cater to prostitutes. They should offer birth control and hysterectomies for women and [birth control]( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/we-ll-have-male-birth-control-by-2017.html) and vasectomies for men, plus weekly/monthly STD checks. You'll need builders to make the facilities, managers to run the facilities, and let's not forget, workers. Bonus: lessens the chance for STDs to spread!\n\n-it will creates revenue. That $14 billion a year would definitely help out with our multi trillion dollar debt. In addition to that, we'd probably get more tourists than usual ;).\n\n-no education required. This can be both a pro and a con, depending on your view point. But if a college graduate is a part time prostitute, that student debt will be paid off in no time!\n\n-less violence. Workers are in a controlled, safer environment. There would probably be people there getting paid to keep the peace.\n\n\nThere are only a few cons I can think of:\n\n-won't look too good on a resume.

However, the first thing he tries to do is to get the girl away from the few people that *do* have a good influence on her. When he succeeds in that he can pretty much do anything he wants with her.

Instead he seeks out vulnerable girls, usually just above (or just under) the legal prostitution age with an unstable background (e.g. no parents, alcohol abuse in the family, etc.). He will at first portray himself as the ideal boyfriend: he brings gives, is nice and attentive, he just seems like an overall good guy. However, the first thing he tries to do is to get the girl away from the few people that *do* have a good influence on her. When he succeeds in that he can pretty much do anything he wants with her. Within no time he will get her into prostitution, with him making most, if not all, of the money. \n\nThe big problem with this is that officially the girls are voluntarily a prostitute. In practice they're not. The police cannot do anything about this until the girls themselves indicate they are forced to do so, something they don't do out of fear for repercussions or out of shame. \n \nNow the problem is that it's very hard to find good numbers to show how big of a problem this is, mostly because it's next to impossible to measure the size of this problem due to the same reasons as why the police can't do anything about it. However, it is a very real problem, and this problem can only exist when prostitution is legal. \n\n\nEDIT: I got many comparisons with pimps as replies, but there is a *very* distinct difference here: pimps are criminals thus the police can arrest them without any problems. Loverboys are technically not criminals until they're accused by their victims. When the police finds a pimp they can arrest him without any accusation of his victims. The victims might even have a good chance of getting out there with little or no punishment if it becomes clear they were (emotionally/physically) abused and forced into prostitution. The key is that just being a pimp here is enough to get arrested and to get an investigation started. Loverboys are no criminals until their victims says so, and even if the victim says so it's still very hard to get the loverboy convicted. They are almost untouchable, and this makes them *very* dangerous.\n\nBy the way, I am by no means an expert, I don't know any numbers, so I still might be completely wrong. I can just tell that pimps and loverboys are not the same, and that loverboys are much harder to lock up than pimps.\n\nEDIT2: /u/tgttgt linked me to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procuring_%28prostitution%29#Loverboy) that has some numbers (thanks!).

The key difference between loverboys and (illegal) pimps is that a loverboy can only be caught when his *victim* informs the police, because as long as she says she's doing it voluntarily the police cannot do anything, it's technically legal. With illegal pimps the police don't need the victim to inform them, just them being a pimp is enough to lock them up. This also shows why things like gangrape do not matter here: if the victim does not want to tell the police she's being forced into prostitution (= being raped daily), she will *definitely* not go to the police to tell she's gangraped by the very person that puts her into that position. Again, the police cannot do anything until the *victim* informs them. \n\nThis is pretty much given as the main reason why so little loverboys get convicted in the wikipedia article quoted.

There is no amount of sex ed classes or rules that will stop teenagers from having sex. So we changed our collective viewpoint a bit and figured 'well, they're going to do it *anyway*, why not give them the things they need to be successful and healthy?' So now, slowly but surely, clinics are offering free condoms and sex ed classes are now taking an educating and preparing approach rather than trying to scare teens into not having sex. [And its working.]( http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/LifeStagesPopulations/TeenPregnancy/about)\n\nThe same goes for cannabis which is generating a lot of money at the taxpayer's benefit [source](http://mmjbusinessdaily.com/study-2-denver-cannabis-stores-create-30m-economic-impact-280-jobs/?nomobile=1). Soon, most or all states will be on board when they realize the goldmine that is the cannabis market.\n\nProstitution, I imagine, would behave the same way if legalized. Prostitution will always be around, despite the copious amounts of arrests and jail time handed out by the police each year. In it's current state, it is the epitome of crime. More and more minors are being forced to become prostitutes [due to the increasing demand for virgins]( http://mmjbusinessdaily.com/study-2-denver-cannabis-stores-create-30m-economic-impact-280-jobs/?nomobile=1) and many are also victims of abuse by both pimp, client, and parents. Lets not forget about STDs, which can spread like a fire though dry brush since the underground market rarely gives a damn I'd they're clean or not. Yet, it generates over [14 billion dollars]( https://www.courses.psu.edu/wmnst/wmnst001_atd1/Prostitution/facts.html) a year. Referring to that same link, we spend over 2 million fighting prostitution, money I believe can be spent elsewhere if it were decriminalized.\n\nI suspect the pros of legalizing prostituon outweigh the cons:\n\n-llegal sex trafficking would decrease since there would be a more legal, safer, healthier alternative for clients.\n\n-it creates jobs. New insurance companies would rise to the occasion to cater to prostitutes. They should offer birth control and hysterectomies for women and [birth control]( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/we-ll-have-male-birth-control-by-2017.html) and vasectomies for men, plus weekly/monthly STD checks. You'll need builders to make the facilities, managers to run the facilities, and let's not forget, workers. Bonus: lessens the chance for STDs to spread!\n\n-it will creates revenue. That $14 billion a year would definitely help out with our multi trillion dollar debt. In addition to that, we'd probably get more tourists than usual ;).\n\n-no education required. This can be both a pro and a con, depending on your view point. But if a college graduate is a part time prostitute, that student debt will be paid off in no time!\n\n-less violence. Workers are in a controlled, safer environment. There would probably be people there getting paid to keep the peace.\n\n\nThere are only a few cons I can think of:\n\n-won't look too good on a resume. People's opinions/beliefs don't change overnight.\n\n-a competitive move by the black market (offering more minors, lowering prices) may lure more clients back in.\n\nMaybe someone else has more cons to add to the list?"}, {"id": "cmo262q", "body": "Couple of things:\n\n1) it would become a magnet job.

Prostitution is going to exist regardless of whether or not it's legal, and I think it's better for everyone involved if we control (and possibly tax) it rather than just sweeping it under the rug. The are many benefits to this approach including relieving some of the pressure on our already over crowded prisons, increasing safety and health of all parties involved, and controlling the spread of STDs.

During alcohol prohibition in the 20's alcohol use skyrocketed along with violent (and organized) crime. Marijuana prohibition has stopped literally no one from smoking pot, but has landed hundreds of thousands of people in jail and [ruined the lives of countless others](http://www.drugpolicy.org/drug-war-statistics).

Now that things are starting to shift towards legalization cartels are starting to [smuggle American marijuana into Mexico](http://rt.com/usa/210895-usa-marijuana-smuggle-mexico/). The Era of Mexican marijuana is essentially over, which is bad for the cartels. \n\nFurthermore, black marketeers don't care who or how old you are, as long as they get their money.

I'm not sure how exactly I stand on legalization but the argument goes like this, (With simplification of course.)\n\n&gt; Why spend millions to illegally traffic people when they could openly travel and be above board?\n\nIt can happen if the demand is still higher than the supply. Take this progression:\n\nPre-legalization:\n\nDemand can support 100 prostitutes, and right now there's only a supply of of 10 people who would/want to work while it's illegal, so traffickers try to meet the demand. Because it's criminalized, it's costs $10,000 to smuggle them in. Because of that, the market only generates enough capital to get 25 victim's trafficked since the cost is so high.\n\nAfter legalization:\n\nA lot more people want to work, and it's safer so let's say the demand goes up to 115 and the number of people who would willing want to prostitute goes up to something a lot higher, like 65 workers. So the demand-supply gap gets a lot closer but demand is still higher. So the traffickers come back, but this time, it's a lot cheaper to get people into the country. It only costs $5000, and assuming the same capital is available in both scenarios, that's enough to get 50 victims trafficked.\n\nSo even if most of the workers are voluntary, it can still increase the total amount of trafficked people. Then wages also come into play which can be tricky and not always foreseeable. Even if the there's more supply than demand, the involuntary workers may end up being cheaper than the voluntary. If you can get someone for $5000 and treat them like shit and take their earnings indefinitely or pay someone a good wage and provide good conditions but not pay the \"fee,\" the answer isn't exactly clear cut. \n\nAnd that's why legalization can be very bad. A lot of good can come from it, but the minority of bad can end up being extremely damaging.

Who's to say that we know better than they do? We have an understanding of our situations are based equipped to make choices for ourselves but we'e just people too, do we get to make choices for people whose situations we have no idea about?\n\nLastly something being illegal is more than saying something is wrong or you don't like something.

Many of today's laws are made with the idea that society knows better than the individual what is good for that individual. \n\nAlso, it should be noted that I have no idea how people tend to feel about having been a prostitute. I haven't read any studies or spoken to many prostitutes about it.
