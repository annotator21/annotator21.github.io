Men are in more danger, by a significant margin, and still somehow women are the ones taught to be careful, or are escorted home etc.  Also there are special laws protecting women (the violence against women act) more vigilantly than men.  Also the idea in general is that women are in MUCH more danger than men on the streets, when they're actually pretty significantly safer.\n\n&gt; I'm assuming this includes prison rapes. \n\nYes, and maybe not even.  Again, it was literally impossible for a woman to rape a man until like two years ago.  So there is no data as (here comes more privilege) only men have been prosecuted for rape.\n\n&gt; But it's not female privilege that male victims are disbelieved or dismissed for different reasons than female victims are disbelieved or dismissed.\n\nThe caliber of dismissing is WAY different.  Imagine if the regular response to a 13 year old girl being raped by her teacher was, \"Why would you snitch, you dyke?  You're so lucky, I wish it were me!\". You would burn that school to the ground.\n\n&gt; Breast cancer doesn't need more awareness. \n\nIts society caring about women and not caring about men.\n\n&gt; Where do you get that idea? \n\nIts a theme here.  The root of basically all female privilege I've ever heard of is \" society gives a shit about women and not men\".  Women are 56% of campuses, but they still get women-only scholarships.  Remember when that woman cut her husband's dick off and threw it in the disposal and Sharon Osbourne made jokes about it on daytime TV to cackling hordes of women?  Remember the fallout from Daniel Tosh jokijgly telling a heckler he wished she was raped?  \n\nMan up comes from the idea that nobody cares you're upset, shut up and get moving.\n\n&gt; I experience white privilege when I sneak a waterbottle through security in the airport without worrying about someone assuming I'm in ISIS.\n\nMe and my girlfriend went to rome and Italy a few months ago and we did NOT share your comfort.  We didn't even get in line to try.  I have no idea why you thought that'd be okay.  Hell, when I went to Florida when I was a teenager, they confiscated my slealed pack of travel Axe.\n\nWhite privilege really extends to cops and loans.  \n\nIncidentally, I honestly can't think of anything I would consider black privilege (to stick with my analogy).  They unilaterally have it worse or equal to white people, which is why there's no such thing.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmwmsyk", "body": "That might be the case for your situation.

What is meant by benevolent sexism is that, on it's face it seems to be trying to give women privileges, but what it's actually used for in practice is a cultural method through which to police a woman's behavior.\n\nSo, \"women are fragile creatures who should be protected\" turns into, \"No, you shouldn't be allowed to work even if you are single mother. You are fragile, so you literally can't handle any sort of work a man could do, and you are meant to be protected, but what that actually means is that you need to remarry, and then do whatever your new husband says\". You are looking at the rhetoric and ignoring what the reality actually is/was. People often bring up the military, but did you know that women are fighting to be able to serve on the front lines?

So I'm not sure how relevant this point is to this particular CMV or the wider conversation.  Taking your comment on its own however, I still have two problems:\n\n1. Feminists seem to want to be the end-all-be-all of sex/gender inequality issues these days, however they only seem to want to pay lip service to female privilege at best or ignore it at worst.  Certainly although women have always held certain privileges over men I don't think anyone would argue against the notion that even in recent history the balance of privilege has been disproportionately in the favor of men so this perspective is understandable.  I think it is unclear to exactly what degree this is still true today, though, and eventually if we continue squashing any discussion of female privilege or writing it off as \"benevolent sexism\" while always framing male privilege as \"unfair advantage\" then it is certain that the balance of privilege will necessarily be in favor of women if it is not already.  The feminist movement has not adopted a sustainable approach to sex/gender equality, they have adopted a mechanism that disproportionately improves advantages for women, not one that disproportionately improves the advantage of the disadvantaged.  This was fine for when \"female\" was clearly synonymous with \"disadvantaged\" but if feminism is (or already has been) effective then that fact and the basis of much of feminist thought and methodologies will cease to be valid.\n\n2. I think you're assuming far too much about the reasons behind the pressure placed on men in order to frame it as \"positive\" vs \"negative\" reinforcement (actually both typically experience both positive and negative reinforcement and punishment in the standard psychological meanings of these terms since in both cases derision is removed and praise added for adherent behavior while conversely derision is added and praise removed for the case of divergent behavior).  This perspective is, again, exactly the problem I (and I think OP) are concerned with.  In this view--so far as I can tell--the only thing that makes the different pressures \"positive\" or \"negative\" are the gender of the person receiving them.  If you want to disagree with point then you find yourself in the awkward position of either claiming that men are simply naturally predisposed to violence/murder (a claim for which I would expect quite a lot of evidence) or hypocritically claiming that the presumed intent of a given societal pressure are what define whether or not it is \"positive\" or \"negative\" and not its results *but only for men since it is clear that outcomes not intent are what concerns feminists about the impact of gender roles on women*.  The simple fact is that men don't want to be pigeonholed anymore than women do but any discussion of this is constantly derailed by essentially claiming \"but the type of pigeonholing that men are subject to is advantageous/desirable!\"\n\nedit: cleared up some phrasing"}, {"id": "cmwwlik", "body": "I think most feminists tend to agree that men being pushed by society into acting more violently is an equally bad thing.\n\nThis is basically what they mean by \"the patriarchy forcing everyone into societal roles\" and why it's so shitty.

In other words, the benefits they would enjoy from these skills are less than the benefits a white man would enjoy, all other things being equal. This disincentivizes women and minorities from seeking an education in the first place, and a perceived difference in skills becomes a real difference.\n\nSo the \"choices\" explanation misses the fact that those choices are conditioned by discrimination from the very beginning. Disregarding the reasoning for those choices is ignorant to say the least.

Richard Gelles, author of a study widely quoted by masculinists (Kimmel, 2013, p. 20), wrote that it is false to imply that the number of battered men and women is equal (Kimmel, 2013, p. 120) and that women are 7 times as likely to be injured as men by domestic partners and twice as likely to be murdered (McGee, 2004) (other statistics indicate they are 4 times as likely to be murdered (Dragiewicz, 2011, p. 95)). The Futurist ignores the context of the data and neglects to explain how, if gender is purely biological, one can explain symmetrical violence, and why, if there are presumably legions of severely abused men, is he not advocating for a massive increase in funding for men's shelters, as Kimmel asks of Men's Rights groups in Angry White Men. The answer, suggests Kimmel, is that masculinists of this stripe are not interested in helping men \u2013 they are interested in discrediting women (Kimmel, 2013, p. 120).\n\nSources cited in this paragraph:\n\n- Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime.
