This is to avoid awkward confrontations and confusion.\n\nIt's more because most of the world was for heterosexuals, and heterosexuals had a habit of killing, imprisoning, and torturing gay people. Gay bars were an escape. It wasn't some purposeful division that gay people agreed to. Also, this supposed agreement isn't written down anywhere, real, or communicated to anyone.\n\n&gt;This directly conflicts with most people's fundamental instincts, and it can be quite jarring. \n\nOr say, if you expected a certain level of vaginal lubrication, depth, hair length, breast shape, etc. \n\nSomething being jarring is fine. You are free to retreat. Being annoyed at the person for being something you didn't ask is less reasonable.\n\n&gt;As a precaution, one should state how they don't conform to the context.\n\nThere are a vast number of potentially jarring contexts, being trans is hardly the only one.\n\n&gt;A transperson knows how perilous it can be to date in a cis-geared world.\n\nPartly because it's socially sanctioned to be angry at them if they are discovered. Obviously this is a strong reason to not disclose.\n\n&gt;It is nearly callous to expect that not disclosing some germane facts shouldn't matter.\n\nThen the vast majority are callous, because there is a large list of germane facts that matter to many- race, religion, region, wealth etc, that people don't disclose.\n\nMore realistically, being trans is singled out because people don't like trans people much, but most people have a religion, race, and wealth and don't really care enough to say it to everyone because it'd kill the mood.\n\n&gt;This isn't really a reasonable comparison. You're equating a straight guy at a presumably straight bar picking up a presumed woman to straight guy at a presumably transphobic straight bar picking up a presumed woman. That is such a leap.\n\nPeople being transphobic is fairly common, it's a reasonable assumption to make.\n\n&gt;Further, there's nothing wrong with transpeople or the sex in which they engage. Maybe that's just not the kind of sex OP's brother is into.

Almost everyone will have a number of relatively unusual aspects to them that someone could find reason to hate.\n\nYou don't have to be a sociology expert to know that the majority of people are straight and non-trans, that dating and sex are high-stress scenarios in a lot of ways, and that people are gonna feel like they've been fucked with if they find out that your biological sex is the opposite of what they thought it was once you've already had your tongue in their mouth. \n\nEverything you wrote about being Scottish/royal is completely irrelevant. Scottishness and royalty are not so inherent to your hormones or the structure of your sex organs that it could cause you to appear physically attractive to someone who is repulsed by your genitalia. It's completely disingenuous for you to equate these things to being trans.\n\n&gt; people aren't always going to tick whatever arbitrary boxes you have.\n\nIt's hardly arbitrary to want to know if the biological sex of the person you're in an intimate encounter with isn't what it appears to be. Maybe you're right, and decades on our social mores will dictate otherwise, but for now they don't. This is not some \"extensive set of rules\" that's being randomly imposed by bigots on those of you who are more enlightened. It's just the reality that this confusion can occur when trans people are involved, and cause considerable problems for people, and the party who is aware of that potential should take steps to prevent it. \n\n&gt; A number of transphobic people, on the other hand, are utterly disgusted by the thought, hate the idea of contact with a trans person and say they are not transphobic, even though they have an instinctual disgust to the idea of contact with anyone who is trans. \n\nThis CMV is not a defense of transphobia. The OP is not about hating trans people, or trying to avoid them because he hates them. It's about being honest about your biological sex with potential partners.\n\nMany, perhaps most people, myself (and quite probably OP's brother) included, don't hate the idea of contact with a trans person (although he might now). We *do* hate the idea of *sexual* contact with a trans person, especially one who is not of our preferred biological sex. Whether you think it's a product of society notwithstanding, being repulsed by genitalia of the non-preferred sex is completely normal and has been for a long time.\n\n&gt; If you don't have any disagreement with their existence why is it bad if you sleep with them?\n\nLudicrous. So I must hate fat people now because I don't want to have sex with them? How about straight, non-trans men? Do I automatically hate them or have a problem with their existence because I don't want to have sex with them? \n\nThe political opinion thing is completely irrelevant because it doesn't affect physical attraction, or inspire physical revulsion, except perhaps in the extremely immature or demagogic. Which reminds me, if you would feel violated by an otherwise physically attractive person with whom you consented to sex later revealing something completely irrelevant to sexual attraction, which he or she had no way of knowing would affect your decision to sleep with them, you are working with a completely different definition of \"violated\" from most people.\n\n&gt; I expect people to be chill and not hate on people for not fully disclosing non harmful things.\n\nBut in many cases trans status is only harmless *if it's disclosed.* If not, it can cause extreme unpleasantness for all parties involved, as we've seen in the OP. \n\n&gt; As I noted above, there are lots of arbitrary things that could potentially turn someone off about a sexual encounter and appear deceptive. If you've decided that someone being trans is the thing that really matters, that if you're not informed then that person is bad and dishonest then you are being rather arbitrary and random and trans people shouldn't be expected to oblige your whims. If you want to know, ask.\n\nOkay, for the last time, biological sex is not arbitrary to a sexual encounter. In fact, it's 90% of what matters in many sexual encounters. Besides, you can't seriously expect people who want to have sex on a regular basis to go around asking potential partners if they're actually the opposite sex. If trans people made up even ten percent of the population maybe you'd have an argument that it would just be prudent to ask, but as it is they're fewer than 1%, and to ask would be commonly taken as insulting. \n\n&gt;&gt;Somehow I doubt there are many trans people accidentally sleeping with people who hate them on the basis of their transition status.\n\n&gt;OP's situation is an example of such, so it probably does happen.\n\n&gt;OP likely isn't aware of the common hatecrimes against trans people and so wasn't aware of the consequences of his desires.\n\nNow this is just bullshit and you really should be ashamed of yourself for slinging it.

Almost everyone will have a number of relatively unusual aspects to them that someone could find reason to hate.\n\nYou don't have to be a sociology expert to know that the majority of people are straight and non-trans, that dating and sex are high-stress scenarios in a lot of ways, and that people are gonna feel like they've been fucked with if they find out that your biological sex is the opposite of what they thought it was once you've already had your tongue in their mouth. \n\nEverything you wrote about being Scottish/royal is completely irrelevant.

Maybe you're right, and decades on our social mores will dictate otherwise, but for now they don't. This is not some \"extensive set of rules\" that's being randomly imposed by bigots on those of you who are more enlightened. It's just the reality that this confusion can occur when trans people are involved, and cause considerable problems for people, and the party who is aware of that potential should take steps to prevent it. \n\n&gt; A number of transphobic people, on the other hand, are utterly disgusted by the thought, hate the idea of contact with a trans person and say they are not transphobic, even though they have an instinctual disgust to the idea of contact with anyone who is trans. \n\nThis CMV is not a defense of transphobia. The OP is not about hating trans people, or trying to avoid them because he hates them. It's about being honest about your biological sex with potential partners.\n\nMany, perhaps most people, myself (and quite probably OP's brother) included, don't hate the idea of contact with a trans person (although he might now). We *do* hate the idea of *sexual* contact with a trans person, especially one who is not of our preferred biological sex. Whether you think it's a product of society notwithstanding, being repulsed by genitalia of the non-preferred sex is completely normal and has been for a long time.\n\n&gt; If you don't have any disagreement with their existence why is it bad if you sleep with them?\n\nLudicrous. So I must hate fat people now because I don't want to have sex with them? How about straight, non-trans men? Do I automatically hate them or have a problem with their existence because I don't want to have sex with them? \n\nThe political opinion thing is completely irrelevant because it doesn't affect physical attraction, or inspire physical revulsion, except perhaps in the extremely immature or demagogic. Which reminds me, if you would feel violated by an otherwise physically attractive person with whom you consented to sex later revealing something completely irrelevant to sexual attraction, which he or she had no way of knowing would affect your decision to sleep with them, you are working with a completely different definition of \"violated\" from most people.\n\n&gt; I expect people to be chill and not hate on people for not fully disclosing non harmful things.\n\nBut in many cases trans status is only harmless *if it's disclosed.* If not, it can cause extreme unpleasantness for all parties involved, as we've seen in the OP. \n\n&gt; As I noted above, there are lots of arbitrary things that could potentially turn someone off about a sexual encounter and appear deceptive. If you've decided that someone being trans is the thing that really matters, that if you're not informed then that person is bad and dishonest then you are being rather arbitrary and random and trans people shouldn't be expected to oblige your whims. If you want to know, ask.\n\nOkay, for the last time, biological sex is not arbitrary to a sexual encounter. In fact, it's 90% of what matters in many sexual encounters. Besides, you can't seriously expect people who want to have sex on a regular basis to go around asking potential partners if they're actually the opposite sex. If trans people made up even ten percent of the population maybe you'd have an argument that it would just be prudent to ask, but as it is they're fewer than 1%, and to ask would be commonly taken as insulting. \n\n&gt;&gt;Somehow I doubt there are many trans people accidentally sleeping with people who hate them on the basis of their transition status.\n\n&gt;OP's situation is an example of such, so it probably does happen.\n\n&gt;OP likely isn't aware of the common hatecrimes against trans people and so wasn't aware of the consequences of his desires.\n\nNow this is just bullshit and you really should be ashamed of yourself for slinging it.

On the other hand, current sexual organs seem to be very related to the comfort and arousal of the people involved. For post-op trans people, I'm less certain of my opinion for one night stands.\n\nFor longer term relationships though, there is a definite importance to confide certain things: If you have a kid already, you should admit that at some point early in the relationship to make sure your partner is okay with that, for example. Things like politics, race, and religion could definitely be a dealbreaker for some people, but (from my perspective without researching studies) are not overly frequent dealbreakers.

So that rule is violated if they start fights. \n\n&gt;Besides, you can't seriously expect people who want to have sex on a regular basis to go around asking potential partners if they're actually the opposite sex. If trans people made up even ten percent of the population maybe you'd have an argument that it would just be prudent to ask, but as it is they're fewer than 1%, and to ask would be commonly taken as insulting. \n\nThis is an issue for trans people too- people take it as insulting that they exist.

When they presented a male them that was a false face. They aren't necessarily going to feel deceptive.\n\n&gt;Everything you wrote about being Scottish/royal is completely irrelevant. Scottishness and royalty are not so inherent to your hormones or the structure of your sex organs that it could cause you to appear physically attractive to someone who is repulsed by your genitalia. It's completely disingenuous for you to equate these things to being trans.\n\nSomeone who is physically attracted to you could then feel repulsed by you due to your race. You feel that genitals is an ok reason to feel repulsed by someone, I don't. I don't believe in mandating that feelings become a rule.

Lots of people have partial masculinization or feminization or differ in certain ways from the stereotype. You can draw the dividing line in lots of arbitrary places. Anyway, regardless of social moors, it doesn't actually harm anyone if you do sleep with someone not up to your standards.\n\n&gt;Many, perhaps most people, myself (and quite probably OP's brother) included, don't hate the idea of contact with a trans person (although he might now). We do hate the idea of sexual contact with a trans person, especially one who is not of our preferred biological sex. Whether you think it's a product of society notwithstanding, being repulsed by genitalia of the non-preferred sex is completely normal and has been for a long time.\n\nYes, as homophobia and transphobia. An instinctual repulsion to romantic contact between people of the same sex. Some people obviously are repulsed by genitals in general, their feelings should be catered to, but most people who are 'repulsed' aren't actually repulsed in the majority of situations.

I'm not gay or transgendered but I have friends who are and I don't really want coitus with someone who is hateful and cruel.

You're arguing that transgendered people should disclose the information about their status so that the types of people who like to beat them up, kill them, abuse them and such can know who they are.

Fertility used to be quite relevant to sex, the main point of it actually, but these days it's become so far down the list that the majority of young western couples regularly employ methods to specifically prevent it. I expect that the genitalia you're born with (regardless of whether you choose to surgically change it to resemble the other sex's at some point) is destined for a similar fate. Sure the *majority* of female babies may indefinitely identify with the female gender and same as with males, but the small minority of males that choose later in life to identify as female and vice versa should not be discriminated against or humiliated for their innate genitalia so long as they exude femininity enough to elicit sexual attraction from their desired partner group.

What about if we're talking about a post-op transgender person? There's no penis now, would you still have a problem?\n\n&gt; It's tricking my biology. It is not informed consent.\n\nYour biology wasn't tricked, that's the ludicrous statement. You looked at them and were attracted to them but you're not attracted to what's in their pants.

Outwardly, if a person exudes femininity (long silky hair, makeup, enhances eyelashes, lipstick, boobs, shaved legs, etc.) and identifies as a woman, their genitalia (past or present form) is as irrelevant as whether they're fertile. We're in the early stages of transgender progressivism so I don't expect most or even many otherwise liberal people to necessarily agree with me on this subject, nor a multitude of other subjects that I won't go into. But it's the way I see things. \n\nI don't see \"2014 morals\" as the end-all to what's right or wrong sexually. I try to be as objective as possible. I think that if a man is attracted to \"women\", i.e. feminine qualities, and a transgender person has every appearance and quality of a woman except the genitals they were uncontrollably born with, they have no obligation to disclose any of this to an otherwise willing sexual partner.... until, obviously, that partner literally sees their male genitalia and decides to end sexual consent."}, {"id": "cmq6z3h", "body": "No matter how you slice it, not everyone wants to have sex with transgender people, just like not everyone wants to have sex with just anyone. \n\nIf you have information about yourself that you think, once disclosed, it would change the decision of a potential sex partner, you need to disclose that."}, {"id": "2oqech", "body": "My little brother had a rather strange night this past weekend.

While I am an LGBT ally and a very sex positive person, my little brother is much more neutral on these issues, leaning more towards conservative ideals. He feels like he's been \"lied\" to and \"violated\", and I think he's right. \n\nMy argument is based on the assumption that a significant percentage of the population wouldn't otherwise have sex with a transgender person if that information were to be disclosed. Therefore, it is not moral for a transgender person to put someone at risk for taking actions they would otherwise regret. A transgender person is responsible for consent during sex that is fully informed. \n\nThere exists a very real, and I'd argue dominating, belief amongst the populace that having sex with a transgender man or woman isn't the same as having sex with a \"born\" man or woman. While the truth of this is matter is up for debate, \"truth\" in this situation is irrelevant. What is relevant is that a great deal (probably majority) of straight men and women wouldn't feel comfortable having sex with a transgender individual. This isn't necessarily \"fair\" or \"right\", but a fact that anyone, *especially* a transgender person who has been made to face those sorts of prejudices. \n\nTo not disclose this information is dishonest and wrong. By not disclosing this information, a transgender person is knowingly having sex with an individual who probably wouldn't be comfortable with it otherwise. While the cases are certainly not identical, this is akin to keeping sexual diseases a secret. Let's say I have herpes. I need to assume that a sizable, if not the majority, of people I want to sleep with would refuse to do so if I disclose this information. While some people might say, \"Herpes isn't a big deal, and if you don't have an outbreak my chances of getting it are low. Let's have sex.\" But to assume that is not moral, and failing to disclose this information takes a way fully informed consent. \n\n**EDITED: She gave my brother head, sorry to make that unclear.**"}, {"id": "cmq11im", "body": "It's not immoral because nobody's rights are violated, but it's a dick move.

Dictionary.com defines orphan as \"a child who has lost both parents through death, or, less commonly, one parent.\" If the person in question is not a child, he or she cannot not by definition be an orphan. And while there may there may be arguments for both sides in deciding if an 18 year old is a child, no such ambiguity exists as to whether you can be 70 and be a child, be 100 and be a child, or be however old (55?) Funkhouser is and be a child. Thus, since people of theses ages can never be considered children, one can not be \"70 and be an orphan,\" \"100 and be an orphan,\" or be however old (55?) Funkhouser is and be an orphan.\n\nTherefore, the Funk Man- despite his being one of Larry David's most formidable rivals/antagonists (along with Susie and Wanda) in Larry's never-ending battle to enforce his person ethical principals and codes of conduct onto the outside world- is inarguably WRONG HERE. Ipso facto, our hero Larry David wins again.\n\nCMV, and explain to me how Funkhouser won this round (i.e. Marty Funkhouser, as a result of the deaths of both of his parents while he is in his 50s, can be considered an orphan, which was Funkhouser's original contention).\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Their politics have never led to anything but misery and war. People who buy into their ideology either have deeply vested interests or are insanely gullible.\n\nFar right ideologies pander to the basest of human emotions, and this is something that should always be kept in check. \n\nA list of some of the characteristics of the far right tends to embrace: celebrating social inequality, bigotry, racism, selfish individualism, materialism, conspicuous  consumerism, religious fundamentalism, anti-intellectualism, pride, prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, greed, social conservatism, patriarchy, social hierarchy, persecution complexes, victim complexes, scapegoating minorities, warmongering, pseudo-science, superstition and deeply regressive religious beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, none of these traits in humans should be encouraged, and we should strive towards a fair and free society. Right wing groups are almost always the people stopping us from getting closer to utopia.\n\nUltimately, I believe the various flavors of the far-right: extremist religious conservatives like Islamists, jesus camp sorts and neo-conservatives in the GOP are very similar and equally dangerous.\n\nI believe this kind of thinking is a sickness that needs to be purged. It's impractical to put people who adhere to this ideology in death camps, and neither would that solve anything. But I think the world should make a concerted effort to completely stamp out this sort of thinking. \n\nChildren should be taught how dangerous these ideologies are. Far-right groups should not have any freedom of speech whatsoever.\n\nI think far-left ideologies have been for the most part eliminated from the world outside of very fringe areas, and since communism has failed for the most part it rarely gets political prominence. But the far right still exists, and wields considerable power.\n\nAfter the Great Depression of the early 20th century, far-right politics left devastation in its wake. After the economic woes of the 2008 financial crisis and as a counter to Islamism emanating from the middle east (which is *also* a far right idelogy), we are seeing the far-right emerge in parts of Europe, and even America. We are heading towards another catastrophe. We simply aren't learning from history.\n\n\n----\n\nEdit: I'm not talking about American politics exclusively, but rather the global problem of extremist ideologies and the far-right in particular. \n\nBy \"far right\" i DO NOT mean republicans in general or anyone that's just slightly right of center.

Their politics have never led to anything but misery and war. People who buy into their ideology either have deeply vested interests or are insanely gullible.\n\nFar right ideologies pander to the basest of human emotions, and this is something that should always be kept in check. \n\nA list of some of the characteristics of the far right tends to embrace: celebrating social inequality, bigotry, racism, selfish individualism, materialism, conspicuous  consumerism, religious fundamentalism, anti-intellectualism, pride, prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, greed, social conservatism, patriarchy, social hierarchy, persecution complexes, victim complexes, scapegoating minorities, warmongering, pseudo-science, superstition and deeply regressive religious beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, none of these traits in humans should be encouraged, and we should strive towards a fair and free society. Right wing groups are almost always the people stopping us from getting closer to utopia.\n\nUltimately, I believe the various flavors of the far-right: extremist religious conservatives like Islamists, jesus camp sorts and neo-conservatives in the GOP are very similar and equally dangerous.\n\nI believe this kind of thinking is a sickness that needs to be purged. It's impractical to put people who adhere to this ideology in death camps, and neither would that solve anything. But I think the world should make a concerted effort to completely stamp out this sort of thinking. \n\nChildren should be taught how dangerous these ideologies are. Far-right groups should not have any freedom of speech whatsoever.\n\nI think far-left ideologies have been for the most part eliminated from the world outside of very fringe areas, and since communism has failed for the most part it rarely gets political prominence. But the far right still exists, and wields considerable power.\n\nAfter the Great Depression of the early 20th century, far-right politics left devastation in its wake. After the economic woes of the 2008 financial crisis and as a counter to Islamism emanating from the middle east (which is *also* a far right idelogy), we are seeing the far-right emerge in parts of Europe, and even America. We are heading towards another catastrophe. We simply aren't learning from history.\n\n\n----\n\nEdit: I'm not talking about American politics exclusively, but rather the global problem of extremist ideologies and the far-right in particular. \n\nBy \"far right\" i DO NOT mean republicans in general or anyone that's just slightly right of center. I'm talking about right-wing radicals, the fringes. They are a vocal minority but nevertheless wield considerable power and have done a lot of real damage to the world.\n\nAnd here's a link to the documentary \"Power of Nightmares\" by Adam Curtis, that I'm basing some of the stuff here on: https://archive.org/details/ThePowerOfNightmares-Episode1BabyItsColdOutside"}, {"id": "cmpe910", "body": "I guess right off the bat, I'd really like for you to actually give an idea as to what you consider to be \"far-right\" - it is hard to be what I believe to be a very middle-of-the-road conservative when the *instant* I mention something that is disagreed with, I am immediately exaggerated away to points I \"supposedly\" believe in, even though I myself think they are ridiculous.  \n  \nMy point being, there will always be party fanatics out there...

Keep in mind that in the traditional English common law, the church and state are *not* separate, and the Church of England is a government institution as much as the courts of law or the armed forces.  Indeed, the English Civil War was prompted by Charles I attempting to impose the Book of Common Prayer in Scotland.\n\nAll that is to say that marriage is and always has been as much a legal institution as a religious one.  Property has always transferred through marriage, and political and social status was directly tied to whom one was married to.  Additionally, other benefits outside property such as the spousal privilege in court and medical decision making are tied to marriage.\n\nFurther, with the rise of immigration systems in the 1800s and 1900s, a really fundamental right of sponsoring one's spouse to migrate has been attached to marriage.  \n\nThere is a pretty strong conservative case for same sex marriage.  Marriage is an important traditional institution which promotes stable families and has been well settled in law.  Inviting gay people into that institution is superior to creating new and less stable institutions that may encourage people not to settle into longstanding relationships, or stigmatize them as second class citizens, unworthy of full participation in civil society."}, {"id": "cmpe910", "body": "I guess right off the bat, I'd really like for you to actually give an idea as to what you consider to be \"far-right\" - it is hard to be what I believe to be a very middle-of-the-road conservative when the *instant* I mention something that is disagreed with, I am immediately exaggerated away to points I \"supposedly\" believe in, even though I myself think they are ridiculous.  \n  \nMy point being, there will always be party fanatics out there...
