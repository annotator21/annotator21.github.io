Parents (even parents that are still together) are expected to support their children to an extent that is commensurate with their abilities.\n\n&gt;but by that logic anyone who can't afford a child shouldn't be having sex\n\nThey shouldn't be, especially if they are a man, because men don't get to choose when a pregnancy is terminated. Your viewing that as something that breaks the system, but it doesn't really matter.  It's going to \"break\" any system of child support just as much, because men can't get pregnant.  Men choose to accept responsibility when they choose to have sex. Women get to choose over a longer period of time, but both get to make a choice.  Besides, if the woman brings the baby to term and the man wants to keep it or share custody, he has the opportunity to do that.

Some also consider age of the child, difference in income between parents, standard of living adjustments, etc. \n\nIn theory I get it, but the implications in practice really bother me and I think the basis behind the laws regulating child support calculation are a little outdated and unfair. \n\nHere's a summary of my objections: \n\n* Above a certain amount why should income be taken into account? For example, let's consider two friends Jane and Anna. Jane has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $25k per year and Anna has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $150k per year. Assuming both women have similar incomes and lifestyles before children, most child support calculations would award Anna much more child support than Jane. But why? Is Anna's child more deserving of money than Jane's child?\n\n* Why should calculations assume a relationship or marriage? Many child support calculations are based on the income that would have been dedicated to the child if the parents lived together. If a woman gets pregnant from a one night stand or a non-serious relationship, why should there be any assumption by the courts that the parents would have lived together and raised the child together? A married couple living together with children spend their income differently than single people without children. So why should a relationship be assumed and considered when it did not exist in the first place?\n\n* Why is standard of living important? Some child support calculations take into account the accustomed or increased standard of living when calculating support amounts. Let's be honest here, is there ever really a need for $5k per month in child support? Just because someone is wealthy, why does that mean they are automatically expected to provide a high level of financial support to their children. Where exactly is that money going? In most cases it isn't all going to the child and I think that is problematic. The point of child support money is for support of the child, not the creation of an expensive lifestyle for the child and custodial parent. \n\nIn my opinion, a basic formula should be developed (adjusted for cost of living by area) that accounts for the average amount required to support a child's basic monthly needs at varying age levels. This amount would take into account food, transportation, clothing, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. The child support amount could be then simply read off a table rather than dedicating time and resources into courts and legal decisions. \n\nIf this amount is more than 15% of monthly net income, the child support paying parent would be limited to pay 15% as support for that child. A parent shouldn't be struggling financially to pay their own bills in order to be able to keep up with child support payments. \n\nFor parents where this amount is less than 15% of monthly net income, they would pay the set amount as given by the formula.\n\nIf parents have 50/50 joint custody, there would be no child support awarded, because both parents should be equally supporting the child. For other custody situations the child support amount would be calculated down or up based on custody percentage. \n\nSo am I missing something here? To me what I've described above seems to be a much fairer system than the way child support is currently calculated. So please, CMV. \n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Assuming both women have similar incomes and lifestyles before children, most child support calculations would award Anna much more child support than Jane. But why? Is Anna's child more deserving of money than Jane's child?\n\n* Why should calculations assume a relationship or marriage? Many child support calculations are based on the income that would have been dedicated to the child if the parents lived together. If a woman gets pregnant from a one night stand or a non-serious relationship, why should there be any assumption by the courts that the parents would have lived together and raised the child together?

Some child support calculations take into account the accustomed or increased standard of living when calculating support amounts. Let's be honest here, is there ever really a need for $5k per month in child support? Just because someone is wealthy, why does that mean they are automatically expected to provide a high level of financial support to their children. Where exactly is that money going? In most cases it isn't all going to the child and I think that is problematic. The point of child support money is for support of the child, not the creation of an expensive lifestyle for the child and custodial parent. \n\nIn my opinion, a basic formula should be developed (adjusted for cost of living by area) that accounts for the average amount required to support a child's basic monthly needs at varying age levels. This amount would take into account food, transportation, clothing, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. The child support amount could be then simply read off a table rather than dedicating time and resources into courts and legal decisions. \n\nIf this amount is more than 15% of monthly net income, the child support paying parent would be limited to pay 15% as support for that child. A parent shouldn't be struggling financially to pay their own bills in order to be able to keep up with child support payments. \n\nFor parents where this amount is less than 15% of monthly net income, they would pay the set amount as given by the formula.\n\nIf parents have 50/50 joint custody, there would be no child support awarded, because both parents should be equally supporting the child.

Some also consider age of the child, difference in income between parents, standard of living adjustments, etc. \n\nIn theory I get it, but the implications in practice really bother me and I think the basis behind the laws regulating child support calculation are a little outdated and unfair. \n\nHere's a summary of my objections: \n\n* Above a certain amount why should income be taken into account? For example, let's consider two friends Jane and Anna. Jane has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $25k per year and Anna has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $150k per year. Assuming both women have similar incomes and lifestyles before children, most child support calculations would award Anna much more child support than Jane. But why? Is Anna's child more deserving of money than Jane's child?\n\n* Why should calculations assume a relationship or marriage? Many child support calculations are based on the income that would have been dedicated to the child if the parents lived together. If a woman gets pregnant from a one night stand or a non-serious relationship, why should there be any assumption by the courts that the parents would have lived together and raised the child together? A married couple living together with children spend their income differently than single people without children. So why should a relationship be assumed and considered when it did not exist in the first place?\n\n* Why is standard of living important? Some child support calculations take into account the accustomed or increased standard of living when calculating support amounts. Let's be honest here, is there ever really a need for $5k per month in child support? Just because someone is wealthy, why does that mean they are automatically expected to provide a high level of financial support to their children. Where exactly is that money going? In most cases it isn't all going to the child and I think that is problematic. The point of child support money is for support of the child, not the creation of an expensive lifestyle for the child and custodial parent. \n\nIn my opinion, a basic formula should be developed (adjusted for cost of living by area) that accounts for the average amount required to support a child's basic monthly needs at varying age levels. This amount would take into account food, transportation, clothing, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. The child support amount could be then simply read off a table rather than dedicating time and resources into courts and legal decisions. \n\nIf this amount is more than 15% of monthly net income, the child support paying parent would be limited to pay 15% as support for that child. A parent shouldn't be struggling financially to pay their own bills in order to be able to keep up with child support payments. \n\nFor parents where this amount is less than 15% of monthly net income, they would pay the set amount as given by the formula.\n\nIf parents have 50/50 joint custody, there would be no child support awarded, because both parents should be equally supporting the child. For other custody situations the child support amount would be calculated down or up based on custody percentage. \n\nSo am I missing something here? To me what I've described above seems to be a much fairer system than the way child support is currently calculated. So please, CMV. \n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For other custody situations the child support amount would be calculated down or up based on custody percentage. \n\nSo am I missing something here? To me what I've described above seems to be a much fairer system than the way child support is currently calculated. So please, CMV. \n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It can lead to some really hurtful times if one person thinks they are entering into a serious relationship and the other is just looking for no-strings-attached sex.\n\nPerhaps you could say a promise not to fall in love is not the ideal way of phrasing it, as we're not really capable of controlling such things.  That being said, such an agreement is far from pointless.  It sets boundaries and expectations for the relationship.  That's very important.

If either starts to have strong emotions, they should consider backing out.  Yes, like in any relationship there's still ultimately the potential for hurt feelings, but at least this way you could say each individual is making a fully informed decision to have sex.\n\nFar from being pointless, this is like a thousand times better than sex when the two people have different understandings about the significance of the sex and the direction of the relationship.

Is it because in US you use to cut it...?  \n-Woman usually moan during sex and men don't. Well, yeah. If I hit Billy and Jenny with same strength, Billy goes Uh oh and Jenny is like Aaaoaoaoaoaoa. Does that mean I hit her stronger?  \n-Multiple orgasm. People still say this, yet they ignore the fact that men are also capable of this...  \n-Dude, some women go crazy during orgasm with shaking legs etc.! Have you ever seen men doing this?! Yup, I did and you can too if you spare 15 seconds to google it and next 10 minutes to watch the film...  \n-But there are some researches saying that woman orgasm is more intense! Yeah, probably there are, but I've never seen them containing multiorgasmic man, prostate orgasm or anal orgasm. Because men just squirt from their weenie and that's it, right?  \n-Men can't match vibrators and sex toys for women, because they give the most instense orgasm. I have no reason not to believe this but I don't see why noone mentions this for the other side? That women can't match against men sex toys in giving pleasure? Why said researches never mentions guys with aneros sticked up their butt?\n\nI agree that average female orgasm is longer than male and that's it's easier for woman to have couple of orgasms during one intercourse (although there are some who never orgasmed...), but I don't believe it is more intense for them.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Originally the 2nd Amendment was more of a right for a Call to Arms (as I believe, with as much as I have read) which was largely changed in the early 1900's due to the National Guard.\n\nToday the 2nd Amendment is useless and only supports a military industrial complex. Let's say the original call to arms idiom was the \"Right to Bear Bombs\" and in the 20th century a National Bomb Association convinced a generation that having a bomb was your Right as per the constitution and for your safety. Surely bomb sales would go up and people would think that explosives were as much a right as firearms are now.\n\nBecause if you look at the very basic workings of a firearm, it is incredibly similar to an explosive. It's essentially a high-powered hole puncher, but on a much smaller and focused scale. Showing one off can incite terror and it allows for massive death in a very quick amount of time.\n\nFrom what I have talked about in the past, I honestly think that the only way my mind could be changed on this is if most gun owners were to agree to an actual revolution vs law enforcement. Or with law enforcement *and* gun owners (I'm sure there's a good bit of overlap there) were to fight the federal government. Since I'm VERY sure this will never happen, the 2nd amendment is self-defeating and allows for domestic terrorism (open carry, school shootings, 100,000 injuries a year including 30k deaths/suicides) and state fascism (Ferguson, Berkeley, NYPD, Cleveland, massive incarceration of blacks and plenty of police shootings that have gone unreported.)\n\n*Edit* Y'all have been unfriendly at best. I didn't ask to get my views changed on firearms, I asked to change my view regarding the 2nd Amendment. I've gotten messages claiming I'll never cmv and that I'm fake and I've been downvoted like crazy. I can't help but let that solidify my own view and most of you have failed as debaters. Rude, I know. But next time try not to blame mental illness for gun deaths with a guy who's been in a mental institution. Talk about rude, as if my own suicide attempt is simultaneously just like the Sandy Hook shooter and a catalyst for terrorism, but the two are still separate somehow. Just look at these replies, *many* of them are against my view and yet are hypocritical when compared to each other. The 2nd Amendment has nothing to do with fear, guns, government and yet has everything to do with fear, guns and government because that's what y'all keep talking about. I don't know guys, this has been a failure. Props to /u/grunt08 for actually being coherent if still jaded.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You're trying to tell me that the 2nd Amendment does not now completely support that ease of access for civilians to create immediate fear and death?\n\nWhat subsidies are you talking about?  I'm pretty sure you're just making that up, because the gun industry is profitable all on its own and has been for quite some time.  They're profitable because there is a large market for them to sell to.  That market exists because Americans like guns, which in turn means that they value the protection of their right to own them.  Put another way, why would the gun industry defend the 2nd Amendment if they couldn't make money by selling to a large number of people who also support the 2nd Amendment?\n\n&gt;Yes, please continue to debate the idea of the subject than the subject. That's definitely what I intended. Now who isn't open to critically assessing their view.\n\nThis sub does not exist for you to try and change my view.  If that's what you're going for, you need to read the sidebar again.\n\n&gt;The meaning of 'right to bear arms' was completely changed in 2008 in a landmark decision by the Supreme Court. This is the point I am making. The NRA used the conventional wisdom of 'bear arms' to mean 'bear firearms' and was successful in changing the meaning.\n\nYour understanding of *DC vs. Heller* is incorrect.  The 2nd Amendment has always been understood to reference firearms, the question was whether it endorsed firearms in the hands of individuals or in the collective hands of the people in the form of militias, law enforcement or the military.  That was the status of the Constitutional debate pre-*Heller*.\n\nThe major development of that case was that the court sided with those who argue for individual ownership.  The court did not introduce a meaning that had never been attributed to the Amendment, it did not make it refer to guns when it hadn't before and it did not \"completely change\" the meaning.  They sided with those who argued it had had the meaning it now legally has when it was initially written.\n\nTo further address your misunderstanding: if \"arms\" does not mean \"firearms\" (this is something nobody has seriously argued that I'm aware of), then it naturally takes on a more expansive definition, not an alternate one.  Saying \"arms\" does not mean \"firearms\" then implies that it refers to all weapons *including* firearms, not that it means slingshots or large rocks.\n\nSo I don't know where you got the idea that *Heller* \"changed\" the Amendment to mean firearms because that's just not what happened.  It was a question of who could own firearms, not what type of \"arms\" an individual could own.\n\n&gt;How is fear of the 19th deadliest death in America irrational?\n\nBecause it's extremely unlikely to ever harm you.  Again, cars are more dangerous.  I'm not afraid of a car until it looks like it's going to hit me, because it otherwise isn't going to hurt me.  I'm not afraid of a gun until it's pointed at me, because it otherwise isn't going to hurt me.  Those are rational reactions to things that are potentially dangerous but not inherently dangerous.\n\n&gt;A terrorist attack that was made possible with guns is still relevant to the 2nd Amendment since the 2nd Amendment now allows for the right to bear firearms. Talk about obfuscation. Political change is Amending Amendments, correct? So what are the Open Carriers attempting to do? Amend and amendment? Are they scaring people? I'm thinking it's incredibly close to domestic terrorism.\n\nSo basically anything having to do with guns is inherently related to the 2nd Amendment in your eyes?  *Do you not see how absurd that is?*  The Taliban is not acting in accordance with any US law anywhere in the United States.  Legislating based on what they do is like legislating politics as if every political party is a potential Nazi Party that must be quashed.\n\nOpen carriers are not trying to amend anything.  The point is that they are acting within their rights.  They're exercising what they already have, not demanding more.  And as I have said, their intent is not to scare or coerce anyone into anything.  Per the *correct* definition of terrorism, what they are doing is nowhere close to terrorism.  They may cause you anxiety, but your irrational fears are not their responsibility.\n\n&gt;You want to talk about Mental Illness, talk about Mental Illness, but don't you dare try to tell me that an American School Shooting like Sandy Hook is \"Mental Illness\" but the Pakistan School Shooting is \"terrorism.\" You are demonizing every single person who has to deal with mental illness just so you can evade the likenesses here for your own comfort of debate. Motive and intent? Looks like we're going to need a new word for Terrorism then since there seems to be loose motives, as what motive could shooting up a school ever be justified? Again, how is the Pakistan School Shooting Terrorism but not Mental Illness if it is Mental Illness? While Adam Lanza maybe didn't have a motive other than exercising his right to a firearm, it's still a result of major gun culture in America and there are MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY pro-gun arguers who are quick to turn the events of Sandy Hook into a political shitshow.\n\nI'll dare all I want and you can either address the argument or see yourself out if it's unbearable for you. I reasonably and rationally explained how Pakistan and Sandy Hook were different: the Taliban acted with deliberate purpose and with a political goal **in accordance with the actual definition of terrorism**.  They are in a running conflict with Pakistani authorities and to make a long story short, the attack on the school was intended as an act of revenge and a redemption of personal honor for the tribesmen of the Taliban.  Their intent was to intimidate and show their strength against a political enemy using tactics that were justifiable within their own set of values.  That's terrorism.\n\nAdam Lanza did what he did for no rational reason that I'm aware of.  He just murdered people because he could. \"Because guns\" is not a rational explanation, mental illness is.  He did something very irrational because his mind was dysfunctional.\n\nI'm not demonizing anybody; I'm indicating that a mental defect and lack of proper care led a person to do really fucked up things for no good reason.  Nor am I evading anything.  I'm explaining how a political assassin and serial killer are different because of motive and intent.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmyocfx", "body": "&gt;There's a difference?

That's definitely what I intended. Now who isn't open to critically assessing their view.\n\nThis sub does not exist for you to try and change my view.  If that's what you're going for, you need to read the sidebar again.\n\n&gt;The meaning of 'right to bear arms' was completely changed in 2008 in a landmark decision by the Supreme Court. This is the point I am making. The NRA used the conventional wisdom of 'bear arms' to mean 'bear firearms' and was successful in changing the meaning.\n\nYour understanding of *DC vs. Heller* is incorrect.  The 2nd Amendment has always been understood to reference firearms, the question was whether it endorsed firearms in the hands of individuals or in the collective hands of the people in the form of militias, law enforcement or the military.  That was the status of the Constitutional debate pre-*Heller*.\n\nThe major development of that case was that the court sided with those who argue for individual ownership.  The court did not introduce a meaning that had never been attributed to the Amendment, it did not make it refer to guns when it hadn't before and it did not \"completely change\" the meaning.  They sided with those who argued it had had the meaning it now legally has when it was initially written.\n\nTo further address your misunderstanding: if \"arms\" does not mean \"firearms\" (this is something nobody has seriously argued that I'm aware of), then it naturally takes on a more expansive definition, not an alternate one.  Saying \"arms\" does not mean \"firearms\" then implies that it refers to all weapons *including* firearms, not that it means slingshots or large rocks.\n\nSo I don't know where you got the idea that *Heller* \"changed\" the Amendment to mean firearms because that's just not what happened.  It was a question of who could own firearms, not what type of \"arms\" an individual could own.\n\n&gt;How is fear of the 19th deadliest death in America irrational?\n\nBecause it's extremely unlikely to ever harm you.  Again, cars are more dangerous.  I'm not afraid of a car until it looks like it's going to hit me, because it otherwise isn't going to hurt me.  I'm not afraid of a gun until it's pointed at me, because it otherwise isn't going to hurt me.  Those are rational reactions to things that are potentially dangerous but not inherently dangerous.\n\n&gt;A terrorist attack that was made possible with guns is still relevant to the 2nd Amendment since the 2nd Amendment now allows for the right to bear firearms. Talk about obfuscation. Political change is Amending Amendments, correct? So what are the Open Carriers attempting to do? Amend and amendment? Are they scaring people? I'm thinking it's incredibly close to domestic terrorism.\n\nSo basically anything having to do with guns is inherently related to the 2nd Amendment in your eyes?  *Do you not see how absurd that is?*  The Taliban is not acting in accordance with any US law anywhere in the United States.  Legislating based on what they do is like legislating politics as if every political party is a potential Nazi Party that must be quashed.\n\nOpen carriers are not trying to amend anything.  The point is that they are acting within their rights.  They're exercising what they already have, not demanding more.  And as I have said, their intent is not to scare or coerce anyone into anything.  Per the *correct* definition of terrorism, what they are doing is nowhere close to terrorism.  They may cause you anxiety, but your irrational fears are not their responsibility.\n\n&gt;You want to talk about Mental Illness, talk about Mental Illness, but don't you dare try to tell me that an American School Shooting like Sandy Hook is \"Mental Illness\" but the Pakistan School Shooting is \"terrorism.\" You are demonizing every single person who has to deal with mental illness just so you can evade the likenesses here for your own comfort of debate. Motive and intent? Looks like we're going to need a new word for Terrorism then since there seems to be loose motives, as what motive could shooting up a school ever be justified? Again, how is the Pakistan School Shooting Terrorism but not Mental Illness if it is Mental Illness? While Adam Lanza maybe didn't have a motive other than exercising his right to a firearm, it's still a result of major gun culture in America and there are MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY pro-gun arguers who are quick to turn the events of Sandy Hook into a political shitshow.\n\nI'll dare all I want and you can either address the argument or see yourself out if it's unbearable for you. I reasonably and rationally explained how Pakistan and Sandy Hook were different: the Taliban acted with deliberate purpose and with a political goal **in accordance with the actual definition of terrorism**.  They are in a running conflict with Pakistani authorities and to make a long story short, the attack on the school was intended as an act of revenge and a redemption of personal honor for the tribesmen of the Taliban.  Their intent was to intimidate and show their strength against a political enemy using tactics that were justifiable within their own set of values.  That's terrorism.\n\nAdam Lanza did what he did for no rational reason that I'm aware of.  He just murdered people because he could. \"Because guns\" is not a rational explanation, mental illness is.  He did something very irrational because his mind was dysfunctional.\n\nI'm not demonizing anybody; I'm indicating that a mental defect and lack of proper care led a person to do really fucked up things for no good reason.  Nor am I evading anything.  I'm explaining how a political assassin and serial killer are different because of motive and intent.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmzbfy7", "body": "Ha!

The obvious reason the original idiom was not the \"Right to Bear Bombs\" is that they were referring broadly to military weapons, the most common being firearms. They used the word that referred to what they were talking about instead of a word that did not refer to what they were talking about.\n\nDo you understand what analogies are? They are not made to be taken literally, but only to show you how similar competing ideas can be; in this case it is that the meaning has been changed in order to support the firearm industry. I don't think it's that hard to imagine an America where the idiom had been something else like right to bear swords, but swords at the time meant weapons, but a savvy Sword Association took advantage of the wordplay in order to ultimately change the 2nd Amendment to also protect your right to own a Sword.

Many are explicitly trying to do the opposite: to acclimate others to the presence of guns so they won't fear them.\nSchool shootings are arguably a form of terrorism, but they generally aren't acts of political terrorism. They're expressions of mental illness.\nAccidents that result in injury or death cannot possibly be termed terrorism while using the word accurately.\n\nMy last comment still stands. Just because you are not afraid does not mean that the general public is not terrorised by these things. And you don't think the latest Pakistan School Shooting is terrorism? Or Sandy Hook? Really? And ask the victims' families how they felt after dealing with gun deaths and injuries. It's not happiness, that's for sure.\n\n&gt; How is the 2nd Amendment creating these things?

Why is there a civilian protection to ensure a right to own a gun on par with the right to vote for women? \n\nAnd why is either on par with the right to not have soldiers sleep in your living room?  \n\nThe 2nd amendment exists because the government of Great Britain had gone around seizing the guns of colonial militias.  \n\nThe 3rd amendment exists because the government of Great Britain had forced people to let soldiers be quartered in their homes.  \n\nThe 4th amendment exists because the government of Great Britain had given officers \"writs of assistance\" which let them search anyone's home whenever they pleased.  \n\nThe 5th amendment protects the right to not \"be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law\" because the government of Great Britain had been changing the rules of trials and justice after the fact in many cases.  \n\nThe 6th amendment protects the right to a trial in the state and jurisdiction where the crime took place, because Great Britain had been shipping people accused of crimes back to Great Britain for trial, instead of trying them in the colonies.\n\nThe point of this is that the second amendment, like a lot of the bill of rights, seeks to limit the power of government in ways that were pressing at the time of the revolutionary war.  Some of these are still pressing today (right against unreasonable searches).  Some are not (right against quartering soldiers).\n\nIn the case of the right to bear arms, the right basically means the government can't ban ownership of guns or go around seizing guns en masse.

Why is there a civilian protection to ensure a right to own a gun on par with the right to vote for women? \n\nAnd why is either on par with the right to not have soldiers sleep in your living room?  \n\nThe 2nd amendment exists because the government of Great Britain had gone around seizing the guns of colonial militias.  \n\nThe 3rd amendment exists because the government of Great Britain had forced people to let soldiers be quartered in their homes.  \n\nThe 4th amendment exists because the government of Great Britain had given officers \"writs of assistance\" which let them search anyone's home whenever they pleased.  \n\nThe 5th amendment protects the right to not \"be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law\" because the government of Great Britain had been changing the rules of trials and justice after the fact in many cases.  \n\nThe 6th amendment protects the right to a trial in the state and jurisdiction where the crime took place, because Great Britain had been shipping people accused of crimes back to Great Britain for trial, instead of trying them in the colonies.\n\nThe point of this is that the second amendment, like a lot of the bill of rights, seeks to limit the power of government in ways that were pressing at the time of the revolutionary war.

"}, {"id": "2pnx6e", "body": "In 2008 the Supreme Court decided that the Right to Bear Arms means a right to a firearm and yet there is no right to food, housing, internet, education or other items needed to survive. Originally the 2nd Amendment was more of a right for a Call to Arms (as I believe, with as much as I have read) which was largely changed in the early 1900's due to the National Guard.\n\nToday the 2nd Amendment is useless and only supports a military industrial complex. Let's say the original call to arms idiom was the \"Right to Bear Bombs\" and in the 20th century a National Bomb Association convinced a generation that having a bomb was your Right as per the constitution and for your safety. Surely bomb sales would go up and people would think that explosives were as much a right as firearms are now.\n\nBecause if you look at the very basic workings of a firearm, it is incredibly similar to an explosive. It's essentially a high-powered hole puncher, but on a much smaller and focused scale. Showing one off can incite terror and it allows for massive death in a very quick amount of time.\n\nFrom what I have talked about in the past, I honestly think that the only way my mind could be changed on this is if most gun owners were to agree to an actual revolution vs law enforcement. Or with law enforcement *and* gun owners (I'm sure there's a good bit of overlap there) were to fight the federal government. Since I'm VERY sure this will never happen, the 2nd amendment is self-defeating and allows for domestic terrorism (open carry, school shootings, 100,000 injuries a year including 30k deaths/suicides) and state fascism (Ferguson, Berkeley, NYPD, Cleveland, massive incarceration of blacks and plenty of police shootings that have gone unreported.)\n\n*Edit* Y'all have been unfriendly at best. I didn't ask to get my views changed on firearms, I asked to change my view regarding the 2nd Amendment. I've gotten messages claiming I'll never cmv and that I'm fake and I've been downvoted like crazy. I can't help but let that solidify my own view and most of you have failed as debaters. Rude, I know. But next time try not to blame mental illness for gun deaths with a guy who's been in a mental institution. Talk about rude, as if my own suicide attempt is simultaneously just like the Sandy Hook shooter and a catalyst for terrorism, but the two are still separate somehow. Just look at these replies, *many* of them are against my view and yet are hypocritical when compared to each other. The 2nd Amendment has nothing to do with fear, guns, government and yet has everything to do with fear, guns and government because that's what y'all keep talking about. I don't know guys, this has been a failure. Props to /u/grunt08 for actually being coherent if still jaded.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Instead, rapists may target just the opposite, people who are dress conservatively, because they view them as easier targets. While people perceive dress to have an impact on who is assaulted, studies of rapists suggest that victim attire is not a significant factor. Instead, rapists look for signs of passiveness and submissiveness, which, studies suggest, are more likely to coincide with more body-concealing clothing.\n\n&gt;In a study to test whether males could determine whether women were high or low in passiveness and submissiveness, Richards and her colleagues found that men, using only nonverbal appearance cues, could accurately assess which women were passive and submissive versus those who were dominant and assertive.\n\n&gt;Clothing was one of the key cues: \u201cThose females high in passivity and submissiveness (i.e., those at greatest risk for victimization) wore noticeably more body-concealing clothing (i.e., high necklines, long pants and sleeves, multiple layers).\u201d This suggests that men equate body-concealing clothing with passive and submissive qualities, which are qualities that rapists look for in victims.

There are consequences for the choices she made. When you wear revealing clothing, you are to blame when you get cold that night, or you have a wardrobe malfunction. When you go to a bar and get drunk, you are to blame for the hangover you have the next day and making a fool of yourself. Those are the consequences of those actions. Rape is not. It seems like you might disagree with this based on you saying she should've known what to expect, but that's just not backed up by statistics. \n\nStatistics on rape in America show that over [40% of female survivors were first raped before the age of 18](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf). Considering that the legal drinking age in America is 21, I think it's safe to assume that a majority of those cases did not occur in or due to bars. Furthermore, the majority of rape/sexual assault incidents occur within one mile of the victim's home, or at their home-- [6/10 cases occur either in the victim's home, or the home or a friend, neighbor, or relative.](https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders)\n\nWhen you talk about what she should have expected, it's simply not factoring in the realities of sexual violence. When you make the argument that women should consider the likelihood of rape in their decision-making, you're making an argument that women should not have partners or stay in their own home because these are more prevalent circumstances surrounding rape than being drunk at a bar. \n\nYou mentioned in other comments that you don't view all men as beasts at the mercy of their sexual drive, but rather that men guilty of rape are people who are outside normal male psychology. I'm not sure if I completely agree with that, but I think it does speak to the fact that when we think about rape, we run it through our own understanding of the world. When we try to understand why people rape, I think there's a tendency to associate it with sexual desire because that's something we understand. That leads to assumptions like yours, that acting in a blatantly sexual way increases the likelihood that a woman will be raped. But that's just not the picture presented by any data I've ever come into contact with. \n\nIf you believe that a survivor of rape can share blame for their assault by putting themselves in dangerous situations, I'd urge you to look more into which situations are actually the most dangerous-- being a friend, being a relative, being young-- and ask yourself if you'd feel comfortable with a world where women can be blamed for their own rape simply for having friends or being around older family members.\n"}, {"id": "2pnpq4", "body": "I live in a relatively conservative country.

There are risks in this world, it's unavoidable since we don't live in a utopia. If you make risky decisions and they backfire on you, you can only blame yourself - but this moral, personal type of blame has nothing to do with criminal responsibility. Let me use your analogy to illustrate this.\n\nIf you're an investment banker and meet a nice girl in a library, get her number, date her for a couple of months, and then get drugged and \"child support frauded\" out of the blue you can not blame yourself. On the other hand if you meet a known gold digger who already collects child support from two wealthy guys, and your friends warn you that a similar thing might happen to you, but you still put your neck in the hook, you're a freakin' dumbass who can only blame himself for his ordeal.\n\nSimilarly, if you sit at home watching TV when a robber breaks into your house and decides to rape you, you have 0% criminal responsibility and 0% personal blame. But if *you decide* to wonder around the most dangerous part of town half naked and shitfaced at night alone, you are making a very bad decision which you can be blamed for, since it was something stupid that *you did*. If you get raped there you still have 0% criminal responsibility, but you have actively participated in creating the circumstances leading to your victimization, so a certain part of the personal blame is yours.\n\nIf the *\"should have known better\"* argument is applicable is entirely dependent on the circumstances.\n\nYou do seem like an intelligent person so let me ask you this: by attacking the police for its preventive measures on rape and organizing slut walks demanding that no man rapes a woman ever, do not feminists demand a utopia built by men? You can't just teach people not to kill, not to hurt others, or not to rape. It's not a question of public awareness campaigns, since there is a ~1% criminal element out there who will never care about campaigns against anything. These are violent people who will commit murder and even torture, and you think it's a good idea to try appealing to their kindliness by asking them not to rape women??? This is lunacy, literally, and I do mean literally. \"Teach men not to rape\" is the stupidest idea ever because men are already taught not rape, thank you very much, but the aforementioned 1% do not give a shit. They know that rape is bad, how on earth could they not know, but they simply don't care. And feminists demand that we do not teach women to protect themselves from these psychopaths, instead placing the fate of women in the hands of these very psychopaths asking them to be nice guys.\n\nIf we could only teach mass murderers not to mass murder, all mass murders would go away...

There are a number of issues with this that have been addressed in other posts. For the purposes of this post, let's assume we're talking about a rapist who is unknown to the victim (as you've alluded to elsewhere in making comments about your coworker staying out late and being alone) and who fits the general \"hiding in a dark alley\" stereotype, as that seems to be what you're driving at.\n\nAs it turns out, there is some literature to suggest that the popular notion that \"immodest dress invites rape\" might be true. [Instead, rapists may target just the opposite](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=djglp), people who are dress conservatively, because they view them as easier targets.\n\n&gt;While people perceive dress to have an impact on who is assaulted, studies of rapists suggest that victim attire is not a significant factor. **Instead, rapists look for signs of passiveness and submissiveness, which, studies suggest, are more likely to coincide with more body-concealing clothing.**\n\n&gt;In a study to test whether males could determine whether women were high or low in passiveness and submissiveness, Richards and her colleagues found that men, using only nonverbal appearance cues, could accurately assess which women were passive and submissive versus those who were dominant and assertive.\n\n&gt;Clothing was one of the key cues: \u201cThose females high in passivity and \nsubmissiveness (i.e., those at greatest risk for victimization) wore noticeably more body-concealing clothing (i.e., high necklines, long pants and sleeves, multiple layers).\u201d This suggests that men equate body-concealing clothing with passive and submissive qualities, which are qualities that rapists look for in victims. Thus, those who wore provocative clothes would not be viewed as passive or submissive, and would be less likely to be victims of assault.\n\nSo, effectively, the general public is pretty good at picking up on social cues to tell if someone is passive, and one of the ways that we as a society indicate that is by how we dress. Everyone does this (as well as determines a lot of other things about strangers by how they look). \n\nIt stands to reason, then, that the very, very small subset of the general public that comprises the \"dark alley rapist\" trope are *also* probably pretty good at figuring out whether someone is passive by their clothing, and that they may be more likely to attack people who they perceive as submissive or passive. And so, they might be likely to attack someone wearing body-concealing clothing because they're less likely to fight back or cry out for help. \n\nIf that's the case, or even if that's the case only for the dark alley rapist but *isn't* true for someone who is known to the victim, then the implication is that it's sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't.

There's been a lot of debate over whether a victim can ever be blamed no matter what risks he or she takes, and I agree with that to some extent.  But even if you don't agree, I don't think your friend took an unreasonable risk.\n\nLook, life is all about taking big risks.  We all risk our lives every day.  I get up in the morning and take the freeway to work, knowing that a drunk driver could easily ram into my car and kill me.  Sometimes there's ice outside and I leave the house anyway, knowing that I could slip and fall and break my bones.  In the winter I visit my family for Christmas, which is a five hour drive.  That's five hours of winter driving where I could easily get in a bad car accident.  I don't even need to visit family.  I just like to.  I also eat steak, which some experts claim might increase the likelihood of cancer.  I like steak, so I still eat it, even though I really don't want cancer.  There are some huge risks associated with most things that people do, but we do them anyway and most of the time we're fine.  You're friend has the right to take risks as well.  Going to seedy bars carries some risk, but she'll most likely be fine and it's clear that it's something she enjoys.  \n\nNow, there are simple ways of preventing risks that are all fine.  My car has an airbag, I lock my door at night and when I leave my house, etc, but these are all simple things.  Most cars have safety features.  Putting on a seat belt, or locking my apartment door takes two seconds and doesn't interfere with my life in any significant way, so it's easy to say that I should do those things.  Saying that I shouldn't drive on freeways, for example, or shouldn't ever leave the house, isn't really as easy.  That's not a reasonable precaution to take, because I enjoy leaving the house, even for unnecessary things, and driving on the freeway frees up a lot of my time.  The cost to my quality of life isn't worth the little bit of risk prevention I'd gain, even if the risk is my life.  If a crazed drunk driver were to hit me, or if my apartment window was shattered and my possessions stolen, It wouldn't be my fault.  I think we can all agree that leaving the house and driving around is a pretty reasonable thing to \n\nAnother point, statistics and psychologists have shown that dressing provocatively doesn't actually increase your chances of being raped.  Maybe hanging around higher crime areas might, but that would only increase the risk to a point, and depending on how much she enjoys doing the things she does, it might be worth the risk.\n\nIf she dressed modestly and stayed inside all day, and never did anything she loved or dated or socialized or anything, and took every possible precaution for avoiding rape, she'd be miserable.  And it's still possible she'd get raped anyway.  \n\nMy point is that in order to live a full life, you have to take some chances, and you shouldn't fault people for taking small risks to do the things that they love.

You have a problem with her \"making a situation\" where a rapist cannot control themselves.

This place is dangerous!\".\n\nPeople have to be responsible for their actions.

Would-Be-Rapists are the ones that break the law and they are the ones that ultimately make the decision.\n\nNot to mention, studies have shown that they tend to attack people who wear *less* provocative outfits because they are the \"easier\" targets.

Choice can be a weird thing. Sometimes you can be completely fine with a situation so long as you have no choice in it, but if you are given a choice, it can actually seem like a worse situation. For someone who is sentenced to life without parole, eventually I'm sure that most of them just easily accept that they will never be free. They'll never have the choices in life that they once had again, they just accept it and it's not part of their mind. That's how we adapt to survive that kind of situation. \n\nIf you gave this person a sentence of 20 years and then they get to choose whether or not they want out of prison, that has a lot of different dynamics to it. They accept only that they won't have choices for 20 years. Even if like the OP for example, you seem to believe he'd change his mind, which is entirely possible. That's the last choice he could ever have, but it's not the last time he could ever just remain locked up in prison. It's easy for our brains to trick us into taking the choice because we cling to the ideals and hopes even if they're basically impossible, and in that situation someone would know they could just commit another crime and go back to prison if they give up on choice again. Even if they don't consciously realize it, the inability to cope with choice manifests itself into chaotic or destructive behavior that ultimately solves the issue for them by getting them locked up and removing the ability to choose. \n\nIf you believe these possibilities as I've just described them, which the OP might, then I think it's entirely believable that someone could at least in that mindset, choose to remove choice ahead of time. If I really truly believed that after 20 years of prison life I wouldn't be capable of functioning in society, then I would without a doubt just take life in prison, because I have no doubt that I'd just end up back in prison. If I committed a crime in the first place, I probably wasn't coping all that well with life in society anyhow, and I'm not going to be better off after that. It would be better off than teasing myself at the 20 year mark, letting myself believe in that choice of hope that I could make something better, when I can look at all the factors ahead of time and see that it would be near impossible."}, {"id": "2pnm9s", "body": "I've been angry about the setup of the US penal system for a long time for being a system of punishment instead of rehabilitation.

I really haven't seen many arguments for keeping the embargo that I thought carried much weight, and certainly not to the extent of being much of a counterbalance.  \n\nThere's really not a great deal of sense in continuing to isolate Cuba.  The Cold War is long past--and even if it weren't, shifting relations with a previously-hostile country towards neutral or friendly ground would be a positive step.  The sanctions also utterly failed to force out, or even come close to forcing out, the communist government there--the worst that could come from normalization is a continuation of the status quo, and as a trade partner, America would have more influence over Cuba, not less.  While some conservatives have been squawking that this move makes it look like America \"lacks resolve,\" it would seem to me that, given the fluid nature of the world situation these days, it makes much more sense to be willing to make good-faith deals where possible than to keep to traditional allies and enemies purely for tradition's sake.  \n\nAs for the human rights situation (in as much as the US government cares about human rights beyond handing out the occasional brow-beating), I frankly don't see that changing much without a deeper change in Cuban society and government, but life there will probably be made better by a trade deal, not worse.  The American society and economy will likely benefit, too, but given the orders of magnitude in difference between the countries, that will be a much smaller effect.\n\nSo what's left after that?

I appreciate the subtle tricks directors throw in here and there to tilt the angle of the audience's perception of the scene. This is the beauty of the art of film-making.

People never have an accurate critique on whether the movie was \"good\" or \"bad\". I believe their decision of the movie's goodness is based on things unrelated to the movie itself such as preset confirmation bias due to certain actors or directors associated with the film, confirmation bias due to a friend's 'review', group think, or even intruding mood. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
