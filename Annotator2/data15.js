The way hockey works, a primary assist may be more instrumental in the goal than the actual goal itself, an example would be hitting someone with a shot that goes in - the person who took the shot would receive and assist and the person who got hit would receive the goal. Sometimes the secondary assist is actually the driving force behind the goal.\n\nAnd studies have been done to compare secondary assists to primaries, and for the most part it's the same across the board. If you removed all secondary assists, the great players would still be in the same order in lists of points. \n\nAnd in Gretzky's case I doubt it matters, because he has the most goals, and probably the most primary and secondary stats. \n\nIt is worth noting, however, that Gretzky played in an era with slightly higher scoring. Goaltending wasn't was it is today and more points were scored in his era than today.

I believe that vegetarianism has never been conclusively shown to be detrimental to ones own health. Every necessary nutrient can be consumed in these diets. Pure veganism would be bad without B12 supplementation (and possibly creatine/iron/protein although not as much), but vegan B12 supplements exist. I don't think that vegetarianism/veganism is healthier than an omnivore diet, but rather that both are sustainable by humans.\n\nThis point is related to the evolution argument. I don't think that humans require a omnivorous diet. Humans probably evolved from a mostly frugivorous creature, but perhaps evolved to eat meat with a major deforestation event that caused their territory to become more savannah-like. I think they evolved to eat meat because of a lack of plant resources, and probably only ate meat on occasion. Canines are often brought up in relation to this point, but it is important to note that our canines are significantly reduced compared to our fruigvorous relatives (e.g. the orangutan) and that canine size in apes was probably a result of some process of sexual selection (evidenced in part by the vast sexual dimorphism).\n\nMoving on to the ethics, I think that killing many animals is wrong. I do draw a line, however, between different kinds of animals - a subtlety that I think is important albeit somewhat neglected.

I believe that vegetarianism has never been conclusively shown to be detrimental to ones own health. Every necessary nutrient can be consumed in these diets. Pure veganism would be bad without B12 supplementation (and possibly creatine/iron/protein although not as much), but vegan B12 supplements exist. I don't think that vegetarianism/veganism is healthier than an omnivore diet, but rather that both are sustainable by humans.\n\nThis point is related to the evolution argument. I don't think that humans require a omnivorous diet. Humans probably evolved from a mostly frugivorous creature, but perhaps evolved to eat meat with a major deforestation event that caused their territory to become more savannah-like. I think they evolved to eat meat because of a lack of plant resources, and probably only ate meat on occasion. Canines are often brought up in relation to this point, but it is important to note that our canines are significantly reduced compared to our fruigvorous relatives (e.g. the orangutan) and that canine size in apes was probably a result of some process of sexual selection (evidenced in part by the vast sexual dimorphism).\n\nMoving on to the ethics, I think that killing many animals is wrong. I do draw a line, however, between different kinds of animals - a subtlety that I think is important albeit somewhat neglected. I think killing anything that can have emotion or conception of self is wrong. It is hard to say what animals can have these things, but it is reasonable to believe that many mammals can. I reject the idea that emotions or consciousness is only (or even most) realized in humankind.\n\nI do not think that killing anything without a brain is wrong. Therefore, I cannot care for jellyfish, sea urchins, or most mollusks, which all lack a CNS, and think that eating them is fine (even while they are still alive, as is sometimes done in parts of Japan with sea urchins-or uni). I generally think that eating insects is also fine, as their nervous system never completely centralized and I don't believe their supraesophageal ganglion is capable of understanding itself. The insect is clearly not capable of emotion or pain as we conceive of it, as it still attempts complex behavior (e.g. mating) even if its legs are chopped off.\n\nI start to have problems with chordates. I'm not sure what to think of fish, birds, and reptiles. Their brain is very similar to ours, and although their telencephala are very small, they have beginnings of a limbic system, and respond to pain in a broad sense, shutting down complex behavior and learning from it. I'm not sure whether their response is complex enough to be called pain (this is debatable for some of these creatures). Mammal brains are too complex for me to justify eating, especially those that we typically consume, such as cows and pigs (cows, for example, experience depression and commit suicide).\n\nTo summarize, my major argument is that consumption of many of the animals (esp. mammals) we typically consume is wrong.

A dissatisfied customer was a pressured situation and I had to involve several coworkers who were all time crunched and it was awful. The demands on me now I'm much more in control of and can prioritize tasks much easier. I actually made more hourly at the restaurant than I do here, but I choose this office job because it's easier and fits in my lifestyle. \n\nOh yeah, lifestyle of service jobs is miserable too, at least for me.

I think that one of the reasons beverage companies use caffeine in many drinks is to get people hooked on that beverage. Many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep. Caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine. Overall I think adding the content will help because it subliminaly shows people that caffeine is a drug and should be treated like it while increasing consumer awareness and choice while also not discouraging or inconvenienceing anyone who chooses to use caffeine.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In order to require displaying dosage of a given product, it seems to me we need one or more of the following cases:\n\n1. It is very easy to unknowingly do significant harm in the short-term simply by not knowing the dosage. (This includes incapacitation, death, sickness, permanent damage, etc.)\n\n2.

For #1, people can get drunk, incapacitated, alcohol poisoning, and even die from too much alcohol too fast, and many of these are not uncommon. Sometimes it is intentional or negligent, but it also happens from not knowing how much alcohol is in the drink which then reduces your ability to judge whether you should have another drink. For #2, alcoholism, liver damage, and other long-term health effects result from drinking too much alcohol over the long term, even if you never binge-drink.

For #1, it's next to impossible to overdose on caffeine in the amounts that come in consumer products. At about 300 mg (2-3 large cups of coffee or large-can energy drinks) on the order of a few hours, you might get the jitters. A [lethal dose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_caffeine) is about 80-100 cups of coffee (or energy drinks) over a relatively short time period. Serious short-term effects only really start showing up around 1000 mg (1 g), or about 8-10 cups or drinks, and that might be convulsions and vomiting, which mostly clears it out of your system.\n\nThere appear to be no long-term negative health effects of regular consumption of caffeine, even at the high end of \"regular\". (See above link.) Yes, you can become addicted to it and suffer withdrawals, but that manifests mostly as a tolerance to it and some excess tiredness for a few weeks. No significant harms.\n\nI'm unaware of any significant social costs that caffeine is causing us, other than the lost productivity of people waiting in line at coffee shops.\n\nWhat are these harms you think need addressing?

Some of these are insomnia (not just because you consumed it but has a neurological change that causes it), high blood pressure, heart problems, hypertension, and possibly linked to other health issues such as accelerate bone loss and irregular heartbeat. Also many Americans are addicted to caffeine without knowing it or do not understand the full extent of their addiction. Caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches, irritability, constipation, and others. While products with caffeine lack many of the other harmful chemicals found in nicotine products, caffeine and nicotine are very similar drugs but doesn't get nearly the same attention by society as far as addiction goes.

Clearly it's not as bad as alcohol and not needed to calculate a \"safe\" dose in the case of caffeine but cleaclearly labeling the caffeine content will allow people to see how much caffeine they ingest at a glance. Many people are not aware of how much caffeine is in soda and often get addicted to caffeine without realizing it is happeneing. I think that one of the reasons beverage companies use caffeine in many drinks is to get people hooked on that beverage. Many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep. Caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine. Overall I think adding the content will help because it subliminaly shows people that caffeine is a drug and should be treated like it while increasing consumer awareness and choice while also not discouraging or inconvenienceing anyone who chooses to use caffeine.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
