Price point. While you mention leasing options as low as $199/mo, I'm skeptical that a majority of Americans are comfortable leasing their vehicles. With MSRP in the mid $30,000's, most average middle class families would not find it worth the investment, especially given the high cost of replacement parts and repairs. \n\n2. Car culture. The fact remains that electric cars have not entered the mainstream just yet. They're growing every year, and this is a good thing, but in 2014, electric charging stations are not abundant, the ranges of electric cars are not incredible enough to turn enough heads, and the design of these cars are not yet appealing to the mainstream.\n\nThere simply aren't enough justifications for an average middle class American family to purchase a Chevy Volt, or any electric car for that matter, when they can purchase a Honda Accord with more space, excellent gas mileage, a sleek design, and relatively reasonable replacement/maintenance costs. \n\nI will love the year when electric cars finally become mainstream, but 2014/2015 is not that year. \n\n"}, {"id": "2orjn9", "body": "Disclaimer: I leased a Volt about 7 months ago and love it.

(This happened once in a crash test, traditional gas-engine cars ignite more often than electric)\n* Your electricity goes through the roof! (it costs me less than $20/month to charge the car at home)\n* Electric cars are only for rich people! (I've seen some leases starting at $199/month)\n* It's expensive to maintain! \n* Obama forced GM to build this! (It was first developed in 2006 and the EV tax credits were put in place by George W. Bush)\n\nIt's a very acclaimed car - it's won the most prestigious industry awards, including Motor Trend Car of the Year.  Kelly Blue Book rates it with the lowest projected costs during initial five-year ownership period. \n\nDrivers love it too. The Volt ranked first, for a second year in a row, in Consumer Reports' list of owner-satisfaction based on its 2012 Annual Auto Survey, with 92% respondents who owned the Volt saying they definitely would purchase that same vehicle again. \n\nThe first generation of this car is now at it's end, and there's tons of data available that show just how game-changing this car is for the average driver. If you can convince me that all of this won't get more Volts on the road, a delta is yours.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nEDIT: Thanks for the time today. This slowly morphed from \"GM's Marketing Department sucks because....\" to \"The Volt sucks because....\" and \"Actually the Volt doesn't suck because....\" \n\nIn the end, I was convinced that no amount of marketing can end the amount of political football that the Volt was unfortunately roped into. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'd accept your argument were we talking about the Leaf or other full EV, but a 30% degraded Volt battery is really no big deal. In fact the Volt is still perfectly usable even if its battery has degraded 50% or more. Of course it'd be no fun to have to buy gas and/or charge midday a little more frequently, but you can still get around on gas power if need be.\n\nAlso, GM heavily over-engineered the Volt battery to maximize longevity. It's a nominally 16 kWh battery with only about 11 kWh usable, which means it'd have to degrade about 30% before you'd even notice a drop in range, and that limited depth-of-discharge along with an active cooling system ensures that it won't degrade that fast."}, {"id": "cmpua9x", "body": "The battery is covered by an 8 year warranty.

A lot of people don't really care about gas mileage that much, which is why they use SUV's as commuter cars.\n\n2. Most people who buy new cars have a two-car household, which means they could have one gas car for long drives and a smaller electric car like the Chevy Spark EV for commuting.\n\n3. It's more expensive than similar cars, even after the tax credit. A lot of people would rather save money now even if it costs them more in the long run (hence why people finance new cars in the first place).\n\n4. People don't like change. The Chevy Volt is new and scary, they'd rather wait until it's more widely used.\n\n5. No matter how good Chevy's marketing is, people are still going to believe those fire rumors.\n\n6. I remember seeing a study a while back that showed that conservatives were less likely to buy light bulbs if they were advertised as saving the environment, even if it saved them money.

That puts the minimum annual income to purchase a Volt at $33K per year, right at the 40th percentile for US households. In other words, you must be at least middle-class in order to afford one. \n\nIn that market, the vehicle's biggest selling points (mileage and cost of ownership) takes a back seat to other features like, well... the back seat. Middle and upper-class consumers are more concerned with seating, comfort, storage, and prestige.

I tried to explain my position as clearly as I could, and in cases like that, my writing tends to take a decidedly formal swerve. I'm aware that this carefully formal style may make me sound smug, pompous, or whatever other adjectives of oblivious self-inflation may apply. If anything I write strikes you that way, I'm sorry. I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone, rather than from condescension.)\n___\n\n##Background\n\nThis topic is on my mind because it's apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkin's *The Newsroom*, and I just read in today's New York Times an [article about the controversy that episode aroused](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/arts/television/hbos-the-newsroom-draws-backlash-over-rape-plot.html). It seems the episode involved a credible, empathetic accuser and a \"sketchy\", offscreen accused, so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so, a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience, without any conviction or trial.\n\nThis seems to have aroused a huge backlash, with articles published [on Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/a-terrible-episode-with-worse-timing-the-newsroom-tack-1668181204) and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to \"victim-blame a woman who was raped\"\u2014despite the fact, that, as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article, he *created* this character to be a sympathetic *alleged* rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.\n\nAnother quotation from the NYT article:\n\n&gt;Emily Nussbaum, the TV critic for The New Yorker, wrote of the producer character: \u201c**He argues that the idealistic thing to do is not to believe her story.**\u201d\n\n___\n##Presentation of my views\n\nIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one's story\" with \"disbelieving one's story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite\u2014but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something, and I don't have a good reason to believe one or the other, my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life, but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.\n\nMoreover, I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed, uncorroborated things, and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason, I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.\n\nFurthermore, even if, for argument's sake, one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true, I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sort\u2014*viz.*, \"innocent until proven guilty\"\u2014would remain vitally important, because its abrogation in *any* case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone else's life, while facing little or no potential negative impact him- or herself.\n___\n##Summary of my views\n\nThe views I'm asking you to change, if you can, are:\n\n1. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore, assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.\n\n2. The protocol of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth (how could it be?) but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such, it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.\n\n3. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third, most important possibility of all, which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.\n\n_____\n\n##My biases\n\nI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level (an INTP personality type, if you like [the Myers-Briggs categorization system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)). Furthermore, I'm a man and do not personally know any rape victims that I'm aware of, so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level (which of course I do, too) I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation (the position I can more readily imagine myself in) than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.\n\nI'm aware of both these biases, and of course, like everything else in our world of matter and men, my views are also subject to Newton's First Law, which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.\n\n___\n\n##And so...\nwith those caveats in mind, change my views please, if you will: any or all of them. Even if you don't succeed in changing them entirely, I'll welcome any added perspective you can provide me, and I believe I'm open to that much at the very least.\n\n____\n\n##PS: Support roles\n\nA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of (ideally) neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a person's support system (immediate family and close friends), suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral, but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. I'd tentatively agree with that, with the proviso that I'd apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim (of rape or of slander). I'd add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when they're not acting on those beliefs in a way that's liable to directly cause harm to someone else.\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone, rather than from condescension.)\n___\n\n##Background\n\nThis topic is on my mind because it's apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkin's *The Newsroom*, and I just read in today's New York Times an [article about the controversy that episode aroused](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/arts/television/hbos-the-newsroom-draws-backlash-over-rape-plot.html). It seems the episode involved a credible, empathetic accuser and a \"sketchy\", offscreen accused, so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so, a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience, without any conviction or trial.\n\nThis seems to have aroused a huge backlash, with articles published [on Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/a-terrible-episode-with-worse-timing-the-newsroom-tack-1668181204) and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to \"victim-blame a woman who was raped\"\u2014despite the fact, that, as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article, he *created* this character to be a sympathetic *alleged* rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.\n\nAnother quotation from the NYT article:\n\n&gt;Emily Nussbaum, the TV critic for The New Yorker, wrote of the producer character: \u201c**He argues that the idealistic thing to do is not to believe her story.**\u201d\n\n___\n##Presentation of my views\n\nIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one's story\" with \"disbelieving one's story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite\u2014but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something, and I don't have a good reason to believe one or the other, my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life, but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.\n\nMoreover, I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed, uncorroborated things, and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason, I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.\n\nFurthermore, even if, for argument's sake, one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true, I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sort\u2014*viz.*, \"innocent until proven guilty\"\u2014would remain vitally important, because its abrogation in *any* case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone else's life, while facing little or no potential negative impact him- or herself.\n___\n##Summary of my views\n\nThe views I'm asking you to change, if you can, are:\n\n1. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore, assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.\n\n2. The protocol of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth (how could it be?) but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such, it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.\n\n3. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third, most important possibility of all, which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.\n\n_____\n\n##My biases\n\nI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level (an INTP personality type, if you like [the Myers-Briggs categorization system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)). Furthermore, I'm a man and do not personally know any rape victims that I'm aware of, so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level (which of course I do, too) I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation (the position I can more readily imagine myself in) than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.\n\nI'm aware of both these biases, and of course, like everything else in our world of matter and men, my views are also subject to Newton's First Law, which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.\n\n___\n\n##And so...\nwith those caveats in mind, change my views please, if you will: any or all of them. Even if you don't succeed in changing them entirely, I'll welcome any added perspective you can provide me, and I believe I'm open to that much at the very least.\n\n____\n\n##PS: Support roles\n\nA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of (ideally) neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a person's support system (immediate family and close friends), suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral, but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. I'd tentatively agree with that, with the proviso that I'd apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim (of rape or of slander). I'd add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when they're not acting on those beliefs in a way that's liable to directly cause harm to someone else.\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The justice system deals with the accused, their guilt or innocence, and what to do with them.

By *presume*, I don't mean *conclude*, just as the justice system presuming innocence does not mean it *concludes* innocence. *Presume* just means to treat somebody *as if* it were the case.

Virginia / Rolling Stone debacle is when people (including journalists) confuse and conflate the two systems. A victim support system follows the wishes and needs of the victim/accuser. They have no roll in evaluating the actual innocence or guilt of the accused, and the accuracy and truth is irrelevant. They can, and perhaps should, advise the victim on how to report the issue to the justice system, but to be a support system they must acquiesce to the victim's wishes and needs. The justice system *must* scrutinize the accusations and *can't* take sides, so victims should not *expect* support from the justice system and they should expect to be scrutinized. There is simply no way around this unless there happens to be a completely independent reporting of the crime, i.e., the victim is unnecessary to the whole justice process.

While in real life \"truth\" is not black and white, believing someone is. Do you really think that the victim of a trauma (rape) is going to hear you saying \"I don't believe you, but I also don't DISbelieve you\" and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldn't. If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. \n\nImagine a victim of another \"emotional\" and hard to prove crime. Imagine someone came to you and said \"Someone is stalking me. They keep calling and when I answer the phone, they are breathing into it heavily or they just hang up. I hear tapping on my window at night. I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape.\" While that story *could* be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying \"I don't really believe you\" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.\n\nI don't disagree that rapes accusations should not be made in public unless there is hard evidence. If someone's name is going to go on the record, if it's going to affect their life, then those accused of rape deserve to have evidence presented against them, not just someone's word. But, in the rape debate, I feel like people forget that being accused of *any crime* ruins someone's life. Think about people who are accused of child abuse, murder, even theft. If your employer gets wind that you're the prime suspect in a murder investigation, you bet your ass there are going to be consequences. So your argument isn't necessarily about rape, it's about an accusation of crime at all. No one is \"innocent until proven guilty\". For an extreme example, look at OJ or Casey Anthony. Stop by /r/serialpodcast and check out the debates people get in over a man who was convicted of murder 15 years ago. I would say that grey area is just an inherent part of our legal system. \n\nTo tip my hand a little, I am a woman in her late 20s who was sexually assaulted in college. I knew my assailant-- I worked with him-- and my assault was one of those messy instances where, as a victim, I didn't do the *right* thing. I was drinking underage, I trusted someone that others perceived as \"shady\", I was very friendly and kind to him which \"gave him the wrong idea\". I know in my heart that I was assaulted. I had to quit my job because when he inevitably got fired, everyone in my workplace *blamed* me, started rumors about my sexual activity, and all-around implied (or sometimes, said outright) that I was lying. \n\nMy sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be \"put on trial\", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. \n\nI told that story because the social/cultural pressures and forces that surround rape cases are a *major* part of why women push for every rape accuser to be believed immediately. Because it is so easy to brush rape off, to read a radical feminist's post on tumblr about how \"all sex is rape\" and internalize the fact that, if women really wanted to, they could avoid most rape-y situations. Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. I made bad choices. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any *less* bad? \n\nIn our public's eyes, it comes off that way. When we can avoid putting the victim's life on trial, when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire), I think we can move forward and have a more easily received conversation about false rape accusations. But our culture and national conversation stands, and you can't ignore that piece of it in my mind.

I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape.\" While that story *could* be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying \"I don't really believe you\" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.\n\nI don't disagree that rapes accusations should not be made in public unless there is hard evidence. If someone's name is going to go on the record, if it's going to affect their life, then those accused of rape deserve to have evidence presented against them, not just someone's word. But, in the rape debate, I feel like people forget that being accused of *any crime* ruins someone's life. Think about people who are accused of child abuse, murder, even theft. If your employer gets wind that you're the prime suspect in a murder investigation, you bet your ass there are going to be consequences. So your argument isn't necessarily about rape, it's about an accusation of crime at all. No one is \"innocent until proven guilty\". For an extreme example, look at OJ or Casey Anthony. Stop by /r/serialpodcast and check out the debates people get in over a man who was convicted of murder 15 years ago. I would say that grey area is just an inherent part of our legal system. \n\nTo tip my hand a little, I am a woman in her late 20s who was sexually assaulted in college. I knew my assailant-- I worked with him-- and my assault was one of those messy instances where, as a victim, I didn't do the *right* thing. I was drinking underage, I trusted someone that others perceived as \"shady\", I was very friendly and kind to him which \"gave him the wrong idea\". I know in my heart that I was assaulted. I had to quit my job because when he inevitably got fired, everyone in my workplace *blamed* me, started rumors about my sexual activity, and all-around implied (or sometimes, said outright) that I was lying. \n\nMy sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be \"put on trial\", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. \n\nI told that story because the social/cultural pressures and forces that surround rape cases are a *major* part of why women push for every rape accuser to be believed immediately. Because it is so easy to brush rape off, to read a radical feminist's post on tumblr about how \"all sex is rape\" and internalize the fact that, if women really wanted to, they could avoid most rape-y situations. Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. I made bad choices. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any *less* bad? \n\nIn our public's eyes, it comes off that way. When we can avoid putting the victim's life on trial, when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire), I think we can move forward and have a more easily received conversation about false rape accusations. But our culture and national conversation stands, and you can't ignore that piece of it in my mind.

If someone's name is going to go on the record, if it's going to affect their life, then those accused of rape deserve to have evidence presented against them, not just someone's word. But, in the rape debate, I feel like people forget that being accused of *any crime* ruins someone's life. Think about people who are accused of child abuse, murder, even theft. If your employer gets wind that you're the prime suspect in a murder investigation, you bet your ass there are going to be consequences. So your argument isn't necessarily about rape, it's about an accusation of crime at all. No one is \"innocent until proven guilty\". For an extreme example, look at OJ or Casey Anthony.

Do you really think that the victim of a trauma (rape) is going to hear you saying \"I don't believe you, but I also don't DISbelieve you\" and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldn't. If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. \n\nImagine a victim of another \"emotional\" and hard to prove crime. Imagine someone came to you and said \"Someone is stalking me. They keep calling and when I answer the phone, they are breathing into it heavily or they just hang up. I hear tapping on my window at night. I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape.\" While that story *could* be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying \"I don't really believe you\" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.\n\nI don't disagree that rapes accusations should not be made in public unless there is hard evidence. If someone's name is going to go on the record, if it's going to affect their life, then those accused of rape deserve to have evidence presented against them, not just someone's word. But, in the rape debate, I feel like people forget that being accused of *any crime* ruins someone's life. Think about people who are accused of child abuse, murder, even theft. If your employer gets wind that you're the prime suspect in a murder investigation, you bet your ass there are going to be consequences. So your argument isn't necessarily about rape, it's about an accusation of crime at all. No one is \"innocent until proven guilty\". For an extreme example, look at OJ or Casey Anthony. Stop by /r/serialpodcast and check out the debates people get in over a man who was convicted of murder 15 years ago. I would say that grey area is just an inherent part of our legal system. \n\nTo tip my hand a little, I am a woman in her late 20s who was sexually assaulted in college. I knew my assailant-- I worked with him-- and my assault was one of those messy instances where, as a victim, I didn't do the *right* thing. I was drinking underage, I trusted someone that others perceived as \"shady\", I was very friendly and kind to him which \"gave him the wrong idea\". I know in my heart that I was assaulted. I had to quit my job because when he inevitably got fired, everyone in my workplace *blamed* me, started rumors about my sexual activity, and all-around implied (or sometimes, said outright) that I was lying. \n\nMy sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be \"put on trial\", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. \n\nI told that story because the social/cultural pressures and forces that surround rape cases are a *major* part of why women push for every rape accuser to be believed immediately. Because it is so easy to brush rape off, to read a radical feminist's post on tumblr about how \"all sex is rape\" and internalize the fact that, if women really wanted to, they could avoid most rape-y situations. Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. I made bad choices. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any *less* bad? \n\nIn our public's eyes, it comes off that way. When we can avoid putting the victim's life on trial, when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire), I think we can move forward and have a more easily received conversation about false rape accusations. But our culture and national conversation stands, and you can't ignore that piece of it in my mind.

A woman who gave consent might feel she was raped because the guy didn't call the next day although he promised, that doesn't mean the guy should get time for it. Your appeal to emotion is neither needed nor wanted in a logical conversation.\n\n&gt; If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. \n\nYes, as far as I know that's pretty much the definition of disbelieving: not believing.\n\n&gt; Imagine a victim of another \"emotional\" and hard to prove crime.

I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape.\" While that story could be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying \"I don't really believe you\" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.\n\nOnce again, you are using appeal to emotion. The problem in this case is that believing that *someone* relies solely on the credibility he/she has before you. Is he/she a good friend who you know never lies? Then in this case you need little to no evidence to believe the story. Is he/she some person who said this to you on the street? Then the \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\" response is actually the best response you can give. Is he/she a known pathological liar/drama queen/sociopath? Then you have no reason to believe that person, without solid evidence. As far as I see it, my duty as a person, in every situation, is to assess information provided to me and make the best logical decision based on it, not to be an emotional doormat. No one should care how him/her not believing a story will make somebody else feel, if it's not believable then one shouldn't believe it out of sympathy.\n\n&gt; I know in my heart that I was assaulted.\n\nSpeaking of credibility, this is a perfect way to lose it. The only reason people \"know in their heart\" is because they don't know in their head. If all you have is a gut feeling, then I reserve my right to believe that gut feeling is wrong, regardless what that gut feeling is about.\n\n&gt; My sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be \"put on trial\", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. \n\nSounds to me like rationalization. I sincerely cannot imagine the kind of skeletons that could be dug up, or the kind of weird sexual history you have, but I'm not a woman, so I don't know. Also, AFAIK your employer doesn't investigate, police does.\n\n&gt; Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any less bad? \n\nLook at that, it turned from a \"I know in my heart\" to a \"I know I was raped\".\n\n&gt;  when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire)\n\nI've heard that so many times... Agression? Of course, most rapes are violent. Power? That's like saying people only kill to exercit their power upon others. While it is true that many rapists do what they do because it gives them the feeling of power, it is also true that many simply want to have sex. With prostitution illegal, for many of these men, the sexual desire build up to the point where they simply don't care anymore whether they hurt another human being. Or maybe they were drunk and couldn't control their urges. Or maybe they were stupid enough to believe sex with a passed out girl is ok because *insert made-up reason here*. What about the massive rapes during WW2? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying any of the above is acceptable/justifiable or not a heinous crime, all I'm saying is that rape happens for a lot of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with this feminist fantasy of \"rape is the way men opress womyn\".\n\nSo, where are we here? To me, you are a stranger. I've never met you, and chances are I never will. You claim you are a woman. I believe that. However, the claims about your assault I don't believe, mainly because of the generic \"I was rape\" story, your exprimation(\"I know in my heart\") and the reason to not report your alleged assault, which sounds to me a bit like dodgy rationalization. Admitting to having a weird sexual history and \"skeletons that you hid away for a reason\" doesn't help either. Also, since you already made 2 appeals to emotion in the beginning, it makes me feel that you used the story as a crutch in order to support an argument (I can't tell exactly which one, since you're lacking a conclusion and you \"attack\" OP's post as a whole rather than each individual view), which, needless to say, reduces the credibility of your argument even further.\n\nYour comment is a perfect ilustration of what OP is talking about. You bring forward a story, I evaluate it for its credibility based on the evidence (since this is not a trial, there is no hard evidence like DNA samples, but I'm willing to assume you're telling a true story) and take a stance. My stance at the moment is disbelief, since I find the evidence lacking. You may reply and bring forward more evidence, in which case I will change my opinion. Until then, I reserve my right not to believe you.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- OP is wrong on point A: disbelief is pretty much defined as refusal or reluctance to believe. The only other option would be to refuse to be involved and/or think about the case, but as long as you're involved, you have to start from somewhere (either belief or disbelief). As a judge, one could only hope that he/she starts from disbelief.\n\n- B: OP is right. In the lack of solid incriminating evidence, or an extremely credible witness (e.g. friend) the only reasonable option is disbelief. This is why my opinion is that the judicial system in general in general need to be less publicized(**not less transparent**), less paparazzi, because it polarizes the audience even before evidence becomes available and, in many cases, causes irreparable damage to innocent individuals."}, {"id": "cmqacmv", "body": "&gt; Do you really think that the victim of a trauma (rape) is going to hear you saying \"I don't believe you, but I also don't DISbelieve you\" and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldn't. \n\nI agree with you. Also, it doesn't really matter how the victim feels. A woman who gave consent might feel she was raped because the guy didn't call the next day although he promised, that doesn't mean the guy should get time for it. Your appeal to emotion is neither needed nor wanted in a logical conversation.\n\n&gt; If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. \n\nYes, as far as I know that's pretty much the definition of disbelieving: not believing.\n\n&gt; Imagine a victim of another \"emotional\" and hard to prove crime.

It's hard for me to discuss sexual assault without putting on my \"feminist\" hat, meaning without feeling or implying that people who are concerned primarily with false allegations are \"women haters\" or misgynists.

I work in computer science and the startup world and the effect I see that capitalism has on innovation and groundbreaking technological progress (and probably some other selfish reasons) leads me to be probably a lot more accepting of it than many social progressives are. still, I empathize very strongly with, e.g., Marxists, despite not being one at all, and think they are probably more right than they are wrong in general. then again, I am far from an economist, and I have much more domain knowledge on philosophy/ethics/metaethics and social issues, so I think that helps me to admit that I just don't really know the right answer(s) too. \n\nthere just seems to be far more sheer ignorance, dismissal of evidence, and outright hatred on display when discussing social issues (though there's still a ton with economics too of course), and it is hard to \"agree to disagree\" when someone is bigoted, factually wrong, or incapable of logical reasoning (and reddit seriously, seriously struggles with logic) and it is not simply up to preference, I suppose. I guess another reason is that people who have bigoted social views are actually contributing directly or indirectly to harming other people and making their lives worse, whereas random people's thoughts and actions are not going to do much to change capitalism, at least for now.\n"}, {"id": "cmqacmv", "body": "&gt; Do you really think that the victim of a trauma (rape) is going to hear you saying \"I don't believe you, but I also don't DISbelieve you\" and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldn't. \n\nI agree with you. Also, it doesn't really matter how the victim feels. A woman who gave consent might feel she was raped because the guy didn't call the next day although he promised, that doesn't mean the guy should get time for it. Your appeal to emotion is neither needed nor wanted in a logical conversation.\n\n&gt; If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. \n\nYes, as far as I know that's pretty much the definition of disbelieving: not believing.\n\n&gt; Imagine a victim of another \"emotional\" and hard to prove crime. Imagine someone came to you and said \"Someone is stalking me. They keep calling and when I answer the phone, they are breathing into it heavily or they just hang up. I hear tapping on my window at night. I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape.\" While that story could be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying \"I don't really believe you\" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.\n\nOnce again, you are using appeal to emotion. The problem in this case is that believing that *someone* relies solely on the credibility he/she has before you. Is he/she a good friend who you know never lies? Then in this case you need little to no evidence to believe the story. Is he/she some person who said this to you on the street? Then the \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\" response is actually the best response you can give. Is he/she a known pathological liar/drama queen/sociopath? Then you have no reason to believe that person, without solid evidence. As far as I see it, my duty as a person, in every situation, is to assess information provided to me and make the best logical decision based on it, not to be an emotional doormat. No one should care how him/her not believing a story will make somebody else feel, if it's not believable then one shouldn't believe it out of sympathy.\n\n&gt; I know in my heart that I was assaulted.\n\nSpeaking of credibility, this is a perfect way to lose it. The only reason people \"know in their heart\" is because they don't know in their head. If all you have is a gut feeling, then I reserve my right to believe that gut feeling is wrong, regardless what that gut feeling is about.\n\n&gt; My sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be \"put on trial\", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. \n\nSounds to me like rationalization. I sincerely cannot imagine the kind of skeletons that could be dug up, or the kind of weird sexual history you have, but I'm not a woman, so I don't know. Also, AFAIK your employer doesn't investigate, police does.\n\n&gt; Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any less bad? \n\nLook at that, it turned from a \"I know in my heart\" to a \"I know I was raped\".\n\n&gt;  when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire)\n\nI've heard that so many times... Agression? Of course, most rapes are violent. Power? That's like saying people only kill to exercit their power upon others. While it is true that many rapists do what they do because it gives them the feeling of power, it is also true that many simply want to have sex. With prostitution illegal, for many of these men, the sexual desire build up to the point where they simply don't care anymore whether they hurt another human being. Or maybe they were drunk and couldn't control their urges. Or maybe they were stupid enough to believe sex with a passed out girl is ok because *insert made-up reason here*. What about the massive rapes during WW2? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying any of the above is acceptable/justifiable or not a heinous crime, all I'm saying is that rape happens for a lot of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with this feminist fantasy of \"rape is the way men opress womyn\".\n\nSo, where are we here? To me, you are a stranger. I've never met you, and chances are I never will. You claim you are a woman. I believe that. However, the claims about your assault I don't believe, mainly because of the generic \"I was rape\" story, your exprimation(\"I know in my heart\") and the reason to not report your alleged assault, which sounds to me a bit like dodgy rationalization. Admitting to having a weird sexual history and \"skeletons that you hid away for a reason\" doesn't help either. Also, since you already made 2 appeals to emotion in the beginning, it makes me feel that you used the story as a crutch in order to support an argument (I can't tell exactly which one, since you're lacking a conclusion and you \"attack\" OP's post as a whole rather than each individual view), which, needless to say, reduces the credibility of your argument even further.\n\nYour comment is a perfect ilustration of what OP is talking about. You bring forward a story, I evaluate it for its credibility based on the evidence (since this is not a trial, there is no hard evidence like DNA samples, but I'm willing to assume you're telling a true story) and take a stance. My stance at the moment is disbelief, since I find the evidence lacking. You may reply and bring forward more evidence, in which case I will change my opinion. Until then, I reserve my right not to believe you.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- OP is wrong on point A: disbelief is pretty much defined as refusal or reluctance to believe. The only other option would be to refuse to be involved and/or think about the case, but as long as you're involved, you have to start from somewhere (either belief or disbelief). As a judge, one could only hope that he/she starts from disbelief.\n\n- B: OP is right. In the lack of solid incriminating evidence, or an extremely credible witness (e.g. friend) the only reasonable option is disbelief. This is why my opinion is that the judicial system in general in general need to be less publicized(**not less transparent**), less paparazzi, because it polarizes the audience even before evidence becomes available and, in many cases, causes irreparable damage to innocent individuals."}, {"id": "cmqgxdm", "body": "Your error here is in assuming \"that's an appeal to emotion\" somehow invalidates the argument, or is even an *interesting* observation to make. Of course it's an appeal to emotion. No shit, Sherlock.\n\nDo you know how neurotypical humans induce others to do things? *They appeal to emotion*. If you don't, that means that you have a *big problem* in dealing with neurotypical humans. If you don't have a program in your head that actually properly handles appeals to emotion, rather than just throwing \"ERROR CODE 43\" and dismissing the statement, then you are going to have *serious trouble* dealing with people.\n\nRape law and social custom is all, entirely, 100% top-to-bottom about appeals to emotion. If your mental models can't survive efficiently in that sphere of human conduct, then you're going to keep running up against this problem that you're getting now: not being taken seriously."}, {"id": "cmqacmv", "body": "&gt; Do you really think that the victim of a trauma (rape) is going to hear you saying \"I don't believe you, but I also don't DISbelieve you\" and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldn't. \n\nI agree with you. Also, it doesn't really matter how the victim feels. A woman who gave consent might feel she was raped because the guy didn't call the next day although he promised, that doesn't mean the guy should get time for it. Your appeal to emotion is neither needed nor wanted in a logical conversation.\n\n&gt; If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. \n\nYes, as far as I know that's pretty much the definition of disbelieving: not believing.\n\n&gt; Imagine a victim of another \"emotional\" and hard to prove crime. Imagine someone came to you and said \"Someone is stalking me. They keep calling and when I answer the phone, they are breathing into it heavily or they just hang up. I hear tapping on my window at night. I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape.\" While that story could be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying \"I don't really believe you\" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.\n\nOnce again, you are using appeal to emotion. The problem in this case is that believing that *someone* relies solely on the credibility he/she has before you. Is he/she a good friend who you know never lies? Then in this case you need little to no evidence to believe the story. Is he/she some person who said this to you on the street? Then the \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\" response is actually the best response you can give. Is he/she a known pathological liar/drama queen/sociopath? Then you have no reason to believe that person, without solid evidence. As far as I see it, my duty as a person, in every situation, is to assess information provided to me and make the best logical decision based on it, not to be an emotional doormat. No one should care how him/her not believing a story will make somebody else feel, if it's not believable then one shouldn't believe it out of sympathy.\n\n&gt; I know in my heart that I was assaulted.\n\nSpeaking of credibility, this is a perfect way to lose it. The only reason people \"know in their heart\" is because they don't know in their head. If all you have is a gut feeling, then I reserve my right to believe that gut feeling is wrong, regardless what that gut feeling is about.\n\n&gt; My sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be \"put on trial\", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. \n\nSounds to me like rationalization. I sincerely cannot imagine the kind of skeletons that could be dug up, or the kind of weird sexual history you have, but I'm not a woman, so I don't know. Also, AFAIK your employer doesn't investigate, police does.\n\n&gt; Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any less bad? \n\nLook at that, it turned from a \"I know in my heart\" to a \"I know I was raped\".\n\n&gt;  when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire)\n\nI've heard that so many times... Agression? Of course, most rapes are violent. Power? That's like saying people only kill to exercit their power upon others. While it is true that many rapists do what they do because it gives them the feeling of power, it is also true that many simply want to have sex. With prostitution illegal, for many of these men, the sexual desire build up to the point where they simply don't care anymore whether they hurt another human being. Or maybe they were drunk and couldn't control their urges. Or maybe they were stupid enough to believe sex with a passed out girl is ok because *insert made-up reason here*.

Since I did emphasize the contrast I was trying to make, your criticism here amounts to saying that I used the word \"disbelief\" incorrectly, which is honestly beside the point.\n\nNow, as to my use of \"disbelief\", here's a dictionary citation:\n\n&gt;[a feeling that you do not or cannot believe or accept that something is true or real](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disbelief)"}, {"id": "2orfda", "body": "##^(Advance apologies for the length and possibly the perceived tone of this post, for which I beg your indulgence. I tried to explain my position as clearly as I could, and in cases like that, my writing tends to take a decidedly formal swerve. I'm aware that this carefully formal style may make me sound smug, pompous, or whatever other adjectives of oblivious self-inflation may apply. If anything I write strikes you that way, I'm sorry. I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone, rather than from condescension.)\n___\n\n##Background\n\nThis topic is on my mind because it's apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkin's *The Newsroom*, and I just read in today's New York Times an [article about the controversy that episode aroused](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/arts/television/hbos-the-newsroom-draws-backlash-over-rape-plot.html). It seems the episode involved a credible, empathetic accuser and a \"sketchy\", offscreen accused, so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so, a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience, without any conviction or trial.\n\nThis seems to have aroused a huge backlash, with articles published [on Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/a-terrible-episode-with-worse-timing-the-newsroom-tack-1668181204) and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to \"victim-blame a woman who was raped\"\u2014despite the fact, that, as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article, he *created* this character to be a sympathetic *alleged* rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.\n\nAnother quotation from the NYT article:\n\n&gt;Emily Nussbaum, the TV critic for The New Yorker, wrote of the producer character: \u201c**He argues that the idealistic thing to do is not to believe her story.**\u201d\n\n___\n##Presentation of my views\n\nIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one's story\" with \"disbelieving one's story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite\u2014but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something, and I don't have a good reason to believe one or the other, my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life, but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.\n\nMoreover, I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed, uncorroborated things, and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason, I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.\n\nFurthermore, even if, for argument's sake, one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true, I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sort\u2014*viz.*, \"innocent until proven guilty\"\u2014would remain vitally important, because its abrogation in *any* case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone else's life, while facing little or no potential negative impact him- or herself.\n___\n##Summary of my views\n\nThe views I'm asking you to change, if you can, are:\n\n1. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore, assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.\n\n2. The protocol of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth (how could it be?) but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such, it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.\n\n3. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third, most important possibility of all, which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.\n\n_____\n\n##My biases\n\nI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level (an INTP personality type, if you like [the Myers-Briggs categorization system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)). Furthermore, I'm a man and do not personally know any rape victims that I'm aware of, so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level (which of course I do, too) I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation (the position I can more readily imagine myself in) than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.\n\nI'm aware of both these biases, and of course, like everything else in our world of matter and men, my views are also subject to Newton's First Law, which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.\n\n___\n\n##And so...\nwith those caveats in mind, change my views please, if you will: any or all of them. Even if you don't succeed in changing them entirely, I'll welcome any added perspective you can provide me, and I believe I'm open to that much at the very least.\n\n____\n\n##PS: Support roles\n\nA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of (ideally) neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a person's support system (immediate family and close friends), suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral, but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. I'd tentatively agree with that, with the proviso that I'd apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim (of rape or of slander). I'd add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when they're not acting on those beliefs in a way that's liable to directly cause harm to someone else.\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The issue of *how* to choose your belief at will thus hand-waved away, the question of *what* belief to choose becomes a decision with partially-unknown ramifications, just like any other, and the question becomes what basis to make it on. \n\nYou make a few further preliminary assumptions, that I'll accept for argument's sake. To list them:\n\n1. No conceivable belief exists in regards to the question at hand that does not help one of the two individuals at stake here and harm the other.\n\n2.

Assuming I have, and even after accepting all the assumptions I listed, I'd still disagree with your conclusion. Utilitarianism is certainly one logically attractive framework for making choices, but it's not the only one we use.\n\nAn even more fundamental Rule that guides our choices, I would say, is the one made famous by the Hippocratic Oath: **First do no harm.** In other words, inaction is NOT the same as action with regard to the responsibility it implies. Ethicists may have [probed the borders of this rule, and even questioned its self-consistency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), but the very fact that it's been so extensively investigated shows that it's an integral part of human's natural morality. Nearly everybody, I believe would accept it (or at any rate something that appears very close to it) when it comes to deciding the question of whether it's ethical for individual A to rob from individual B to give to individual C (or, for that matter, for A to rob B and keep the money himself)\u2014even though the expected value of that transaction is on average 0, and in many cases may be positive.\n\n##My questions to you\n\nIn light of the above, my questions to you are:\n\n1.

That's clearly level-headed and baldly obvious.  It can get tricky, though.  Let's run through some situations.\n\n* Man A informs you that God sent down his only Son Jesus Christ as your lord and Savior.\n\n* Man B informs you that Jesus was sent down, but was not God's son, and that Muhammad is God's prophet and bring's God's word.\n\n* You, not presumptively believing either of them, choose not to convert to either religion and remain a Pastafarian open to future conversion\n\nSo far so good.  These were two un-evidenced assertions and you chose to believe neither of them.  You maintained your original position of absurd parody religion/nonbelief, but did so without prejudice against future attempts by Man A or Man B.\n\nThis situation represent a clear demonstration of the non-presumption principle (as we have named it just now).\n\nNow for a harder one:\n\n* Man A informs you that God sent down his only Son Jesus Christ as your lord and Savior.\n\n* Man B says \"That's not true.\"\n\n* You, not presumptively believing either of them, choose not to convert to Christianity and remain a Pastafarian open to future conversion.\n\nIn this case, your inaction is non-neutral.  The two sides have encompassed the entire available logical market and you have no choice but to be in accord with one of them.  You either believe that Christ died for your sins, or you don't.  There are huge ranges of individuation available within each camp, but the entire world, ultimately, falls into one camp of the other.  Even rocks can be safely categorized as \"things that do not believe Christ died for their sins.\"\n\nThis is where the problem with the way rapes are handled comes from.  We have an accuser and a denier.  These two positions occupy the entire logical maketplace.  Either you believe this happened, or you do not.  A position of skepticism is just a finer point that fills within the non-belief camp.  Of course, that's okay.  Investigators must move with skepticism, but there is a further problem.\n\nUnlike our good friends Man A and Man B, your choice is not simply a choice about yourself.  If you incorrectly fall into the wrong initial starting position, you are not only affecting yourself.  As a reporter, investigator, police officer, judge, juror, school administrator, or gossiping student your actions cannot be rendered neutral in this kind of case.  Your skeptical behavior is intrinsically damaging to the rape victim and helpful to the rapist - OR - damaging to the false-accuser and helpful to the falsely-accused.\n\nDoing nothing following a rape accusation is guaranteed to victimize whichever person is the victim and play into the hands of whichever person is the aggressor.  I disagree with your statement that we have no idea how common false accusations are - I understand that they are much rarer than real accusations, but that is not my chosen point of contention with you - but even in a world in which the division were 50-50 (perhaps we agree that this is an absurd world) it is unconscionable to maintain a situation in which either a rapist and victim, or a slanderer and victim, should be forced to continue attending classes in t he same building.  In such a situation it will be the innocent party who is living under greater duress and who will crumble under social pressure first, assuring nearly-universal wins for the aggressor.\n\nInaction is not a neutral act in this kind of case, and so the non-presumptive principle remains good for withholding judgment, but utterly fails to prescribe responsible actions.\n\nEven a coin-flip to determine initial presumptive positions for the purpose of early action would be preferable to a default inaction in terms of the expected return in outcomes."}, {"id": "cmr00po", "body": "&gt; In this case, your inaction is non-neutral.

I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone, rather than from condescension.)\n___\n\n##Background\n\nThis topic is on my mind because it's apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkin's *The Newsroom*, and I just read in today's New York Times an [article about the controversy that episode aroused](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/arts/television/hbos-the-newsroom-draws-backlash-over-rape-plot.html). It seems the episode involved a credible, empathetic accuser and a \"sketchy\", offscreen accused, so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so, a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience, without any conviction or trial.\n\nThis seems to have aroused a huge backlash, with articles published [on Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/a-terrible-episode-with-worse-timing-the-newsroom-tack-1668181204) and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to \"victim-blame a woman who was raped\"\u2014despite the fact, that, as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article, he *created* this character to be a sympathetic *alleged* rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.\n\nAnother quotation from the NYT article:\n\n&gt;Emily Nussbaum, the TV critic for The New Yorker, wrote of the producer character: \u201c**He argues that the idealistic thing to do is not to believe her story.**\u201d\n\n___\n##Presentation of my views\n\nIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one's story\" with \"disbelieving one's story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite\u2014but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something, and I don't have a good reason to believe one or the other, my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life, but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.\n\nMoreover, I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed, uncorroborated things, and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason, I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.\n\nFurthermore, even if, for argument's sake, one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true, I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sort\u2014*viz.*, \"innocent until proven guilty\"\u2014would remain vitally important, because its abrogation in *any* case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone else's life, while facing little or no potential negative impact him- or herself.\n___\n##Summary of my views\n\nThe views I'm asking you to change, if you can, are:\n\n1. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore, assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.\n\n2. The protocol of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth (how could it be?) but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such, it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.\n\n3. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third, most important possibility of all, which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.\n\n_____\n\n##My biases\n\nI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level (an INTP personality type, if you like [the Myers-Briggs categorization system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)). Furthermore, I'm a man and do not personally know any rape victims that I'm aware of, so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level (which of course I do, too) I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation (the position I can more readily imagine myself in) than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.\n\nI'm aware of both these biases, and of course, like everything else in our world of matter and men, my views are also subject to Newton's First Law, which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.\n\n___\n\n##And so...\nwith those caveats in mind, change my views please, if you will: any or all of them. Even if you don't succeed in changing them entirely, I'll welcome any added perspective you can provide me, and I believe I'm open to that much at the very least.\n\n____\n\n##PS: Support roles\n\nA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of (ideally) neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a person's support system (immediate family and close friends), suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral, but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. I'd tentatively agree with that, with the proviso that I'd apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim (of rape or of slander). I'd add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when they're not acting on those beliefs in a way that's liable to directly cause harm to someone else.\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even, if one's judgement of character (like the journalist's) leads him to believe one side over the other, individual judgement like that is too fallacious and unreliable to make it the standard we base our actions on, when their potential consequences are so large.\n\nI'd have a much more difficult time making a case against someone who launches a public accusation (via her website) against someone when she knows *from firsthand knowledge* that he did it, and in fact I wouldn't make that case."}, {"id": "cmpwq97", "body": "He wasn't making the case against her making a public accusation.

IOW, I distinguish between actions based on firsthand knowledge, and actions based on fallible individual judgment as to which of two sides to believe.\n\n&gt;That's what I'm pointing out, the Jezebel article completely mischaracterizes the conversation had in the episode.\n\nThat may be so, but I think it's beside the point, since the case made by the Jezebel article (and similar ones) is the main thing that I responded to, not the *Newsroom* episode that it was responding to.

I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone, rather than from condescension.)\n___\n\n##Background\n\nThis topic is on my mind because it's apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkin's *The Newsroom*, and I just read in today's New York Times an [article about the controversy that episode aroused](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/arts/television/hbos-the-newsroom-draws-backlash-over-rape-plot.html). It seems the episode involved a credible, empathetic accuser and a \"sketchy\", offscreen accused, so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so, a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience, without any conviction or trial.\n\nThis seems to have aroused a huge backlash, with articles published [on Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/a-terrible-episode-with-worse-timing-the-newsroom-tack-1668181204) and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to \"victim-blame a woman who was raped\"\u2014despite the fact, that, as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article, he *created* this character to be a sympathetic *alleged* rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.\n\nAnother quotation from the NYT article:\n\n&gt;Emily Nussbaum, the TV critic for The New Yorker, wrote of the producer character: \u201c**He argues that the idealistic thing to do is not to believe her story.**\u201d\n\n___\n##Presentation of my views\n\nIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one's story\" with \"disbelieving one's story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite\u2014but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something, and I don't have a good reason to believe one or the other, my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life, but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.\n\nMoreover, I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed, uncorroborated things, and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason, I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.\n\nFurthermore, even if, for argument's sake, one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true, I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sort\u2014*viz.*, \"innocent until proven guilty\"\u2014would remain vitally important, because its abrogation in *any* case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone else's life, while facing little or no potential negative impact him- or herself.\n___\n##Summary of my views\n\nThe views I'm asking you to change, if you can, are:\n\n1. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore, assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.\n\n2. The protocol of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth (how could it be?) but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such, it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.\n\n3. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third, most important possibility of all, which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.\n\n_____\n\n##My biases\n\nI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level (an INTP personality type, if you like [the Myers-Briggs categorization system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)). Furthermore, I'm a man and do not personally know any rape victims that I'm aware of, so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level (which of course I do, too) I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation (the position I can more readily imagine myself in) than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.\n\nI'm aware of both these biases, and of course, like everything else in our world of matter and men, my views are also subject to Newton's First Law, which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.\n\n___\n\n##And so...\nwith those caveats in mind, change my views please, if you will: any or all of them. Even if you don't succeed in changing them entirely, I'll welcome any added perspective you can provide me, and I believe I'm open to that much at the very least.\n\n____\n\n##PS: Support roles\n\nA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of (ideally) neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a person's support system (immediate family and close friends), suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral, but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. I'd tentatively agree with that, with the proviso that I'd apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim (of rape or of slander). I'd add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when they're not acting on those beliefs in a way that's liable to directly cause harm to someone else.\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They're all basically the same person with different powers. The heroes are incapable of losing and seemingly don't ever actually train to get stronger. A great example, I think, is Bleach. Ichigo has huuuuge plot armor however he has lost battles, lost his powers, died and grown a lot as a person. The closest the fairies ever came to this was when acknowlogia or however you spell it blew up the island and seemingly killed all of them except when he didn't. Or the fact that they never ever run out of energy ever. They will literally say \"I'm at my limits\" and then pull out some horseshi* final move that sends the enemy flying. At least in some of the better manga if the big bad is super powerful then the hero gets they butt handed to them until they come back powerful enough to fight them. When they are that powerful usually around the time the hero is \"at their limits\" the big bad is too. In the most recent chapters they were fighting one of the most powerful demons and he was wrecking them like nobody's business without even breaking a sweat and then suddenly one of the guys shows up with some new power and starts fighting back when the big bad unleashes some ultimate death move. And they both shrug it off. Like it's nothing.\nThe reason I'm saying all of this is because they never experience loss and as such never have any reason to grow as characters. Instead they are basically the same people from the first chapter with more powers.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

In it, you will find quantitative as well as qualitative data regarding sexual assault allegations as they go start to finish through the British justice system.  They place the overall rate of false allegations in their time period at 2.9%.  Pages 35-77, \"Understanding Attrition\" are particularly illuminating.  They reveal, in overwhelming majority, a process that is simply incredibly hard to go through, one in which accusers are heavily doubted from the outset, in which genuine-seeming allegations are recanted due to police pressure (especially those coming from disadvantaged people), and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro-seconds.  My view is changed to agree with the 2-8% rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police.  Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion!\n\nOP below:\n\nI have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2% figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher.  With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=K030v14pTe0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=Remarks+of+Lawrence+H.+Cook,+Appellate+Division+Justice,+before+the+Association+of+the+Bar+of+the+City+of+New+York,+Jan.+16,+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8GZcWQFc3&amp;sig=0otNG2D9lkrKK-AjjLFDkJOZltM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R08cVOCnCseMyATIyoDgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Remarks%20of%20Lawrence%20H.%20Cook%2C%20Appellate%20Division%20Justice%2C%20before%20the%20Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York%2C%20Jan.%2016%2C%201974&amp;f=false) for a good overview of the issue.\n\nThe [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf) puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

Yes, we might not be able to figure out the exact value, but we can do things like come up with guaranteed lower bounds (She reported it, evidence showed it was definitely not rape). We can also do things to better approximate the real value like\n\n* Find out the outcome of more than one \"small city\" to get a profile of how rape charges progress legally.\n* Ask women whether they have ever falsely accused a man of rape legally (and not legally).\n* What percent of rape allegations result in the person giving the charge explicitly admitting they made it up?\n* Gather a group of people who have put in legal charges of rape. Ask them basically two questions (anonymously filled out). \"Was the person you charged with rape found guilty of rape?\" and \"Were you raped?\"\n\n\nAnd here's the cool thing... we can combine all this information, and other information you can think to gather, to form a consistent picture of what's likely.

In it, you will find quantitative as well as qualitative data regarding sexual assault allegations as they go start to finish through the British justice system.  They place the overall rate of false allegations in their time period at 2.9%.  Pages 35-77, \"Understanding Attrition\" are particularly illuminating.  They reveal, in overwhelming majority, a process that is simply incredibly hard to go through, one in which accusers are heavily doubted from the outset, in which genuine-seeming allegations are recanted due to police pressure (especially those coming from disadvantaged people), and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro-seconds.  My view is changed to agree with the 2-8% rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police.  Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion!\n\nOP below:\n\nI have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2% figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher.  With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=K030v14pTe0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=Remarks+of+Lawrence+H.+Cook,+Appellate+Division+Justice,+before+the+Association+of+the+Bar+of+the+City+of+New+York,+Jan.+16,+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8GZcWQFc3&amp;sig=0otNG2D9lkrKK-AjjLFDkJOZltM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R08cVOCnCseMyATIyoDgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Remarks%20of%20Lawrence%20H.%20Cook%2C%20Appellate%20Division%20Justice%2C%20before%20the%20Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York%2C%20Jan.%2016%2C%201974&amp;f=false) for a good overview of the issue.\n\nThe [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf) puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

As many rapes do not include violent struggle and are done in private places, a he-said she-said situation without signs of injury would likely be classified as \"unfounded.\"\n\nFor the Purdue paper, I suggest that one three-year study of a small, midwestern metropolitan area, taking 5-10 year old police reports at their word, may not be an accurate sample for the whole country. Also that study has it's own section on wikipedia devoted to its methodological flaws.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#Criticism\n\nI'd recommend reading that whole page actually, and see if it addresses your concerns. There seems to be some doubt about the actual rate of false reporting, but most reliable sources don't go above 8%"}, {"id": "cmq08lk", "body": "I won't spend time critiquing that page again, but I read all of that before making this post and it will suffice to say that the entry, particularly the subheading criticizing Kanin, is poorly sourced and cited.  \n\nMy point with the FBI is that their nation-wide net of data collection means that they are parsing through reports from police departments that use varying methods to determine a claim's veracity.  I simply can't scrutinize the figure based on their report, so I wanted something more detailed.\n\nYes, we agree on the sampling issue with Kanin, but the sample sizes generally do not go much larger with these studies.  The largest I've seen, beside the FBI numbers, had a population of ~700."}, {"id": "2orak0", "body": "Edit 3: [u/grapeban](http://www.reddit.com/user/Grapeban) &amp;#8710; 'd me by providing [this 2005 study](http://paladinservice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gap-or-chasm-rape-report.pdf) from the London Metropolitan University by way of the British Home Office.  In it, you will find quantitative as well as qualitative data regarding sexual assault allegations as they go start to finish through the British justice system.  They place the overall rate of false allegations in their time period at 2.9%.  Pages 35-77, \"Understanding Attrition\" are particularly illuminating.  They reveal, in overwhelming majority, a process that is simply incredibly hard to go through, one in which accusers are heavily doubted from the outset, in which genuine-seeming allegations are recanted due to police pressure (especially those coming from disadvantaged people), and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro-seconds.  My view is changed to agree with the 2-8% rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police.  Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion!\n\nOP below:\n\nI have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2% figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher.  With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=K030v14pTe0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=Remarks+of+Lawrence+H.+Cook,+Appellate+Division+Justice,+before+the+Association+of+the+Bar+of+the+City+of+New+York,+Jan.+16,+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8GZcWQFc3&amp;sig=0otNG2D9lkrKK-AjjLFDkJOZltM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R08cVOCnCseMyATIyoDgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Remarks%20of%20Lawrence%20H.%20Cook%2C%20Appellate%20Division%20Justice%2C%20before%20the%20Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York%2C%20Jan.%2016%2C%201974&amp;f=false) for a good overview of the issue.\n\nThe [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf) puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

In it, you will find quantitative as well as qualitative data regarding sexual assault allegations as they go start to finish through the British justice system.  They place the overall rate of false allegations in their time period at 2.9%.  Pages 35-77, \"Understanding Attrition\" are particularly illuminating.  They reveal, in overwhelming majority, a process that is simply incredibly hard to go through, one in which accusers are heavily doubted from the outset, in which genuine-seeming allegations are recanted due to police pressure (especially those coming from disadvantaged people), and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro-seconds.  My view is changed to agree with the 2-8% rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police.  Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion!\n\nOP below:\n\nI have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2% figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher.  With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=K030v14pTe0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=Remarks+of+Lawrence+H.+Cook,+Appellate+Division+Justice,+before+the+Association+of+the+Bar+of+the+City+of+New+York,+Jan.+16,+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8GZcWQFc3&amp;sig=0otNG2D9lkrKK-AjjLFDkJOZltM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R08cVOCnCseMyATIyoDgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Remarks%20of%20Lawrence%20H.%20Cook%2C%20Appellate%20Division%20Justice%2C%20before%20the%20Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York%2C%20Jan.%2016%2C%201974&amp;f=false) for a good overview of the issue.\n\nThe [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf) puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

She is the sole agent who can say that the rape charge is false.  The police department will not declare a rape charge as false when the complainant, for whatever reason, fails to pursue the charge or cooperate on the case....In short, these cases are declared false only because the complainant admitted they were false.\"\n\n&gt; \"took his data from a police department whose investigation procedures are condemned by the U.S. Justice Department and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. These procedures include the almost universal[17] threat, in this department, of polygraph testing of complainants...\n\nThe wording of the entry is misleading.  You can read Lisak's article [here](http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/SARFalseAllegationsofRape.pdf), by the way.  The only procedure that Lisak identifies as \"condemned\" is the use of the polygraph--there is not a long list of violations that \"includes\" the polygraph.\n\nIt should also be added that Kanin's department made a \"serious offer to polygraph the complainants and the suspects\" (quoting from his study)--it is misleading to call it a \"universal threat...of polygraph testing of complainants.\"  \n\nBut even more importantly, the two universities that Kanin studied did not use polygraph testing.

With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=K030v14pTe0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=Remarks+of+Lawrence+H.+Cook,+Appellate+Division+Justice,+before+the+Association+of+the+Bar+of+the+City+of+New+York,+Jan.+16,+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8GZcWQFc3&amp;sig=0otNG2D9lkrKK-AjjLFDkJOZltM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R08cVOCnCseMyATIyoDgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Remarks%20of%20Lawrence%20H.%20Cook%2C%20Appellate%20Division%20Justice%2C%20before%20the%20Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York%2C%20Jan.%2016%2C%201974&amp;f=false) for a good overview of the issue.\n\nThe [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf) puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=K030v14pTe0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=Remarks+of+Lawrence+H.+Cook,+Appellate+Division+Justice,+before+the+Association+of+the+Bar+of+the+City+of+New+York,+Jan.+16,+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8GZcWQFc3&amp;sig=0otNG2D9lkrKK-AjjLFDkJOZltM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R08cVOCnCseMyATIyoDgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Remarks%20of%20Lawrence%20H.%20Cook%2C%20Appellate%20Division%20Justice%2C%20before%20the%20Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York%2C%20Jan.%2016%2C%201974&amp;f=false) for a good overview of the issue.\n\nThe [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf) puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

In this case, though, the rape victim never got to see her horror story go to trial \u2014 and **the family\u2019s terror hasn\u2019t ended; they\u2019ve even had their house burned down.**\n\n&gt; Daisy\u2019s older brother Charlie, who was himself an athlete for Maryville, was booed by his own classmates during a wrestling meet. **Her mother, a veterinarian, was fired from her job** two weeks after the incident without so much as an explanation, only later learning that her boss feared that her presence \u201cwas putting stress\u201d on her other employees.\n\n&gt;If the story sounds at all familiar, it\u2019s because it almost mirrors the case in Steubenville, Ohio. Like Steubenville, the perpetrators were members of the high school\u2019s immensely successful football team. Like Steubenville, the town of Maryville rallied behind the alleged rapists and ostracized the victim. And like Steubenville, the events in Maryville are quickly becoming a national story.\n\n&gt;Even if Maryville didn\u2019t learn anything from the Steubenville case, the media has an opportunity to show that they have. As rape cases have emerged in the national spotlight, news outlets from ABC News to Yahoo have been quick to portray the accused rapists as the real victims, denied of promising futures, or an opportunity to play in a few high school football games.\n\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/14/2777431/maryville-missouri-rape/\n\n&gt;But she was at a Steubenville party one night in August of 2012, where the attack is said to have occurred. Reports, and a rather incriminating video, indicate that the two boys sexually assaulted the girl over several hours, in the back of a moving car and, later, in a basement. The assault allegedly included anal and vaginal penetration and urination.\n\nThis is the town backing up the coach that hid the Stubinville case\n\n\n&gt;Despite what may look like evidence of a possible cover-up, the coach is enjoying support from Steubenville supporters. An online petition entitled \"The Big Red Nation: Stand up and support Coach Reno Saccoccia\" has over 500 signatures on Change.org, including testimonials like this: \n\nhttp://www.thewire.com/national/2013/03/steubenville-royal-mayo/63650/\n\n\nMore info on Steubenville\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case\n\n&gt;When Savannah complained about her attackers' plea deal, Mr Richawlsky told her to 'get over it and see a therapist', adding that 'the jail was for \"real\" rapists, murderers and robbers', according to an affidavit.\nThe victim's lawyer accused the prosecutor of giving the defendants unduly lenient treatment because they were star athletes at the high school he had attended.\n\n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2197400/Savannah-Dietrich-told-lawyer-assaulted-classmates.html#ixzz3LXLYGjk0 \nFollow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook\n\nOther cases in which girls committed suicide because of bullying.\n\n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Rehtaeh_Parsons\n\n&gt;After her suicide, posters appeared locally in support of the boys who allegedly attacked Parsons.

Given the photographic evidence available, likely because of the question of consent. It is reasonable for persons close to the boys to stand in their defense without compelling evidence.\n\nThe facts of the other cases are too limited for a properly relevant analysis.\n\nAs a final note, in all of these instances, the degree of what could be called stigma is largely focused around the local community.

It is not, however, a social stigma against the victim. Properly categorizing the issue is important to dealing with it.\n\nConsider the possibility that rapists in these scenarios are using the same basic strategies to garner support that they would use to gain the confidence of a victim. Their support base may be significant locally, but is ultimately limited to people they can influence. As such, in most cases, any perceived stigma will only be increasingly alleviated by increasingly wider publicity (with only incredibly popular public figures immune).\n\nAnother thing to consider is that, when we are talking about public figures, there is a much higher incentive for false accusations, both from attention seekers and those who hope for a settlement of some kind. This is obviously not true in the case of the football players, but it may be true of Cosby, especially given the fact that at least one settlement has been reached.\n\n&gt; There are so many women coming out of the woodwork that I have a hard time imagining that they all are making it up.\n\nThe problem here is that you are treating the group of women who have come forward as the population in your evaluation of that probability. The proper population is all women who have ever interacted with Cosby closely enough that they could substantiate such allegations. The chance that x/x people are making things up is diminutive barring group think dynamics (which are almost certainly not in play), but the chance that x/y people are, if it should turn out that y &gt;&gt; x, is much higher.

(don't dismiss this as people trying to get out of jury duty, in reality most people are actually pretty pumped about trying jury duty for the first time and yea, that's just not whats going on here)\n\nBasically, what I'm saying is that with something like sexual assault, there is a certain stigma attached that makes you look like a victim. Vast majority of people would prefer to just hide it and never tell anyone. \n\nI think the generally accepted statistic for what percentage of sexual assaults are actually reported is around 25% - and from my personal experience talking to judges this seems like a pretty likely number. I would argue that if only 25% of people are willing to even report it when it is true, its very unlikely that that many people are willing to report it and go through the entire process when its complete bullshit. I personally think a 2 - 5% number would be fairly accurate in the number of false reports.\n\nThe only cases I really look at suspiciously are when ex girlfriends start accusing their former lovers of raping them (I hope this isn't offensive to people)...  nothing more crazy than a woman spited."}, {"id": "cmpyd23", "body": "&gt;  out of those 30, almost invariably 1 or 2 will admit (typically through tears) that they were the victim of a sexual assault and have never told anyone in their life.\n\nJust because someone *thinks* they were victims of sexual assault, or feels like they were victims of sexual assault, doesn't mean they were victims of sexual assault.

In it, you will find quantitative as well as qualitative data regarding sexual assault allegations as they go start to finish through the British justice system.  They place the overall rate of false allegations in their time period at 2.9%.  Pages 35-77, \"Understanding Attrition\" are particularly illuminating.  They reveal, in overwhelming majority, a process that is simply incredibly hard to go through, one in which accusers are heavily doubted from the outset, in which genuine-seeming allegations are recanted due to police pressure (especially those coming from disadvantaged people), and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro-seconds.  My view is changed to agree with the 2-8% rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police.  Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion!\n\nOP below:\n\nI have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2% figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher.  With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.

It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.

Currently there is a very strong stigma attached to those accused of rape, to the point that even proven false accusations can result in vigilante *murders* of those accused. Such allegations, whether a conviction is obtained or not, ruin the lives of those accused.\n\nNow, forcing that stigma over to only those convicted via an acknowledgement of false accusation alleviates that problem and also dramatically lowers the incentive for false accusation.

In it, you will find quantitative as well as qualitative data regarding sexual assault allegations as they go start to finish through the British justice system.  They place the overall rate of false allegations in their time period at 2.9%.  Pages 35-77, \"Understanding Attrition\" are particularly illuminating.  They reveal, in overwhelming majority, a process that is simply incredibly hard to go through, one in which accusers are heavily doubted from the outset, in which genuine-seeming allegations are recanted due to police pressure (especially those coming from disadvantaged people), and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro-seconds.  My view is changed to agree with the 2-8% rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police.  Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion!\n\nOP below:\n\nI have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2% figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher.  With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it.  \n\nThe overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=K030v14pTe0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=Remarks+of+Lawrence+H.+Cook,+Appellate+Division+Justice,+before+the+Association+of+the+Bar+of+the+City+of+New+York,+Jan.+16,+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t8GZcWQFc3&amp;sig=0otNG2D9lkrKK-AjjLFDkJOZltM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R08cVOCnCseMyATIyoDgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Remarks%20of%20Lawrence%20H.%20Cook%2C%20Appellate%20Division%20Justice%2C%20before%20the%20Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York%2C%20Jan.%2016%2C%201974&amp;f=false) for a good overview of the issue.\n\nThe [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf) puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime.\n\nA [peer-reviewed study](http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf) that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities.  \n\nThe consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.\n\n**TL;DR** The 2% rate is a fiction, the 8% rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40% rate as studied by a professor from Purdue.\n\n* Edit 1: added FBI source link.\n* Edit 2: although I don't mind that some of my responses below are being down voted, some of the meatier portions of the debate are now hidden.
