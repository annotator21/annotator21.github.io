When is the last time you had a conversation with a shirt your considering buying in order to assess the quality of it's character?  \n\nI think you have a skewed perspective on how people use this dating resources.  Sure, there is a demographic of people who are looking for hook ups. There is also a demographic of people who use it to feed their starving sense of self-esteem by seeing how many people \"like\" them.  These people have always existed though.  It's not like dating sites made them shallow, it just allowed them be shallow more efficiently.  \n\nIn my experience, the vast majority of women I encounter (I am a straight man so I can only really comment on the women I interact with on these sites) are actually looking for a guy they really like.  They are pretty damn selective at times, and often, a picture of you with your shirt off (no matter how ripped you are) will get you an instant no.  If people were looking just for sex this would not happen.\n\nIt's pretty easy to separate the people who are just looking for a hook up from those who are looking for something more substantial.  You have a profile that you can fill out and people who actually care about meeting that special someone, tend to actually put effort into these.  Ones who are just looking for sex will often explicitly state it.\n\nDo you want to leave meeting someone who you are perfect with to chance, or do you want to take some agency and increase your odds by using these new tools?  Dating sites can increase your odds of creating an optimal relationship for the following reasons:\n\n1.)  Increased exposure:  On a dating sites allow you the opportunity to interact with more people then you would in your daily life.  \n\n2.)  Similar goals: The people on these sites are also looking to meet someone.  It's totally normal to strike up conversations with these people and try to get to know them.  I really wish it was more socially acceptable for me to walk up to strangers on the street and ask them what their passionate about, but sadly our society is not there yet  \n\n3.)  Information exchange:  You can fill out your profile and let people know things about yourself that you think are important.  This will attract the people who will like you and repel those who won't.\n\nThese factors can save you time and energy and increase your odds of meeting someone that you can have a deep meaningful lasting relationship with.  \n \n /u/illfamous are you speaking from experience from these sites or are you making a judgment from an outside perspective?

Online dating allows your first look at a person to include their hobbies and interests, a glimpse into their personality and sense of humor based on what they've written for their profile, and how they've written it.

I don't think that's a bad thing. Instead of struggling and suffering through a somewhat mismatched, semi-compatible relationship because of the difficulty of finding a new partner, people are more free to move on from a mediocre relationship to try and find someone more highly compatible. I think that will ultimately mean more people find better matches, and overall more people ending up in healthier, more fulfilling relationships.\n\n&gt;It cheapens sex.\n\nGood. Sex is way too stigmatized and obsessed-over. Sex is a fun, natural, healthy experience. People who have just gotten laid tend to be nicer to others than people who are full of sexual frustration.

The fact that we are now more efficient at it because we can look at a larger pool (20 people at the bar vs 1000s on the apps/sites) hasn't changed how people do this, that it was the way has always happened.\n\nAnd looks aren't the be all end all for a relationship, I don't know ANYONE who things that. However people have preferences in what they look for in a potential lifelong mate as far as physical appearances go. Ignoring that is just silly as a long term relationship will not work if the two people aren't attracted to each other.\n\nPeople tend to eliminate a potential partner based off of appearance first because appearance only takes a very very short amount of time to judge. Deciding if someone is compatible with you on an emotional/relationship level can take YEARS.\n\nSome online sites/apps like Tinder and AdultFriendFinder are not really dating sites, they are hookup sites that can lead to relationships. People go there because they WANT sex not because they want a longterm relationship.\n\nOther online dating sites are more concerned with personality matches and compatibility in relationships. Sites like eHarmony have you fill out an extensive questionnaire then match you based on your likes/dislikes/personality and what you are looking for on a longterm basis (kids/no kids).\n\nYou can go to the site you want to meet a person interested in the thing you want at the time.\n\n"}, {"id": "2p35fn", "body": "This \"problem\" is something I have noted for a while now, and I don't believe it is written about, or discussed enough as a real challenge facing people today.\n\nWe shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through Amazon.com and I think that is a problem.

I won't try to convince you that online dating is a good thing because I agree with you, that online date only really allows a small minority of very attractive (usually white, tall, skinny) people to get a ton of dates quickly.  However I think it's effect is overall a neutral thing, most everyday people who use online dating do it because they don't have many options in their day to day life and it's just something out there they can try.  \n\nThis problem is non-unique to a world with online dating.  It's always been difficult for hard working people to meet others for dates, hence all the different ways we have attempted to solve the problem over the years.  It's also often been really difficult to find dates if you don't fit the \"mold\" of whiteness, which includes being short (trust me I don't get dates either) or fat.  However this is also nothing new, unfortunately.  \n\nAnyway even though so many people try online dating I have found that most people still prefer to meet in real life if they can, and even if they only meet a potential date every two years that way,  I have found that that is *still* who they are more likely to end up with.\n\nIf online dating truly doesn't work for most people than it also doesn't alter the dating pool much.  I think the biggest issue is it can make you *feel* undateable because it certain increases the rate and volume at which you are rejected.  As long as you can see it for what it is, kinda stupid, kinda funny, then you'll be fine.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI really do feel you though.  Even though most women online won't consider a guy shorter them at least most profiles don't say that outright or specify a minimum height (although I do see this frequently).  However I am disgusted by the sheer amount of profiles that say \"would prefer own race.\"  Being part jewish myself I know this is partially probably a religious thing.  A lot of online daters are jewish as it fits with the culture of matchmaking and wanting to form a family around faith.

First and foremost, meeting people at a bar or at a park and going out on dates with them is still very much so an option. So any alternative to that does not create a barrier, but at worst can not open up new possibilities.\n\nHowever, let's say that there are serious barriers. You work an 80 hour week, and though you have a few close friends, you want a deeper relationship with a significant other. You could go the traditional route, which would be to go to bars, clubs, meetups, etc. Here, you would likely meet some new people, but few of them would be compatible with you, and you might miss the people you were most compatible with. Additionally, investing a large amount of effort with no return can be disheartening. So, if you work a lot, and in your free time you only have unfruitful ventures trying to meet people, you might give up.\n\nLuckily, there is a way to meet people who share some of your interests, you find attractive, they find you attractive, and both of you are interested in the same thing before meeting.

However, when you expand your pool such as through online dating, you're more likely to find someone who DOES find you attractive.\n\nReal life interaction is important yes, but online dating as the trigger to that is no different from seeing someone somewhere and saying hi.

But let me at least offer my thoughts, and I hope you'll take them as seriously as I give them.\n\n\nFirst, and I know this has been said numerous times in different ways already, online profiles allow users to filter the sort of attention they get. If I look at someone's profile for a few minutes, I can quickly determine if they have roughly the same dating expectations as me, if they have similar views to me, and if any of their interests line up with my own and would serve as a good starting conversation. I can also easily see whether they are seriously looking for a prospective partner or if they just set up a profile to see what happens. The \"what if\" profiles typically have about five minutes of thought put into them, with phrases like \"I don't know what to say about myself. Just ask me whatever you want and I'll tell you.\"\n\nTo me, all of that is valuable information when browsing someone else's profile. Similarly, I get to set up my own profile to attract people that value those things too. I don't have to rely on my profile picture and my demographics to perfectly match what someone out there is looking for, because I get to curate my image to present myself in a way that makes people want to get to know me. I'll admit I'm no expert at that. In fact, I probably have no idea what I'm doing. But I get to present my personality along with the hard facts, and I value that aspect of online dating.\n\n&gt; Its the pressure that online dating presents that I resent. People seem to always want to the next best thing and when you are in the dating stage, this fact kinda sucks.\nI as a normal guy can compete with 6'3 tall, white and handsome. So in the past maybe a woman would see where it might go with me, nowadays, pfft. Why bother. Her ideal is out there on okcupid, tinder, whatever and consequently, I am not even worth being considered.\n\nSecond, I get that it's frustrating to have that competition just a click away. In real life, you might be lucky enough to get a woman's attention and not have that 6'3\" white guy standing right next to you. Online, not only is the competition easily accessible, but they're active too. The impression I get is that lots of women who go on dating sites get inundated with messages and propositions of all sorts ranging from simple hellos and hookup requests to bizarre messages with no apparent (or sometimes threatening or offensive) meaning. And they also sometimes get attention from men whom they find attractive. The opportunity is there.\n\nThen you enter the picture. In your hypothetical situation, you already have the attention of a woman, and given no easily accessible alternatives she would date you and see what happened. I'm going to hope that you believe at least that part is possible and move on. From there, let's say this woman you've just met feels some sort of connection to you. Maybe you quoted a line from a song that she likes, or you said something nice when she happened to be thinking critically of herself. It doesn't have to be anything extraordinary, but she feels the joy of being on the same page as another human being, if only for a moment.\n\nWhy, then, would she continue to take any interest in you when that 6'3\" white handsome dude is right there, one click away, and eager for her attention? As far as you seem to believe, you couldn't possibly measure up to him, so why would she bother?\n\nBecause that connection means something. It doesn't mean she's in love with you, and it doesn't mean she has any commitment to you whatsoever. She might well go online searching for the perfect guy because that's where she thinks she'll find the love that will make her happy. But she could also stick around because that connection makes her want a little more. She could give you a chance because she's talked with a dozen guys who fit her ideal match but turned out to be the opposite of what she wanted or needed.\n\nI'll leave you with this: you may not be exactly what anyone is looking for, but that doesn't mean you're not worth finding. You, as a human being, are capable of forming meaningful connections with other human beings. Any detail that leads you away from that truth is a distractor. This may not mean much to you coming from a stranger on the internet, but you matter, so much.

Nothing cheap about that. In fact, about half the people I know who met someone on tinder for sex turned their *first* tinder hookup into a relationship. There is no way to take the human element out of dating, the websites just work more like a billboard to let you know who's available in your area.\n\nI also think you overstate how much it makes people replaceable. It's actually not much easier getting dates online than in real life; you have to invest time, concern, and effort into the conversation, and then have some sort of spark or connection.

The elements that attracted me to Tinder were:\n1. Cuts down on the wasted time/social tension as you immediately know if the other user is attracted to you or not\n2. Allows me to screen out individuals I would not date only because they were attractive physically by engaging them in conversation and providing a blurb about what they are looking for\n3. Enables those of us who would ordinarily not know how to approach an individual or be too shy/socially awkward to do so in a non-threatening manner.\n4. Makes it easier to meet people you may not have otherwise met or spoken to\n5. It is more acceptable on a dating site to ask someone directly what they want and what they are looking for, for instance I knew before I met my boyfriend that he was seeking a long-term relationship, is an atheist, would someday like to have children, etc., all of which were reasons I've previously had to end otherwise decent relationships.\n6. To want to be in a relationship, there needs to be some sort of physical attraction to the person, while this is subjective, I doubt anyone would even consider being with someone were there not some aspect they found intriguing or charming. \n\nLastly, in response to your assertions: if you're the sort of person who immediately abandons anything the moment it becomes difficult, then you aren't really seeking a relationship. If the person you're with is as readily disposable to you as a piece of clothing, the dating site has nothing to do with that, you must not think much of them in the first place. And if you aren't so passionate about your significant other that you delete your dating profile and lose interest in any other potential partners, then again, you probably shouldn't be a in a relationship.

While I do see people go on dates arranged through dating sites, I've actually never known ANYONE that got into a relationship, let alone had sex with someone that they met on OKCupid/Tinder/POF/Dating Sites. I'm certain that people do indeed pair off on these sites, and they do indeed have sex. But I don't think that is what these sites do for the majority of their users. (But hold onto that thought. There's something more important to be said first.)\n\nBut the first of two main points I wanted to make is that people that use Dating Sites are a self-selected group that are attracted to Dating Sites for the precise reason you seem to dislike them. It allows them to treat dating as a highly analytic, not a highly romantic process.  And for them, dating already WAS that, this is just a simpler, more time-effective way to process potential mates. If you took away dating sites, I think many of the users would still have a laundry list of checkboxes and must-haves, and must-not-haves that they would simply verify on the first date. If you percieve this as cheapening and commodifying romance.... that's fine, but I really think for people that love the analytic capacity of dating sites, they never put a huge value on that anyway. They were always going to look at it the way they do. Dating sites just make it obvious and easier.\n\nThe second point I wanted to make is related to my point about my friends not entering stable relationships via these sites. I see these sites as bringing my friends to events where they find people date, not finding people to date and then bringing them to events. For example, they make a date to go on a Wine Tasting with Joan, and they discover, oh my gosh, this is so much fun! So they go to more wine tastings and meet more people and maybe find a dating partner there. But it's not Joan. Or they go dancing with James and find out they love swing dancing. They end up joining that community and finding a mate.... but it isn't James. Really, my experience has been that people that find events and communities via these sites do well in dating, but not because they've found a main squeeze via these sites.\n\nI think it's important to note that people on these sites are not always looking for sexual or romantic relationships, so unless your argument holds up when changed to \"friends shopping\", you have some issues there.\n"}, {"id": "2p35fn", "body": "This \"problem\" is something I have noted for a while now, and I don't believe it is written about, or discussed enough as a real challenge facing people today.\n\nWe shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through Amazon.com and I think that is a problem.

Your friends are never permanent, I have friends who find Yoga friends on Craigslist because they have no one. Thats a great foundation for a lasting bond. Your TV, your house, your property, nothing. Plus, open relationship where you can fuck everyone and still claim love for one person, 'polyamorous' where you can fuck everyone and love everyone, non-exclusive meaning you like them and fuck them but they might not be the only one you fuck and a thousand other buzzwords designed for their destined unhappiness. Its like the curse of Capitalism. You need another one, replace it, get a new one. Everyone is almost bound to never be really happy because so much misguidance is pumped into the system with which people grow up.

On a dating site, you have access to other information that they've provided about themselves (through their profile, matching questions, etc), so you have some idea about how they feel about the world and whether or not you have common interests.\n\nIf someone goes into a dating site with the idea that they need to match a \"laundry list of required attributes\", then I'm going to put it out there that the problem is with their strategy, not with the dating site itself.  If someone is picky and shallow enough that they have a gigantic checklist, then you should thank them for filtering themselves out, because they're probably going to be obnoxious and difficult to live with.  If someone has a *small* checklist of important things and disqualifies you based on that, then there's a good chance that you're fundamentally incompatible anyway.\n\nThere's an interesting article about a guy who gamed OkCupid and collected a ton of data and then used it to construct an \"ideal\" profile for attracting the \"type\" of woman he was most interested in.\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/\n\nA lot of women actually contacted *him*, and he went on **87** ultimately unsuccessful first dates.  I mean, how hard can it be to hit it off with someone, really?  When he *finally* managed to have a successful date (that is, established a real relationship), he completely missed the obvious lesson.  On date number 88, he was *honest* with the girl he went out with.  Rather than trying to be a perfect \"checklist\" guy, he said \"fuck it\" and told her that he was doing an experiment and gaming OkCupid.  This instantly elevated him from a bland person in the crowd to someone who was actually *interesting*.\n\nYou shouldn't be trying to fit someone's checklist.  Be honest about yourself, even the things that you're not sure everyone will like.  Some people will be put off by it, but there's a fairly good chance that those relationships wouldn't have worked anyway (or, at best, would have been mediocre).  Those things that not everyone would like about you are the things that make you interesting and unique, and in my experience, they actually attract the attention of people who would have otherwise passed you by without a second look.\n\nTL;DR:  America's bad dating habits are in no way inherent or unique to online dating, however *having* those bad habits will certainly make your experience with online dating worse."}, {"id": "2p35fn", "body": "This \"problem\" is something I have noted for a while now, and I don't believe it is written about, or discussed enough as a real challenge facing people today.\n\nWe shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through Amazon.com and I think that is a problem.

You probably have, as [most of our daily actions are intrinsically linked to how attractive we perceive other people being.](http://facts.randomhistory.com/human-attraction-facts.html)\n\nNow, despite the prevalence of online dating in today's society, [meeting people through friends](http://healthland.time.com/2012/02/07/does-online-dating-make-it-harder-to-find-the-one/) is still the most common channel through which significant others meet.

Assume there is always demand for any number of units the company can produce, and that the company has a great brand and keeps the price the same, even if they make fewer cars. If in year 1980 a worker doing steel stamping is able to produce 100 cars per day, and the same worker doing steel stamping in 2000 is able to produce 200 cars per day as a result of his upgraded equipment, then should his real wage double?

The other company realizes they can get workers who are willing to work more cheaply, the wages converge towards each other.\n\nYou're arguing for a supply-side economy.  We currently participate in one here in the U.S.  Labor is abundant and jobs are scarce.  Employee protections are at their lowest point since the 20's.  Federal and Local governments seem to listen and cater exclusively to business interests in policy.\n\nAs such employers can use job scarcity and the threat of being fired to depress wages.  This environment produces the \"lucky to have a job\" sentiment which is channeled into discrediting pro-labor movements.  This is why you see so many negative attitudes associated with things like the fast food strikes.  And pro-business propaganda abounds.\n\nThe American worker is also in a wage competition with a brother/sister from India and China and Indonesia, etc.  Outsourcing is a multifaceted exploitation and the end result is a race to the bottom for labor.  That is to say \"which employee can we pay the least to do the same job?\" The minimum wage was created to prevent this exact circumstance.  Chris Rock made a joke about it; \"hey if I could pay you less, I would, but it's against the law.\u201d  Many people argue other \"Western\" countries don't have minimum wages.  That's true.  The part they leave out is those countries have strong labor movements and legal protections which render a minimum wage unnecessary.\n\nIf we continue the present course the end result will be economic collapse.  Our economy is structured around increasingly exploitative practices that slip more and more of the share out of the hands of the people who generate and stimulate that economic growth in the first place; the poor and middle classes.  Extremely wealthy people will have the means to escape.  Business interests can always find another market to exploit.\n\nGiven all this, do you think it unreasonable to pay employees more for the same labor?  It's a stranger telling you what your time is worth.  Time is the most finite of resources which means it is the most valuable resource.

Investment income is a reward for the contribution your capital makes to the production process, not a reward for taking on risk. Even if there were zero risk, you would still earn a return on invested capital, because capital contributes to production by enhancing the average productivity of labor. For example, US government bonds are generally considered to be risk-free for all intents and purposes, because the government can just take the money to repay them from taxpayers, but they still have positive returns.\n\nIt's true that investments with non-diversifiable risk tend to have higher returns, but that's because higher returns are needed to make it worthwhile for investors to take on risk.

It creates an oligarchy in the same way that people consider rich donors and current politicians an oligarchy - but instead of those having money, we have those with \"expertise\"\n\n&gt;There are thousands of experts in these fields that can actually put together workable long-term policies that actually make a difference, and aren't continually changed and overrided every time a new party takes over.\n\nDo you realize that government officials work closely with advisors and policy groups (e.g. think tanks) made up of said experts that create reports and guidance for policy votes?\n\nIn DC alone, there are tons of think tanks related to all sorts of public policy areas from transportation to military to energy to economics. They're filled with PhDs and other experts who take data and draft policy recommendations.\n\nJust because they have recommendations though does not in anyway mean that it is in the best overall interest of the country. \n\nThat's why we have judges in our court system and thats what our elected officials do - they take into account all the info presented to make decisions. Inevitably, some decisions are discarded because other information comes into play.\n\n&gt;I honestly cannot understand why we think elected people with no expertise can be put in charge of a certain part of the government they have little to no understanding of. \n\nThe President is Commander in Chief. Should we require all presidents to go through service in the military? Our Constitution clearly states that our President, a civilian, is commander in chief and thus we have civilian leadership of our armed forces.\n\nFact is, military experience - while helpful - is not a determinant of success in the job of being commander in chief. For every great president with lots of military experience (e.g. Eisenhower), we have shit presidents with lots of military experience (e.g. Grant) - we've had presidents do great in times of war without lengthy military service (e.g. Lincoln, FDR) while we've had presidents do awful in times of war with and without lengthy military service (e.g. LBJ).\n\nIn fact, LBJ's tenure is a great example of where the \"experts\" were allowed to run things - a major one in fact. The Vietnam War was conducted with experts like Robert McNamara and the Wiz Kids having made all the calculations needed to win the war - they calculated the bombs required to be dropped, the money and manpower needed, and even pre-determined bombing routes the AF was restricted to take.\n\nTurns out, they forgot the human factor and the other side's will to win. \n\n-----\n\nI'll add another point to all of this - in the military, leadership is not about being a technical expert. A large part about military leadership is about being able to take into consideration all the information available from your subordinates and choosing the best course of action and taking responsibility for said choices.\n\nAs an example, a General in the Army can come from a variety of backgrounds. Some started off as artillery officers, some as infantry, some as armor, etc. As they rise in rank, however, they become *generalists* - hence the term, *general*. A general isn't going to have the tactical expertise an infantry Captain has - nor is he going to have the supply chain expertise a supply sergeant major might have. Hell, a great historical example is Eisenhower, who never ever saw combat as an officer in his career.\n\nHowever, a general has to know how all his assets work together (his armored units, aviation units, infantry units, etc.), how they fit into the big picture (the divisions to his left and right or even politics), and make decisions dealing with the men and women under his command with the information he or she has available. Again, Eisenhower is a great example - he never saw combat, but he knew what his men were capable of doing and he was able to organize them and utilize them properly with the advice given to him by his advisors and subordinates. Often, he'd have to override experts in the field like Patton because Patton wanted to do something Eisenhower wouldn't allow, such as offend the Brits.\n\n*That's* the responsibility of leadership and that's why we elect officials to position of leadership."}, {"id": "2p2qgo", "body": "One thing that has always struck me as odd, even in a democracy, is how elected officials are allowed to complete override the advice of professionals in the subject they're making policies for.

The experts are there to make sure that a policy actually makes sense and will work. At the moment you can make a policy and completely ignore experts and advisors in the field. This would be in place to ensure that they can no longer do that. You're forced to actually work with them to make sure your policy will actually accomplish what it's intended to do. At the moment politicians have little if any accountability for this, because most policies do not directly affect the public (and hence the public won't know they're a bad choice to be in place)- but they can indirectly drain the economy, waste government expenditure, pollute the planet and do all manner of things that I'm sure the elecotrate would not want. It's a safeguard to prevent this, but it also exists to create a sense of continuity between the terms of the two parties.

In their own words, carefully chosen, this is why they formed the Confederacy (emphasis added):\n\n&gt;The ends for which the Constitution was framed are declared by itself to be \"to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\"\n\n&gt;These ends it endeavored to accomplish by a Federal Government, in which each State was recognized as an equal, and had separate control over its own institutions. **The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.**\n\n&gt;We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; **they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.**\n\n&gt;For twenty-five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now secured to its aid the power of the common Government. Observing the forms of the Constitution, a sectional party has found within that Article establishing the Executive Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.

Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. \n\n&gt; There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\n\nBut you can see it in other states. Consider [Georgia](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_geosec.asp):\n\n&gt;The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.\n\nOr [South Carolina](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp)\n\n&gt; We hold that the Government thus established is subject to the two great principles asserted in the Declaration of Independence; and we hold further, that the mode of its formation subjects it to a third fundamental principle, namely: the law of compact. We maintain that in every compact between two or more parties, the obligation is mutual; that the failure of one of the contracting parties to perform a material part of the agreement, entirely releases the obligation of the other; and that where no arbiter is provided, each party is remitted to his own judgment to determine the fact of failure, with all its consequences.\n\n&gt; In the present case, that fact is established with certainty. We assert that fourteen of the States have deliberately refused, for years past, to fulfill their constitutional obligations, and we refer to their own Statutes for the proof.\n\n&gt; The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\n\n&gt; This stipulation was so material to the compact, that without it that compact would not have been made. The greater number of the contracting parties held slaves, and they had previously evinced their estimate of the value of such a stipulation by making it a condition in the Ordinance for the government of the territory ceded by Virginia, which now composes the States north of the Ohio River.\n\n&gt; The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States.\n\n&gt; The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.\n\n&gt; The ends for which the Constitution was framed are declared by itself to be \"to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\"\n\n&gt; These ends it endeavored to accomplish by a Federal Government, in which each State was recognized as an equal, and had separate control over its own institutions. The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.\n\n&gt; We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.\n\nOr [Texas](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/2feb1861.html):\n\n&gt; Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated States to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility [sic] and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery--the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits--a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?\n\n&gt; The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slave-holding States.\n\nThese states seceded *explicitly* for the purpose of preserving slavery, and then banded together with one another to form a federation dedicated to the same purpose, and the confederate flag was its symbol.\n\n*Of course* their symbol is viewed as being racist.\n"}, {"id": "2p1uua", "body": "I believe that the Confederation Flag is simply a symbol of pride and appreciation for the Southern history and traditions.

To say that it meant that from day 1 would be contradictory. The flag was a symbol of secession, or treason against this union of states as well as the rebellion against a feared mandate against slavery. Even if you don't consider the flag racist, one should still consider it to be antithetical to American values, much in the same way someone waving [this](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSzPOwXEQvHSzJhMd2r_IiwClGEluFWUpV-OUEQ1l-mxnkuOFfYzT144jY) flag would be considered to be anti-American.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point. It really is painful to see many people who identify as Republican who display the confederate flag. Looking back in history shows that the Confederates were Democrats in rebellion. Republicans formed to fight slavery and many died for that cause, so it's completely backwards for a Republican even today to wave that flag, which used big government as an ideal to shackle people. Republicans are supposed to be against this, but wave a flag that promotes big government and the party they oppose.

Is this your claim?\n\nNo. My claim is simple. Try really hard to follow, because you're not making a strong argument and outside a lack of understanding I don't understand why you're so out of the ballpark.\n\n\n1.) Society needs an efficient police force, that is properly staffed and equipped. This is not optional crime, is worse than an under peforming police force. Period.\n\n2.) Police standards going up from where they are at, influences interest in the field, negatively. Higher standards make the field less appealing. No cops means society does not have cops to protect it from crime. Lack of cops, means that more crimes fall through the cracks.\n\n3.) The way you make people want to become cops, is by giving the field decent pay and job security. Personal interest helps, but a reasonable barrier to entry is really the way you improve your numbers. Higher pay, does not correlate with job security. Most people want a job, they know they will have through retirement, then a high paying job for a few years, unless it's so significantly high it rewards their time and capital investment into their education. Increased police scrutiny, makes these things go away.\n\n4.) At this point, someone could get into non-police work for more money and half the headache. A B.A. will run a person about $30,000 and 4 years of their time, with  the average compensation being between 30-60 grand a year. This also comes without the headache of being a police officer, and the lack of scrutiny. They simply do not have to deal with everything it means to be a cop, and they get the benefits a cop gets. Competitive pay, benefits the whole 9 yards.\n\nWhy would the general public want to be a cop, when they can go into work, make a comparable wage and never have to deal with the bullshit a cop puts up with?

I've read things about body cams, and increased accountability all placing a taller order for officers. Most of it to me, comes off as basic cop hating, and doesn't actually provide a reasonable solution that improves the amount of corrective justice taking place. In fact, it impedes the justice system because it introduces external hoops for police to jump over doing their job. My arguments are as follows:\n\nIncreasing police accountability increases police liability. In the era of social media, one bad experience can cost you your whole career. This is true for every job, BUT it's exceptionally true for police who on a day to day basis subject themselves to this form of public scrutiny. I don't see this going away under the current status quo, but I do think that adding more barriers to this particular issue destroys something the general populous values. Job stability. \n\n1.) Becoming a police officer like any other form of training is an investment, and the current state of affairs and the proposed state of affairs will diminish job stability for police officers. This results in a net negative in effective justice, because less officers means more crime. \n\n2.) It will create an upward trend in the risk/reward mentality. Due to their scarcity, cops will eventually lead to higher compensations to incentivize the fields. This is something present in other fields already where scarcity for the position exists, such as medical nurses having large signing bonuses. This leads to increased police spending for less officers, once again creating a net negative for justice.\n\n\n3.) The proposed things I've heard (such as maiming instead of killing and body cams) provide proper closure for a negligible amount of cases, but create far more gaps in coverage than they are worth. So it's logically inconsistent to say:\n\n \"Make cops more accountable, so we can have more true justice.\" \n\nRaising the liability of police officers, and destroying police coverage because of this ideology is not a positive boon to the justice system. Yes more high profile cases are covered better, but their frequency is too infrequent to justify the loss of police force. At which point if you insist on some of the measures suggested you are not for more justice, you are just cop hating.\n\nPlease CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "2p19c2", "body": "Obviously police reform is on the table right now in light of the past few weeks. I've read things about body cams, and increased accountability all placing a taller order for officers. Most of it to me, comes off as basic cop hating, and doesn't actually provide a reasonable solution that improves the amount of corrective justice taking place. In fact, it impedes the justice system because it introduces external hoops for police to jump over doing their job. My arguments are as follows:\n\nIncreasing police accountability increases police liability. In the era of social media, one bad experience can cost you your whole career. This is true for every job, BUT it's exceptionally true for police who on a day to day basis subject themselves to this form of public scrutiny. I don't see this going away under the current status quo, but I do think that adding more barriers to this particular issue destroys something the general populous values. Job stability. \n\n1.) Becoming a police officer like any other form of training is an investment, and the current state of affairs and the proposed state of affairs will diminish job stability for police officers. This results in a net negative in effective justice, because less officers means more crime. \n\n2.) It will create an upward trend in the risk/reward mentality. Due to their scarcity, cops will eventually lead to higher compensations to incentivize the fields. This is something present in other fields already where scarcity for the position exists, such as medical nurses having large signing bonuses. This leads to increased police spending for less officers, once again creating a net negative for justice.\n\n\n3.) The proposed things I've heard (such as maiming instead of killing and body cams) provide proper closure for a negligible amount of cases, but create far more gaps in coverage than they are worth. So it's logically inconsistent to say:\n\n \"Make cops more accountable, so we can have more true justice.\" \n\nRaising the liability of police officers, and destroying police coverage because of this ideology is not a positive boon to the justice system. Yes more high profile cases are covered better, but their frequency is too infrequent to justify the loss of police force. At which point if you insist on some of the measures suggested you are not for more justice, you are just cop hating.\n\nPlease CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
