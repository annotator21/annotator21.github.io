If the primary factor is class, and there are 2.7 times as many black people in poverty than there are white people, you would expect there to be 2.7 times the number of people in jail, right?  4.8% / 2.7 == 1.(7)%.  Given that the actual number of white people in jail is 0.7%, that means that it's about 60% lower than expected if race played no part.

I tend not to disagree with you that socioeconomic factors are primary drivers for crime rates (in fact, I've seen correlation coefficients between SES and crime rates of .48).  Moreover, I tend to empathize with police officers and their information processing paradigms.  From their point of view, African Americans perpetrate close to 50% of total murders though they make up 13% of the total population.  The intuitive construct that develops is to be more wary and suspicious of African Americans--when many of those cases tend to be validated by arrests, they become more confident in their opinions.  On the surface, it looks good for a classism, not racism argument.\n\nHere's where the nuance comes in.  The scope over which you've defined your view reduces the argument beyond a useful level.  In fact, one might argue that your scope is fundamentally at odds with your initial viewpoint.  If race is a critical or even pertinent issue to variance in SES between races, then it *necessarily* is a part of understanding whether or not race or class are germane to police actions.  In other words, your conclusion is that police utilize SES rather than race in their decision-making process.  This is only a valid claim if SES and race are independent.  If not, then thorough analysis of classism must also explain the racial bases of class difference.\n\nNow, I offer some food for thought; perhaps not to reverse your stated opinion, but maybe to make you think, \"Complicated, multivariate issues, don't have simple, reductionist explanations.\"  The stereotypes that many police officers (and other people) have for people of color have an impact on their interactions for which class cannot account.  One example is that African American men look older than the white peers.  Anecdotally, I can site the Tamir Rice case, but if you're interested you can do further research.  Another more pervasive problem is that black men are perceived as more threatening than white men, so situations are more quickly escalated.  Many counterarguments to his notion rest on blaming black culture, but a person shouldn't be responsible for making others feel less threatened by his presence (if he's doing nothing wrong).  \n\nFinally, I would posit that your argument is a better counterargument to the claim, police are racist than a well structured position in its own right.  In essence, your analysis effectively makes the argument that police (on average) aren't acting in an explicitly racially biased manner because they are are acting in a SES-biased manner, but your viewpoint fails to capture situational nuance in the same way that they position you're refuting does.  I would urge you to consider the value of positions that are less rigidly structured because they tend to be more susceptible to overconfidence bias are are less easily updated on new information.  They also discount the very real experiences of the people who feel that you're position fails to capture whatever critical elements or assumptions they are valuing.\n\nTL;DR--Read the four paragraphs above for a summary."}, {"id": "2oi4ma", "body": "FACTS: \n\n1.\t4.8% (0.7%) of black (white) people are in prison.\n2.\t27% (10%) of black (white) people are below poverty.\n3.\t13% (72%) of the USA is black (white).\n4.\tSumming the five most populous USA cities, 25% (44%) of the population is black (white).\n\nASSUMPTIONS:\n\n1.\tLow-income people are much more likely to go to prison than high-income people.\n2.\tCity-dwellers are much more likely to go to prison than suburban- and rural-people\n\nARGUMENT:\n\n1.\tAdjusting fact (1) for urban populations by correcting the numbers in fact (3) with those in fact (4), one obtains that 4.8% * 13% / 25% = 2.5% (0.7% * 72% / 44% = 1.1%) of black (white) city-dwellers are in prison.\n2.\tUsing fact (2), one would expect black people to be 2.7 times more likely to go to prison than white people.\n3.\tUsing argument (1), one observes that black people are 2.3 times more likely to go to prison than white people.\n\nSHORT-COMINGS:\n\n1.\tFacts (1) and (2), which are true nation-wide, are not necessarily true when applied to just cities.

So you buy cigs with what money you have, then sell them as individuals to other impoverished people on the street. You make some money doing this, and it's not a whole lot of effort, so you keep it up. Then one day one of those \"impoverished people\" is an undercover police officer. You don't have a license to sell tobacco products. BAM you now have a record. \n\nSound familiar?\n\nAnyway, the TLDR here is that I think the problem is it's a lot easier (though a lot more risky) to make money through illegal activities than it is through legal ones, most of the time. If you're desperate for money, do you do what's easiest or what's the most legal? This is the entire idea of the TV show breaking bad."}, {"id": "cmo3sgn", "body": "Absolutely.  It's WAY easier to make good money doing illegal things, but it's also WAY riskier to do so.  That's what prompts a lot of people to shift to illegal actions vs. legal ones.  The question we have to ask is, do we want the cops putting a stop to illegal actions, or not?  \n\nLet's take your example:  The person pushing cigarettes on the street.  There aren't many people doing that, because it's illegal.  Because it's illegal, it's good money, because most people don't do it.  If we tell the cops to back off and let them do it, suddenly there will be hundreds of people doing it, instead of just you.  Because they don't have to worry about getting caught.  Now instead of charging a buck a butt, you're forced to lower your price, because the guy a block away is selling them for fifty cents.  So you go forty.  He goes thirty.  You go a quarter, and now you're losing money instead of making it.  Then some other hustler from three blocks away gets sick of you two guys and your price war impacting his dealers, so he sends around a couple of chaps to explain things to you with a baseball bat.  Now you're in traction, and not making anything.\n\nHowever, let's say that same person gets a job instead, and makes seven bucks an hour pushing fries at a Mickey D's.  He realizes pretty quick that seven bucks an hour isn't enough to live on.  So he either goes for promotion, or gets a second job.  Millions of people do this all the time.  He works hard, gets promoted, gets a better job, and now he's making enough to support his family, and they are happy.  And he never did anything illegal.\n\nPeople who gripe about wages are griping about the wages paid in jobs that were never designed to support an adult lifestyle.  There's a reason why highschool kids work at fast food joints, and adults work in office buildings, or as managers, or shop owners and whatnot.  Some jobs support an adult lifestyle, some don't.  Forcing the small jobs to pay more will just increase the cost of everything, which will make the extra money you get paid useless.  Instead, people not making enough money need to get second jobs.  My mother did.  My father did.  I did.  My grandfather had THREE jobs when he was in his twenties, before he went into the military.  All of us went through the scrimp-and-save phase, and all of us promoted/got better jobs.  That's what we do.  We work hard and move up.  The higher up we move, the less hard we have to work and the better money we make.  To demand that young kids or folks that work low-end jobs get paid more is not addressing the problem.\n\nMany people would probably say that it's the lack of good jobs that forces people into bad ones.  I don't disagree.  We had the same thing when I was a kid.  That's why I had two jobs for a while.  It helped to support me when I moved out of Mom's house.  Even those two jobs was barely enough to survive, so I got a roommate.  Then it became easier, and I could work my way towards getting a better job.  I went from a store bag-boy to a stock-boy and then a department manager and then a store manager.  Moved up, got paid more.  Then I got an even better job somewhere else, and now I make a good living.\n\nAnyway, we're talking about something unrelated to the original point, but I just thought I'd weigh in with some wisdom born of experience and age.

I wasn't trying to make that argument. I was pointing out the mentality behind doing illegal things. Like you said, high risk, high reward.

I could go into greater depth, but the bottom line is that similarly poor families (the researchers looked at groups of unrelated people /cousins /siblings) produce radically different outcomes. There's something that goes on in *some* families (but not in others) when the kids are growing up that makes them prone to crime, violence and substance abuse later.

Why? Because they don't have the money to enjoy life or have fun like the middle to upper classes do. \nIf you have money there are so many more options to spend your time. For example go out for dinner, to the movies, travel and have, or be enthusiastic about hobbies. What is someone who lives paycheck to paycheck going to do with their time if they don't have any money to do responsible things? They'll get the cheap gram of weed, vandalise or just generally cause trouble since they don't have the freedom to enjoy finer things everyday. This also leads to a progession to a criminal mind as they see things like drug dealing as a great source of income whereas someone with a decent income wouldn't see it as worth their time.\nThere is also a maturity aspect because these people don't get the chance to take on mature activities and meet mature people. Therefore unless lower income people get an opportunity to become close with a more mature minded person, they will not get the opportunity to learn how to act in a legal way. This also considers a parental factor because if their household income is low, the teenagers to young adults don't have the opportunity to learn about the world like those with more money would. Because of this, the teenagers to young adults also only choose or have the opportunity to socialise with others in the same income bracket as anyone would prefer to be friends with those in a similar situation as themselves whether they are rich or not.\nYou also have to consider time as well. Someone on government support or working irregular and short hours a week has more free time than those who work full time naturally and therefore have more time for activities. However since they don't have money, again they commit crimes because of reasons I stated above. \nBasically police aren't classist, it is just the lower income classes that commit most of the crimes.\nI feel that the view you have is that other classes have to ability to bribe or pay out their way out of illegal situations. I believe this isn't true because why would people with money waste their time risking their comfortable lives for some illegal fun that they can replace with legal, responsible activities."}, {"id": "2oi4ma", "body": "FACTS: \n\n1.\t4.8% (0.7%) of black (white) people are in prison.\n2.\t27% (10%) of black (white) people are below poverty.\n3.\t13% (72%) of the USA is black (white).\n4.\tSumming the five most populous USA cities, 25% (44%) of the population is black (white).\n\nASSUMPTIONS:\n\n1.\tLow-income people are much more likely to go to prison than high-income people.\n2.\tCity-dwellers are much more likely to go to prison than suburban- and rural-people\n\nARGUMENT:\n\n1.\tAdjusting fact (1) for urban populations by correcting the numbers in fact (3) with those in fact (4), one obtains that 4.8% * 13% / 25% = 2.5% (0.7% * 72% / 44% = 1.1%) of black (white) city-dwellers are in prison.\n2.\tUsing fact (2), one would expect black people to be 2.7 times more likely to go to prison than white people.\n3.\tUsing argument (1), one observes that black people are 2.3 times more likely to go to prison than white people.\n\nSHORT-COMINGS:\n\n1.\tFacts (1) and (2), which are true nation-wide, are not necessarily true when applied to just cities.

Is your sister justified in being a dick to you about your friend if she doesn't like him?\n\n2. Is your sister justified in expressing her disapproval of your friend?\n\nRegarding 1, I wouldn't defend her bullying you for being friends with your cousin, because that's your personal choice and you can do what you want. Fundamentally, if you value your friendship with your cousin over your relationship with your sister, it's up to you to make that choice, and her trying to guilt trip you out of it isn't going to help you change your mind.\n\nRegarding 2, however, unequivocally, yes. There's some stuff in your post that suggests to me that you're being dismissive of your sister and her experiences, though I don't know why:\n\n&gt; She claims he is homophobic, racist, etc, and that he has posted hate speech openly on social media,\n\nWell, if he is homophobic, racist, etc., then that's just a statement of fact. You don't have to be offended by it; some people are proud to be racist and hate gays, and there's nothing saying you can't be one of those people. However, it is morally sketchy to be offended by accusations of racism and homophobia, yet continue to maintain friendships with racists and homophobes.\n\n&gt; but I haven't personally seen it although I know he makes a lot of jokes etc.\n\nThis is such a cop-out answer. If you really cared about racism and homophobia, would it take too much time out of your day to go on your cousin's social media and check? In fact, if you really wanted to consider your sister's point of view, as a gay person and as your sister, couldn't you simply ask her to show you where he's made the remarks that offended her? It seems that offensive comments about your friend bother you, but your sister's feelings, and the potential veracity of her claims, do not.\n\n&gt; I think her problems are due to her own issues, and its unreasonable for her to drag me into her own problems.\n\nWell, I'm sure most gay people's hatred of homophobes has something to do with the issue of their sexuality and how that's affected their lives. Does that mean they're not allowed to speak about it or try to change the world to fit them better? \n\nI think that, if you are a racist and a homophobe, you should let your sister know, because that will save both of you a lot of frustration and wasted time."}, {"id": "2ohzyl", "body": "Hey guys..

Mike made a friend in college that was sort of a deadbeat. We'll call him Dan. Mike bent over backwards to help Dan with a huge number of problems. In many ways, Dan was dragging Mike down, but Mike's a really good guy and was trying to help Dan.\n\nOne day, I finally just told Mike that Dan was not properly appreciative or even receptive to help and it was having a negative impact on Mike, stressing him out and causing him to waste untold hours trying to help a guy who wasn't making any forward progress even with all the efforts to help him.\n\nMike realized I was right and stopped putting in the effort to help, though that friendship hasn't ended entirely to my knowledge, the effort now stops at talking. Mike is a happier guy for it and much less stressed out. In fact, I'd say his stress levels have basically evaporated.\n\nI didn't really care much for Dan, but he had a pretty great sense of humor and a unique perspective on some fun topics. I, however, kept my mouth shut about things until I felt it was important for *Mike's sanity* to back off from Dan.\n\nIn short, everyone gets to choose their own friends. When one of those friends has a negative impact on your friend, it's totally legit to say something for the sake of your friend. The question in your case is about the reasons your sister feels the need to say something. Does she feel your friend has a negative impact on you, or is it simply that she finds him personally offensive?"}, {"id": "2ohzyl", "body": "Hey guys.. So this CMV stems from a family thing.

I just want people to know my way of viewing this, so they can adopt it, and stop wasting their time on things that don't matter. I have a really weird way of looking at insults in general. I think there are only two possibilities when it comes to an insult 1) it's bullshit. It's like someone calling Einstein stupid. There's so much evidence supporting the claim that he was a genius. So it's easy to disregard that insult as bullshit and not let it affect you. Or 2) it's true. It's someone calling you stupid, and you believe it to be true because the evidence supports it. It's something you already know and are insecure, and that person pointed out, and for some reason it hurts you. I think people should start using the truth as a way to better themselves. Someone calls you stupid and it hurts you? Good. Thank them. And start focusing on ways to better yourself. Few it as a critique in school. That person, although they are trying to hurt you, is actually doing you a favor. By allowing you to see what flaws you have, and now you can focus on fixing them. That's just how I'm trying to view insults. Yeah, it hurts. But it's my fault it hurts, because it's true. If I weren't pathetic or ugly, then I wouldn't have been offended. So I just need to focus on doing what I can to not be pathetic and not be as ugly.

You are making fun of someone for acting a certain way. How is that not also implicitly making fun of people who behave that way all the time? By making fun of someone, you are implying that the person is behaving in a manner that is not worthy of respect (since you would not \"make fun\" of someone who is behaving in a manner that *is* worthy of respect).

You may be right. But then again, most things aren't *inherently* offensive. In some cultures it's considered polite to avoid eye contact; in others, it's considered offensive.

In any case, I think it would be wrong to go to Japan looking people straight in the eye just because you don't think there's anything inherently offensive about it.\n\nSimilarly, what's considered offensive could be different for different *individuals.* You and your friends may find it funny to make fun of the behavior of the mentally handicapped. But for someone who has a mentally handicapped brother, your jokes could be seen as an implicit assertion that their brother is not worthy of respect. And for someone who *is* mentally handicapped, when they see you calling someone a retard, how are they supposed to feel about that? I would imagine that I would feel like a lesser human to hear such a thing. Would I be *wrong* to feel offended? Perhaps.

Why would I be expressing my thoughts on this if people already didn't think it was offense? All anyone seems to tell me on here is that people do get offended by it. Why do I need to change, when them changing would make the world a better place? If people didn't get offended at shit like that, if people didn't have to watch what they say. Every once and awhile people attack certain famous people for saying slurs. Alec Baldwin for calling someone who deserved it a \"cocksucking faggot\". I think Jonah Hill simply said \"fag\" or something. \n\nIt's stupid to me that people get offended when insults aren't targeting them. Insults are insults because it's telling someone they're something that they aren't. It wouldn't be offensive to call a gay person gay. But it is offensive to call a straight person gay. Because a straight person isn't gay. Does that mean the person using the insult hates the whole gay community? No! So why the hell are people acting like it.

English has a hard time communicating temporary and permanent states of being. \n\nI'm hungry is temporary. I'm tall is permanent. \n\nRetardation is a permanent condition. But if you are commenting on a person's actions or thoughts, it is not usually a condition of permanence. People do stupid shit. People think stupid shit. Calling them retarded is the wrong use of the word. \n\nThe only exception I see is if they're high in some way. If you say, \"you're retarded\", you're communicating that their current condition is restricting their abilities.  \n\nI think this is the reasoning behind the idea that calling someone retarded for doing stupid shit minimizes the word. Being mentally retarded is a serious permanent condition. \n\nI'll liken this situation to Tumblr's use of 'triggers'. Being Tumblr triggered by an Internet post takes the severity out of the word. I had to sit in on an incest survivors therapy group with my mom. I'd be in the back of the room on my gameboy, but I'd hear the stories. When these women's husbands would touch them they would have severe anxiety attacks. They usually cut the anxiety with illegal drugs, but now they're in recovery. This is the correct use of 'trigger'. \n\nYou're friend falling off the curb is not retarded. "}, {"id": "cmnw2nv", "body": "I think you just changed my mind on this, though I'm not the OP.

You're making fun of someone who is acting mentally handicapped, but CAN help it.

It's not offensive to children, because they can't help it. It's offensive to an adult because he's not living up to his potential. \n\nDoes that make sense? I've just never understood why people get so upset over that insult, or any \"slur\", really.\n\n Feel free to politely poke holes in my way of thinking. I'm just simply putting this out there as a thought, and I'm willing to hear your thoughts on the matter, and adjust my position accordingly. \n\nI have no idea whether or not this is 500 characters since I'm on my phone, but I hope it is. \n\n\nEdit: My view hasn't been changed.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2oj954/rconspiracy_users_should_be_aware_of_the_jidf_who/) is currently on their front page. It has over 250 thousand subscribers.

Regardless of whether I subscribe to those ideas.\n\nI disagree. They are racist and they perpetuate racist ideas. Reddit should inhibit that as much as possible rather than giving them a space to do their business. The reason being that racists shouldn't be made comfortable. I don't have any fancy philosophical arguments. It comes down to \"I don't like racists because they perpetuate hate and I think they should be shut off from mainstream areas and put in their own little secluded area of the internet, ie stormfront.\"\n\nI don't see it being that awful to enforce a rule \"no hate speech against protected classes\" and then enacting it. The south didn't explode when they started letting black people into restaurants. Germany hasn't broken down because they don't allow hate speech against Jews.

An example of this would be /r/mensrights. I believe that even though a large number of users there are sexist, the purpose of the sub is simply bringing attention to men's issues.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This viewpoint is flawed in that it restricts the freedom for everyone to have their own opinions/likes/dislikes. If you are, in fact, all of these things, there is nothing wrong with someone saying you are similar to most southerners and that they dislike people like that. \n\n**EDIT**\n(I felt that further explanation was needed)\n\nAs far as stereotypes go, they aren't altogether a bad or wrong thing. It is only wrong when you use a stereotype to judge someone before knowing if they fit that stereotype. The reason people often think that southerners are right wing, religious people with less racial tolerance than people from other regions in the US is because there are a significant amount of people from the south that fit this description. If you fit this description, there is nothing wrong with someone saying that you are similar, in a few key ways, to many other people from the south.

I am going to try to change your view!\n\nSo we all have limited resources, and there are many injustices in this world. Too many more, in fact, than our resources can handle.\n\nBy arguing that prejudice against and stereotyping of southerners should not be tolerated, you are suggesting that these limited and precious resources should be expended in an effort to correct that problem.\n\nPart of the prioritisation process should involve assessing the real consequences of continuing to tolerate that form of prejudice. You yourself admitted it is not even worth comparing to racism, for example.\n\nSince the widespread consequences of prejudice against/stereotyping of southerners are so much less severe than the consequences of other acts of prejudice, it should be low in priority. Therefore, in some circumstances, other forms of prejudice should be addressed in preference, and this particular form should be tolerated.\n\n\nBtw, I feel you totally. I have a conservative family who stereotype me as some socialist revolutionary purely because I don't exactly agree with everything they say. It is very frustrating to not get a fair hearing,and constantly be told what you believe despite the fact that you don't believe it.\n\nBut by comparison: I am also gay, and it is far worse to be told what They might think I am (sinful, promiscuous, mentally sick, etc etc) based on their uneducated and prejudiced views.\n\nSo, yeah...

So in order to change your view, do we need to make a case for prejudice being friendly and tolerable or do we need to demonstrate that the prejudice against southerners isn't that common/visceral/disadvantageous/etc? \n\nPersonally, as a somewhat liberal southerner without an accent, I've never felt victimized by any form of prejudice against southerners. So I think whatever prejudice there may be is primarily against southern culture and not individuals who live here or are from here. Secondly, I think that even if someone identifies with parts of Southern culture but isn't a tea partier, their political opinion is far less likely to be dismissed - so again the prejudice tends to be against a particular view than the place where it's from.
