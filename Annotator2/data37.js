Citizens United had sued to have Fahrenheit 9/11 found to violate campaign finance laws, but the film was found to represented bona fide commercial activity, and thus not be covered by such laws.\n\nWhere do we draw the line?  I could put together a movie with actual plot and themes and stuff taking place for an hour, and the other half hour is material to cut attack ads out of.  I could then run ads for the film which were, in effect, political attack ads.

In the only completely open, territory-wide elections in HK (the quadrennial LegCo elections), the pro-Democrats consistently win a majority of the popular vote, yet when the E.C. votes for the Chief Executive, over 80% of the vote usually heads towards the pro-Beijing candidates. If the E.C. was 'broadly representative', then there would be competitive elections for the Chief Executive between the two blocs. To date however, the closest election has been 2012 where the vote was split between C.Y. Leung and Henry Tang but both were closely affiliated with Beijing and carried 93% of the E.C. vote between them.\n\nIf you don't want to take my opinion and you think that this is simply a case of the West 'imposing its values', then you should look to the hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers (who are overwhelmingly Chinese) who protest every year against the unrepresentative character of HK's elections. They don't have a vote for the Chief Executive, they don't have a vote for the Election Committee and the vote they do have for the LegCo is undermined by a gerrymandered process that reliably hands a legislative plurality to the pro-Beijing bloc no matter what.\n\nIt's not just that the current constitutional framework is 'not representative enough', Hong Kong's political institutions are not representative *at all*.

This applies to all people, be they religious or not. If a person is desperate enough, they will cling to an idea and follow it as a means of improving their lives. Some people worship Gods. Some people worship Karl Marx. Let me take this point by point. I won't argue with you about the existence of God, but I will argue in favor of religion being allowed to exist.\n\n&gt; It's arrogant to think that your version of god is the right version when we've had thousands before; to believe the Bible and Christ you must dismiss all those who've honestly believed in Krishna and Buddha and Rah and Thor and Zeus...\n\nIs it any less arrogant to believe that one person's economic structure could solve all the world's problems? Or that one single man is the right person to run a country? Beliefs like that are every bit as pervasive as organized religion and they've been even more costly.\n\n&gt; It's about politics and power\n\nNot exclusively. It's also about people for searching for meaning in their lives, and justifying their societal moral codes. You'll remember that religious organizations account for some of the largest and most beneficial charities the world over, and while you can argue that people participating in those are only doing so to have a favor with the almighty, you can't argue that the results are a bad thing.\n\nIn any case, there are a lot of things that are about politics and power. Political parties are. Most companies meddle in politics and command a degree of power. Even systems of government ultimately exist to centralize authority and control people, often to the betterment of society. Would outlaw them all? By your definition, religion is at worst another tool people use to police their own behavior.\n\n&gt; God has been used to justify war, racism, slavery, genocide, misogyny, homophobia\n\nSo have economic factors, historical conflict, political philosophies and even love. Humans fight. It's in our nature. Religion has been used as a tool to propagate that, but even in a magical world where it was gone entirely, the conflict would remain. We'd just be inventing new reasons to have it.\n\n&gt; People do this cherry-picking, which should dilute any value of the religion; people steal lines out of context, interpret them as literally or non-literally as they so choose, ignore bits of the text and rules that they want to, and inject their own moral values\n\nPeople do that with everything. Cutting religion out of the human equation is just going to lead a different void that people will choose to mislead people with.\n\n&gt; People are afraid of \"cults\" but that's exactly what every major organized religion really is.\n\nPeople are afraid of cults because they're often fanatical and they break society's rules. I'll grant that the term \"cult\" is ill defined and often misappropriated, but you won't find a cathedral full of American Catholics willing to shoot up congressman's plane or commit mass suicide because a comet passes by.\n\n&gt; People try to use their \"religion\" as a scapegoat for logic, reason, and the pursuit of knowledge; i.e. american bible-belters fighting against evolution and science\n\nThey use politics for that too. The Affordable Care Act was proposed almost in its entirely by Republicans offering an opposing plan to Clinton's single payer initiative. But the minute Obama supported the same, it became the greatest threat to American civilization in our time. The majority of opposition to climate change science comes from people who have a vested political or economic interest in shutting down the findings.\n\n&gt; it becomes a self-applied label in order to legitimize your own ideology.\n\nSee political branding. Don't listen to that guy, he's a *socialist*. You should listen to me because I'm a *compassionate conservative*. People put labels on their bullshit and everyone else's. Again, you can't use it as an argument for banning religion unless you apply that logic to anything else.\n\n&gt; it goes as far as to try and tell you silly things like not to eat chocolate or pork or shellfish or garlic, or wear mixed fabrics...\n\nAnd we celebrate the freedom that the Founding Fathers gave us while selectively ignoring that they engaged in genocide against Native Americans and made African Americans 3/5ths of a person. Once again, selective memory is in our nature.\n\nIn short, religion makes a convenient bad guy because religious people can be obnoxious, they're super easy to identify and the lines between them are very clear. But the reality is that people can be stupid and nonsensical about any number of things. If defying logic gives a person hope, or makes them feel like they're going to gain something, they'll eat it up.

How does simply pretending the political spectrum doesn't exist help anyone. Yeah, you would probably get a better feel for the presidential candidates than without labels, but when making the most important votes, the ones for local positions like County Commissioner, Sheriff, certain Judgeships, School Board Member, and other assorted positions that directly impact your life you'd be completely lost. How much time do you have to look into the views and beliefs of the dozen or so candidates for Agricultural Commissioner? These labels are essential to working with people in reality, with a single word or two you get the gist (at the expense of some accuracy) of what it going on. Without the labels then we are all worse off. You can't just walk away from something of that kind of value.\n\nReligious organization does much the same. It makes it relatively easy to be aware and respectful of beliefs, like dietary restrictions. When I know I have a Jewish or Muslim individual over I will not serve pork. When I have a Hindu visiting I will not serve beef. It makes it easy for all involved, and diffuses potential conflicts, to be aware of such things before hand. Religious organizations of those traditions that insist upon hospitality and charity make it a lot easier to solicit donation, provide lower overhead costs, and get people assistance. It also makes it easier for community members to need help to find it and minimizes the role pride plays in preventing people from asking for help.\n\nReligious organizations are free associations of people trying to accomplish a goal. Even if, for whatever reason, all religious organizations would disappear tomorrow then we would simply see new ones form gradually over time the day after. People need to have a shorthand to deal with the expectations of others. If I feel as though have to perform a practice, and other people need to be aware of it, then I will have to have an explanation. If many people share the same need then they would form a common identity. The whole \"no religion\" thing would only work if you were to actually destroy religious belief, since religious organization is inevitable when belief exists in a free society.\n\nThis argument seem to strike me as more of an \"I believe that people in general should believe what I do and we should structure society to encourage that end\" than a fair critique of organized religion in practice. Of course you believe in what you believe in, and there are obvious benefits to having common societal structures and having your personal views widely held.

A more charitable view would be that religious leaders want to help people, not \"control their lives.\"  After all, being a priest or minister isn't a high-power, high-pay job.  Most people doing it are acting in a way that is very selfless, and describing them as universally power hungry is an unpersuasive and inaccurate stereotype.\n\n&gt;The scripture is man made, and man ruined; it was written by people 2000 years ago and spent the last 2 millennium getting copied by hand and translated and edited over and over and over to the point where how can we trust what the word of that original god and original text really meant?\n\nReligious people talk about issues of translation and manipulation of religious texts all the time.  Bible study and other such things regularly talk about how to look at the text from a lens critical of historical revisions and translation issues, etc.\n\n&gt;The scripture isn't meant to be read literally at all; people love to read you lines from scripture, and yet the tomes themselves are full of allegories, poems, hidden messages... how can you say one bit is any more valid than another?\n\nPeople use scripture mostly for inspiration or to search for allegories to their current situation.  You're seeing the subset of use in political argument, which I agree is usually manipulative, but are missing the majority of use which is much like citing to anything else (historical examples, literature, etc.) when looking to solve a personal problem. \n\n&gt;People do this cherry-picking, which should dilute any value of the religion; people steal lines out of context, interpret them as literally or non-literally as they so choose, ignore bits of the text and rules that they want to, and inject their own moral values... it becomes a self-applied label in order to legitimize your own ideology. People in the same church disagree on different aspect, people in different churches disagree, the religions themselves are splintered into different sects...\n\nPeople do this in every context though.  I've seen the same sort of thing done with all sorts of philosophical texts in my time in academia.  Lawyers spend their careers sorting through decisions cherry picking the arguments for their clients.  I don't see how this is religion specific.\n\n&gt;People are afraid of \"cults\" but that's exactly what every major organized religion really is.\n\nThat's untrue and a horrible stereotype.  Cults seek to isolate people from their social networks and make them live exclusively in contact with other cult members.  Its pretty easy to tell a cult from a non-cult.  Just ask if people maintain their social ties to non-members.\n\n&gt;People try to use their \"religion\" as a scapegoat for logic, reason, and the pursuit of knowledge; i.e. american bible-belters fighting against evolution and science\n\nAgain, this is stereotyping, you're essentially saying that religious people are either stupid or craven, and also extending a belief about one thing (evolution) to mean that they're totally against all science everywhere."}, {"id": "2onr1q", "body": "I'm here as a Secular Humanist, but I'm not here to argue about the existence of a God.

Maybe it's based off fear of the unknown, thirst for knowledge, something that your parents repeated to you after their parents had repeated it to them, or just a random construction of the mind that happens to be bestowed upon some people.\n\nHowever, it is necessary to understand religion (and later organised religions) to walk in the shoes of a faithful man. Someone who has faith will consider the existence of a (or several) god(s) as an axiom of our existence, as a *truth*. Not a scientific one, that can be explained with experiments and observation, but as an inner obviousness that shapes the world around them. It's something that you have to wrap your mind around when you argue about religion: the people in front of you believe in something, something important, and you don't.\n\nStarting from that, it is easy to see how a religion spreads: if someone has faith in the existence of a being, they will naturally be inclined to share that knowledge with their fellow men and women. Some of them might realise they feel the same way; some will just find comfort in the idea; finally, some people will use that faith to pursue a selfish end.\n\nYes, religion has been used by humans to justify war, racism, rape and genocide. Yes, the texts have been written and reinterpreted. But to a truly faithful person, saying that \"religion is used to justify rape\" is like saying that \"gravity is used to justify dropping atomic bombs\" (which is, if I dare segue a bit, something we, as a collective, did without any help from any religious denomination, thank you very much. No sir, those Japanese civilians died in the blast of a good ol' rational bomb!) or rather, that \"love is used to justify abusive behaviour\".\n\nComplaining about mankind \"using\" religion is complaining about the nature of mankind itself. It is our identity as a species to *use* our environment and to shape it with the tools we either were provided or created ourselves."}, {"id": "cmovhv1", "body": "And again, I'm not arguing against religious ideas and the faith in god, only in the disbanding of corruptible massive organized religious institutions."}, {"id": "cmovhv1", "body": "And again, I'm not arguing against religious ideas and the faith in god, only in the disbanding of corruptible massive organized religious institutions."}, {"id": "cmovs81", "body": "But you are, though: you assume that the two are independent, that faith can exist throughout mankind without shaping it. This is just not possible if you consider human nature. If you have humans that have faith and just do *nothing* about it, then whatever you have is not human. Humans create societies, communities, institutions because that's pretty much what they do. Most, if not all, of your arguments are actually very far from religion and could just be applied equally to governments: corrupt people who fill their pockets screwing the gullibles; power plays that dictate inane rules; cherry-picking and scapegoating, etc. These are things that are observed in all large-scale human institutions. Organised religion just happens to be one of those institutions, but based on faith.\n\nOr rather, I could just push your argument further and say that society as a whole is a sham: we have rich people fattening and poor people dying from hunger, we have thieves, murderers and lawyers, etc. But then your argument is against human nature and not against organised religion."}, {"id": "cmovhv1", "body": "And again, I'm not arguing against religious ideas and the faith in god, only in the disbanding of corruptible massive organized religious institutions."}, {"id": "cmpivdr", "body": "Religion may and can be corrupt, but what about literally every single government "}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2onp53", "body": "Typing this on mobile.

I feel like it is a parents right and responsibility to make important decisions for their child.

I would ask you, though, whether you think that *every* decision is a valid decision for the parents to make? If they decided to get their toddler a tattoo, would that also be within their rights, moral or legal? Would you support a parent's decision to put their baby on a vegan diet from birth? Or to *avoid* medical treatment in favor of prayer? Not every possible decision is one that the parents have a right to make.\n\n&gt;Because a child can't choose whether he wants to risk a dangerous surgery doesn't mean his parents can't make the choice.\n\nThis is also true, but again, it seems like you're assuming that *every* choice is valid. Would you support a parent's decision to get a preemtive appendectomy for their kid, even if there were no problems whatsoever, \"just in case something bad happens later?\"\n\nOr, perhaps a more relevant question: Would you support a parent's decision to have cosmetic surgery performed on their child, when there was no deformity that would make it necessary?\n\n&gt; It should be the parents right to circumsize their kid!\n\nI agree that circumcision isn't life-threatening or particularly dangerous. But does that give the parents the right to do it? Neither is tattooing, as I've mentioned above, and yet most people would be horrified by the idea of doing that to a child. \n\nNow that I've addressed some of your points, I'll offer my own opinion:\n\nCircumcision is primarily cosmetic. (There are a very few number of cases where it is medically necessary, and I don't believe that it should be prevented in those cases.) I don't believe that (short of some sort of major deformity) a parent should have the right to have cosmetic surgery on their child. I often compare circumcision to tattooing because the result is the same: No real benefit, just a cosmetic difference. \n\nTo me, it amounts to a few things that I have a major disagreement with:\n\n1) That a parent feels like they have the right to alter their child forever, specifically in a matter that the child *will* most likely grow up to regard as something their parents don't have any say in: their sex life. There is anecdotal evidence for and against, but the fact remains that the alteration of the sex organ is going to have an affect on the kid's sex life when he eventually has one. Think of it this way: Do *you* want your mother even *thinking* about your penis, how it looks, and whether or not girls will like it? \n\n2)This casual disregard for the child's future self indicates, to me, that the parent feels as though they have the right to treat the kid however they want. What I mean by that isn't \"raise the kid the way I want,\" but more along the lines of \"treat the kid like a housepet, in a way.\" The obvious similarity between cropping of ears or tails in dogs aside, it indicates that the parents feel completely comfortable changing something about their kid *just because they want to* and not for any strong, legitimate reason, regardless of the future adult's future opinion.\n\n3) The obvious argument against my last point is \"religion.\" While I can definitely see that as a strong reason, I don't believe it's a legitimate reason. Why? A) Because you're making a permanent, nearly unalterable, completely obvious modification to your child that will forever brand him with a symbol of your religion, whether or not he grows up to follow that religion. B) You're taking away his *choice* to demonstrate his devotion to that religion, if he does follow it. Does circumcision really indicate devotion, as it's supposed to, if it was done before the child was even *capable* of feeling devotion in any way? If it wasn't even the child's choice?\n\n3) Despite evidence that there are a few minor benefits--\"decreased risk of an already incredibly rare penile cancer\" tends to get brought up frequently--the benefits just do not provide a strong argument in favor of circumcision, and almost all of the supposed deficits of being uncircumcised also do not provide a strong argument in favor of circumcision. Phimosis aside (which is one of those medical exceptions I was talking about, but which is also frequently treatable via stretching instead of circumcision), washing the penis just isn't difficult, at all. A bit hyperbolic, sure, but I'd ask whether you'd want your arm amputated simply to make it easier to clean your armpit? No, of course, not. It's already easy to clean, you just need to lift your arm. Pulling back the foreskin requires just about as much effort as sticking your hand in the pocket of your pants. Not even tight pants, large hands, or small pockets.\n\nOverall, circumcision really has no strong arguments in favor of it. The arguments against it really don't hold up. The benefits just aren't there. Parents who do it to their child, with medical circumstances being exceptions, are doing it *purely* because they want to or because they are misinformed about the lack of the supposed benefits. They take a personal decision that the future-man should be able to make and take it out of his hands, and I find that absolutely wrong. I don't think it should be the parent's decision; it should be the doctor's decision at first (with parental input) and then the child's decision when he becomes an adult.\n\n\nI'd like to ask a question to the people reading this. Have any of you who are uncircumcised (or who have been uncircumcised) decided, or are in the process of deciding, to get circumcised? Why? I ask because I'd like some input; most uncircumcised men, when asked this question when it frequently pops up, would respond that they absolutely do not want to be circumcised.\n\n"}, {"id": "cmounxt", "body": "I'll address some of your points:\n\n&gt; I feel like it is a parents right and responsibility to make important decisions for their child.\n\nThis is true.

Millions of generations came before you and had it orders of magnitude worse.\n\n\nAs the ever wise Karl Pilkington says:\n\n\"Do yeh bit.\""}, {"id": "cmshqmh", "body": "It doesn't matter who came before in relation to shittyness. Think about it this way: Somewhere in China, some guy is making shitty toys for a couple dollars per hour. If you complain about your current job as a food stocker, people will mention this to you. The problem with this idea is that it's a global comparison. It assumes that people can be compared on the same scale. If all the people you know live in luxury and you're middle class, it's the same as if your friends made 2 cents and you made one. Regardless of the factual improved survival rates, perception is what matters. If I grow up rich, living poorly is much worse than growing up poor and staying poor.\n\n We, as humans, compare our lives to our immediate neighbours and our personal pasts, and not people from thousands of years ago. In this sense, Warren Buffet's relationship with one of his secretaries can be compared with Hannibal's relationship with a foot soldier. Even though the secretary's relationship is better off if considered mathematically, the soldier may have lived a happier and more fulfilling life due to the fact that his perception of his relative poorness is much lower than the attendant's.\n\nTL;DR The 'poor indonesian worker' argument is fallacied by assuming that you and a poor indonesian worker started at the same level playing field of life.\n\nhttp://www.poverties.org/absolute-poverty.html"}, {"id": "cmp46b2", "body": "&gt; That you enjoy. Not everyone enjoys that quality of life.\n\nI think if you look at the grand scheme of things, productivity as a collaborative effort by a capitalist society is incredibly efficient. Even the people at the \"bottom of the ladder\" (your wal-mart stockers, etc.) are getting an incredible bang for their buck compared to almost every human that has ever lived before us. In the super old days you'd be spending your time hunting animals for food wearing loincloths with spears and clubs that you made yourself, or more recently, you'd be spending dusk till dawn toiling away with real, actual, hard labor tilling your fields, planting your crops, harvesting them, milking your cows and that sort of thing, every day, for your whole life, earning nothing but the ability to continue surviving and working, hoping that by the time your body breaks down your sons can continue the work. Not that long ago you'd be working at digging a canal or boring a hole through a mountain for a train or laying down road with significant mortality and injury rates, and living in a temporary shithole with just enough money to purchase shitty food and shitty clothing.\n\nThese days you can spend a fairly easy, relaxed life, where perhaps you have to spend 8 or 10 hours of your life doing something non-strenuous like stocking shelves or serving coffee or entering data onto a computer, and in exchange for this relatively modest amount of labor, you can afford a place to sleep, food that is tasty safe and delicious, maybe a car, a phone which has access to the sum of all human knowledge, entertainment, access to health care and emergency care if you hurt yourself, vaccinations so you don't die of smallpox or polio or yellow fever or diptheria, safety from roaming bandits and outlaws, etc. safe drinking water that doesn't have to be hauled from a hole in the ground but is piped right into your apartment, meat that's been tested for safety and unlikely to kill you, etc.. Generally speaking, your life is incredibly easy: for just a little bit of unskilled labor, you can live a relatively comfortably life with the greatest problems being that of boredom or tedium (as opposed to being killed by a bear or losing your arm in a combine or to gangrene from when you nicked yourself, or even to going hungry or dying of consumption).\n\nOK, I'm sugarcoating it; certainly people growing old without any retirement income, or saddled with credit card debt, or raising a few kids while juggling a McDonald's job and a janitor job are not really \"having an easy life,\" but I think the general idea that work is a scam and you're enduring soul-crushing work to make somebody else rich is bullshit. Your work is **not** soul crushing if you have any kind of perspective on how hard people currently and previously have worked, and while your work may be making somebody else very rich, the compensation that you receive is still very, very good in terms of \"what you can get for the difficulty and effort of work you put in.\""}, {"id": "cmp6t97", "body": "Hear, hear"}, {"id": "cmoueym", "body": "&gt;  provide in some small way to the overall quality of life we enjoy. \n\nThat *you* enjoy.

Tech companies are especially known for poaching employees from their competitors. If the work you are doing is valuable, and your employer is underpaying you, then you will get offers from your employer's competitors. There are many cases where people will double their already considerable 6-figure salaries by jumping ship to a competing company. Even the average white collar worker can generally expect a 10-20% raise by jumping to another company (assuming they have no gotten significant raises in the past few years).\n\nThe way the labor market works, you are free to search for employment elsewhere until you find the highest bidder.  This is the employer who is willing to pay you the most amount of money for your work.  \n\nAnd here's the most crucial part: **The salary this employer pays you is exactly equal to what your time is worth.** This is such an important point!  If you were worth more, then someone else would be willing to poach you.  If you were worth less, then that employer would never have offered you that salary.  \n\nThe actual percentage of the value you capture for yourself is irrelevant, because that value only exists because you are leveraging your employer's brand name, distribution network, reputation, internal resources, etc, to generate that value. If you were to go out on your own, you wouldn't generate any of that value. This is why Tier 1 consulting companies can bill their clients $500-$1000 per hour and pay their associates $50-100 an hour or less. It's not because the company is scamming the associate, it's because clients are only willing to pay $500 per hour for brand names like McKinsey or BCG, and the wealth of experience those brand names imply. That same associate could not charge $500 an hour if there were operating as a one man shop... hell they probably couldn't even charge the $100 that BCG is offering on their own.\n\nIF that particular associate was particularly good at his job, AND his currently employer did not give him a raise, he would get poached almost immediately.

The basic imperative of life is don't die before you have kids that don't die before they can have kids.  If you manage to fit in some happiness in there so much the better, but it is not a requirement of anything. \n\nI can't think of a single thing that a human can do at this point in history that doesn't require the support of the system you despise.  That would include the  work that would make you happy.  This means that what ever work that may make you happy is possible because of the mindless misery of countless others.\n\nAlso consider that any possible system that could would make all people equally happy would also make all people equally miserable. If you live in a first world environment this happy state of equality would probably mean a net decrease in your present happiness.  "}, {"id": "2onhpz", "body": "I state the title of the thread for two reasons.\n\nFirst, work is spending the most valuable thing we have.\n\nFor the majority of us, work is something we do because we have to rather than because we want to. We do it to pay the bills and have food on the table. But that time we spent at work is time we'll never get back. It's lost and gone forever so if you spent 50 hours last week (48 working, two commuting) doing a job you find soul crushing, that's 50 hours of your life gone that will never, ever come back. And it'll be 50 next week, and the week after that, and the week after that...\n\nInstead of using that time to make yourself a happier, more complete human being you are spending it in service to someone else which leads to the second point.\n\nSecond, the work you do is generally making someone else rich. Working almost anywhere means you are working for someone else. Your salary is considered what you earned despite the fact that you may have been instrumental in generating exponentially more money than you took home for someone else. Your hard work is going into someone else's pocket and they're shaving off a few scraps so you'll show up tomorrow.\n\nSo, to summarize; work is you showing up somewhere to spend the majority of your waking day doing something you probably don't like and doesn't make you happy to fill someone else's pockets.

Rationality is not, by itself, an absolute scale on which arguments can be measured. What is \"rational\" or not is influenced by many factors, such as social environment and education.\n\nWithout dwelling in absolute relativism, it is impossible to define what is rational outside of the frame in which the argument appeared. It is often a problem encountered with religion, where people who do not have faith consider religion as \"irrational\" - whereas the \"argument\" of religion is formulated in a frame that includes faith and thus makes it rational from that point of view. You cannot say \"these arguments must reflect reality as closely as possible\" without assuming a certain objectivity to reality, and that is something that many people would disagree with.\n\nSo, arguments are, more often than not, only rational from one's point of view, and not absolute truths that stay true through any prism. The fact is that there are such arguments (killing without reason is bad, or something like that, on which pretty much everyone agrees), at which point they are not considered arguments anymore, but as tenets of our identities. Someone who disagrees with the above rule, for example, would be considered mentally unstable and would be dealth with by the means society posesses (law, ostracization, etc.). The statement is then not argued anymore, and very few actually reach that point.\n\nBasically, if you can still call it an \"argument\", then it cannot, it must not be considered perfectly rational.

It's better to give a poor family food stamps than deal with the expensive long-term societal costs of having kids grow up with rickets. Food stamps are cheap; imprisoning people who rob stores because they're starving is expensive. Providing medical care to low-income pregnant women and young children saves you money in the long run. These things are like oil changes for a car. Early maintenance is way more cost effective than treating a problem years later. \n\nAnd these drugs tests don't really test if someone is spending their food stamps on drugs. People on welfare can't afford drugs; even if you can find a way to convert food stamps to cash, the benefits aren't that high. They only give you enough to buy basic necessities; anyone relying on food stamps to eat who uses them for drug money will end up starving to death.\n\nThus, the only way someone on food stamps will likely use drugs is if they're given them by a friend. A friend realizes their buddy is on hard times, so they lend them a joint. That kind of thing. Generally, the drug use rate among low-income folks is a lot lower than that of those of higher income levels. \n\nSo, by doing this testing, you're actually costing society money in the long run. Welfare ultimately saves us money. Disbarring someone from benefits simply because they occasionally use pot removes this cost savings and results in higher long-term societal expense.

I understand the non effectiveness of testing welfare recipients, as many people have pointed out.  The view I'm espousing here is that if those welfare recipients should have to put up with the invasion of privacy, loss of dignity, and everything else that goes along with the drug testing process then why shouldn't everyone else?  \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Of course! and we take away all ambiguity on the matter by making it illegal. Is drug use wrong? If not, do what several states have done and change the law.
