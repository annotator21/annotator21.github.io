If your partner wants to change their last name to yours themself for whatever reason (doesn't like their name, bad family relationships...) then of course its different because it's their choice - as long as you'd be cool if they didn't.\n\n2. If you expected it on a very vague level of never thinking about it so you just naturally assumed it was what people did, I guess that is fine (even though I am surprised by not noticing the obvious unfairness), as long as after starting to question it you came to the conclusion it isn;t a fair expectation.\n\n\n3. I am not telling people what their criteria in relationships should be, or whom to be with. If you don't want to marry someone who won't take your name, that's your right, just as it is to have any condition you can imagine since the other doesn't have to agree with it. However, it is disrespectful. You might want to be in a relationship with someone you don't see as equally important as yourself, you may want your relationship to be disrespectful - all fair enough. My argument is simply that it is disrespectful.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nWell obviously, you are making an assumtion that your family name is more important than theirs. Name is a great part of identity to many people. You are saying they should change theirs to yours. \n\nYou want them to do something that you aren't willing to do yourself because you clearly hold yoursefl to a different standard. Now, sometimes two people do different things for each other because they have different needs, but that only works as long as it isn't based on one person actually expecting the other to do what they themselves don't want to but rather on the other wanting to do something they don't. \n\nFor instance, your partner is more social and always introducing you to people and initiating mutual friendships. You are not doing it for them. however, they do so because they want to. If they were to stop wanting to do it and you still felt you had the right to demand it of them, although you pefrectly understood why they would have a problem with it (you not being able to do it yourself), your demand would become disrespectful. \n\n\nA respectful partnership is equal - that doesn't mean both sides need to actually act the same, but they shouldn't be demanding things from the other that they wouldn't be willing to do themselves. \n\n\nThis demand especially, because it is so simple, is incredibly unreasonable and an offense to your partners whole identity. I can't see how anyone can disagree or excuse it. \n\n\nEdit: So main argument is \"it's tradition.\" Well traditions can be very unfair and sexist, and as far as I know, we don't have to follow them if there is no good or positive reason to. There is nothing sacred about tradition that somehow makes it above any other assumption of behavior.

If your partner wants to change their last name to yours themself for whatever reason (doesn't like their name, bad family relationships...) then of course its different because it's their choice - as long as you'd be cool if they didn't.\n\n2. If you expected it on a very vague level of never thinking about it so you just naturally assumed it was what people did, I guess that is fine (even though I am surprised by not noticing the obvious unfairness), as long as after starting to question it you came to the conclusion it isn;t a fair expectation.\n\n\n3. I am not telling people what their criteria in relationships should be, or whom to be with. If you don't want to marry someone who won't take your name, that's your right, just as it is to have any condition you can imagine since the other doesn't have to agree with it. However, it is disrespectful. You might want to be in a relationship with someone you don't see as equally important as yourself, you may want your relationship to be disrespectful - all fair enough. My argument is simply that it is disrespectful.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nWell obviously, you are making an assumtion that your family name is more important than theirs. Name is a great part of identity to many people. You are saying they should change theirs to yours. \n\nYou want them to do something that you aren't willing to do yourself because you clearly hold yoursefl to a different standard. Now, sometimes two people do different things for each other because they have different needs, but that only works as long as it isn't based on one person actually expecting the other to do what they themselves don't want to but rather on the other wanting to do something they don't. \n\nFor instance, your partner is more social and always introducing you to people and initiating mutual friendships. You are not doing it for them. however, they do so because they want to. If they were to stop wanting to do it and you still felt you had the right to demand it of them, although you pefrectly understood why they would have a problem with it (you not being able to do it yourself), your demand would become disrespectful. \n\n\nA respectful partnership is equal - that doesn't mean both sides need to actually act the same, but they shouldn't be demanding things from the other that they wouldn't be willing to do themselves. \n\n\nThis demand especially, because it is so simple, is incredibly unreasonable and an offense to your partners whole identity.

The hassle of having an overly long last name comes from formal systems that take time to change and have a variety of restrictions on name size. This can present as a name that overruns a text box and must be shortened or a computer program truncating the name. In many cases, this truncating is not checked for at later times, which can cause significant problems.\n\nAn overly long name is also unwieldy for introductions, whether formal or informal. Imagine someone who is a third generation of hyphenation spewing out nine names and you can see why the name *will* be truncated at some point.\n\n&gt; or to have to deal with a married couple who each have their own name?\n\nA family is often referred to in whole by the last name, which has the position of a familial name in popular discourse. This informs many systems. Most prominently, health workers dealing with heavy demands on their attention often use last name as a quick check for authorizing visitation rights. They really shouldn't, but the practice is fairly pervasive.\n\nSlightly less prominent but far more frequent is the use of the same metric in releasing children back to their parents. This generally only has to be dealt with once per care-taking organization, but it is a recurring hassle.\n\nSuch patterns are fairly common throughout our society, and will come up again and again. Considering that a name change is roughly as difficult to carry out as a change of address, the differing names have a slight edge in degree of hassle. When you take into account that the name and address change commonly happen at the same time, and with much fanfare, the hassle of differing names becomes clearly greater, requiring some kind of reason to choose this option."}, {"id": "cmjmqrm", "body": "Why does having different last names make anything more complicated?

So it's really counterproductive on multiple fronts - your disapproval is just going to make it less likely that someone will decide to change the course of their life. \n\nThis isn't even addressing the issue that some people are overweight because of other medical conditions. If you're on steroids to treat a condition that already limits how much you can exercise and move around, it's pretty much inevitable that you'll puff up like a balloon because of the water retention and the increased desire to eat the paint off of the walls. I ate about 1000 calories a day before I got sick, but when I was on steroids, I was waking up every two hours all through the night absolutely starving, and I'd vomit if I didn't eat. Of course I gained weight. I was in the \"overweight\" category for a few years because of it (before the illness, I was \"underweight\", so it was a pretty big change). The WORST thing about all of that was the comments from people who weren't familiar with my medical situation, suggesting I go to the gym and get some cardio in, because losing weight would make everything better. Well, yes, that would be nice, but I don't want to end up back in the ER. Thanks for reminding me that I'm fat and too sick to do much about it. \n\nThe entire approach to obesity in this country is problematic. If we have to go through a \"healthy at every size\" campaign so that people finally have the self confidence to be a part of society, then so be it, because it fucking sucks to be told that all it takes is some gym time to cure all your problems. Once you actually feel confident going out in public as yourself, it's a lot easier to make lifestyle changes that are both healthier and more likely to last.

Tobacco companies are forced to warn their consumers, they aren't allowed to advertise on television here in Australia and they have to now have plain packaging.The only real rule put in place in regards to food here is that McD's and co have to have the kilojoule/cal intake displayed. They are still allowed to lure people in through advertising and gimmicks.\n \nI get that a small percentage of people have weight issues no matter what they seem to do, but you can also get cancer without being a smoker, it doesn't mean you stop trying to get people to quit.

Control: The degree to which an individual has control over their weight varies. In the most concrete sense, certain physical conditions (thyroid, etc) can cause someone to gain or lose weight, regardless of how they diet and exercise. Mental health conditions can also lead to weight changes which individuals may not be able to combat due to disability. \n\n2. Fairness: Not every individual who lives an unhealthy lifestyle is going to appear fat. It is arbitrary to judge only people who appear fat visibly, and not all individuals who lead an unhealthy lifestyle. For example, I am 5'4, 20y/o and Female and weigh 95lbs. I swam competitively in college on scholarship (age 18), at at my peak physical condition I weighed 114lbs, with nearly no body fat at all - under 16 BMI. Compare that to the next year (19y/o) when I had not trained at all. I weighed 93lbs and had no muscle OR body fat. I ate &gt;2000 calories per day, most of which came in the form of carbs. Essentially, if I compare my healthy lifestyle with my unhealthy lifestyle, you can only tell a difference based on muscle. Even when I'm scarfing down McDonalds burgers and exercising nearly never, my weight actually drops. Many others are the same way - they lead unhealthy lifestyles, but they just don't end up appearing fat. My behavior was no different than anyone else's, it just doesn't manifest itself visually. It is not fair to judge people based on whether or not they are lucky enough for their bad habits to remain undetectable.\n\n3. Obligation: No individual is ever obligated to be attractive or healthy. I believe that people should be able to consciously choose to strive for health or attractiveness, and they should also be consciously able to not care about such things. If they choose to disregard attractiveness and health, then they cannot expect others to find them attractive or healthy. Yet, if someone is aware that they are unhealthy and unattractive and they are perfectly OK with that, why should they feel obligated to be attractive/healthy for your sake? \nWhat I'm asking is this: why would anyone in society be obligated to conform to your value system? why would anyone owe it to you to be attractive, or healthy? \nYou may value taking care of your body highly. That does not mean that everyone has to share that same value."}, {"id": "2o3isd", "body": "There is a lot going around the internet in regards to people being comfortable with their weight. While I think judging someone based on their weight is wrong, at the same time it's a good place to start. People I know who are overweight tend to eat unhealthy and not exercise.\n\nYou get bullied for being overweight? Go to the gym. Eat healthier. Put some effort in to taking care of your body. Not only will it boost your confidence, but you will feel better about yourself as a whole.\n\nI think sizeism shouldn't be a thing. Motivating people to go take care of their bodies properly should be instead. Go ahead, CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
