I'm an American, and I'm actually really interested in moving to Sweden, Denmark, or Germany -  preferably Scandinavia but your countries are harder to get into lol. Being pretty leftist for an American, I really have to admire your welfare system over there and how well run your country is. And honestly, I don't think that'd work very well here because this country is so huge and diverse. I think that being a more homogeneous culture with similar needs can help a lot in terms of the effectiveness of leftist economics, and it's reasonable to have some concern about immigrants coming in and being less capable workers due to language barriers and less access to education. \n\nHowever, I think the reason there's a taboo against xenophobia is because of the politics of it. Listen to the rhetoric of the sverigedemokraterna and how much it's based on irrational fear. The immigrants abuse the system! They're corrupting the children! Our culture is falling apart! And for some of them, there's actual hatred for certain groups, which is only natural when you fear them enough. And it's actually very similar in most xenophobic political parties in the world. \"Maybe if they'd do more to employ us Danes instead of making it easier for the immigrants to come in\", coming from the country with a very enviable 4% unemployment. \n\nJust don't let too strong an immigration policy be a detriment to your country. I'm studying to be an electrical engineer and I have a knack for learning languages. I'm already learning German and I'd definitely learn a lot of any country's language before I move there. I wound really love to live there and assimilate to your culture! It's a cool culture and worth participating in, and if someone moves there, they probably feel that way too, at least a little bit. And I've researched a bit about your immigration, coming from outside the EU/Norway is *very* hard, maybe hard enough to keep me out depending on what's going on in my life 5-10 years from now. You can have requirements for immigrants like C2 certified Swedish within 18 months of moving in without making it so hard to get in in the first place, and it's reasonable to require some means of assimilation without appealing to lies about what immigrants are like.

There is a very real social conception of better cultures and worse cultures.

It is not even an easy thing to decide if it is worth trying because it could seem that you are trying to pass a subjective off as an objective. \n\nfor example, if one where to make the argument that they should adapt to the local culture you have to make exceptions because White Americans don't have a native american culture and it is the same for Australia and South Africa.

I used to be the guy with dreadlocks who listened to rage against the machine. Every view I had was left/red. \n\nNow I no longer feel that way.

I've been trying to do the \"Swedish thing\" for the longest time now (I.e just live around the entire situation, not interacting with it). But work programs and other things just seem to force things. Previous workplace was the worst. Worked there for a year, and one in twenty immigrants knew English/Swedish and had zero interest in learning more (they were supposed to take days off to go to Swedish class, but this rarely happened).\n\nFor the record I am 24 tears old, a dude, and I do know that not all people of a group of people are bad.

To believe that a game should be perfect at release is a very short sighted ideal that should be reserved for rigid forms of media such as film. Because of the nature of game development the best experiences are only created through excessive (and often expensive) testing. If you want a perfect experience from day one simply do **not** take part in pre-sales. If you expect a perfect experience, you are narrow minded and are forgetting one of the key qualities which make the medium of video games so admirable: **adaptability**.

Find some solid foundation and values to work with, and try and build something from that. That'd be my advice.\n\nAs for my personal experiences, I personally was suffering from manic-depression and anxiety issues at the time, and looking at the other comments that might be a problem in your case too. I'd recommend not giving up on anti-depressant medication- it took time but it did wonders for me. \n\nBut it was also just kind of, living life I suppose. Doing my best to live life and try and think as positively as I can about it- acknowledge the fact that I may die someday, and be scared of that at times, but try to not let that fear consume me. \n\nI'm honestly not sure that I can give you any great advice about this, unfortunately, because it was really a personal revelation and there wasn't really a knock-down logical argument that persuaded me or anything.

Nothing is forever. Everything ends. Me, you, the planet, the cheesecake in my fridge, the sun, the universe, everything. Time itself will end and then there will be nothing. Nothing is forever. And it doesn't matter. All that matters is now, because I won't be around to experience later.\n\nSo I realized, fuck it. I'm gonna be dead one day, but I ain't gonna be alive to know it. I'll be dead and no longer able to produce a biological response to external stimuli. And that's all pleasure is, really. Whirligigs in your brain pumping out chemicals. I don't know if there's any meaning in that, but I do know the meaning of something is not contingent upon its permanency.

The reason we need to laugh and smile and love life is because it ends. Because all good things end.

But surely *East of Eden* is still a good book despite it ending, while Twilight could continue on a thousand more pages and not be good or worth it. Just because things end doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy them. Lots of things end- books, songs, movies- but that doesn't mean they are meaningless and futile. They clearly have impacts and so can you as a person, your life can still be wonderful and meaningful even if it doesn't last forever.\n\nAlso, your outlook on life does not seem healthy- I recommend you seek a professional's health and I was to leave with a quote from the great Doctor- Seuss\n\n\"Don't cry because it's over;Smile because it happened."}, {"id": "2pcwpg", "body": "Everything is just a reminder of the futility of life.

And everyone else too.  And everything is destroyed.  Already -- everyone and everything -- all gone.  But, hey, here's one more minute to enjoy and to preserve my peace of mind.  Cool.  \n\nIn fact, being dead is liberating.  No more pain, misery, guilt, fear, anger, annoyance, impatience, irritation, struggle, need, want, injustice, unfairness, or anything else to resist, judge, overcome, or act against.  Just eternal and peaceful sleep.   Nothing better than peaceful and dreamless sleep.  So, if you consider yourself already dead, these life-draining/energy-draining conditions of life can diminish or disappear altogether.  \n\nAnd, in any case, I was dead for billions of years before I was born and I'll be dead for billions of years after I die.  Death/non-existence is the natural condition.  Life is ephemeral, transient, trivial, unreal, and illusory.  But it can be enjoyed or it can be resented.  It can be paradise or torture.  Choose which viewpoint works best for you.  Both are fake in their essence.  \n\nMeanwhile, the energy that makes up \"you\" is just a temporary alignment and configuration of energy that has existed since the beginning of time and will exist forever, so, to that extent, the components that make \"you\" are eternal.  Before you, they were various components of billions of other forms, including trees, rocks, insects, animals, cleopatra, Shakespeare, and an infinite number of other things and people.  And, after you, they'll go on to be components of future things and people.  The entire universe is just one thing -- a gigantic recycling machine so that every component  is constantly changing, moving, dissolving, and combining.  But, then again, the entire universe, including the component called you, might be an illusion, especially if the universe is a holographic universe.  \n\nSo, all this is to say that we know nothing.  We don't know death or life or conditions or anything else in essence. We only have guesses and limited choices.  But, all things considered, the only logical and sensible choice is to consciously/deliberately accept and enjoy every minute of this transient, temporary, illusory, and meaningless existence.

You might find you don't need some grandiose way of looking at life in order to enjoy it - take the reins and make it your own, so to speak.\n\nYou won't get answers, but its not about \"getting an answer\", it's about what you want to do versus what you're doing. If there is a conflict then something, for lack of a better word, is wrong. It's exactly the difference between logic and rationality, and at least to me, the balance of the two is what it is to be a person nowadays.

There are a shitload of doctors out there who will have pet drugs because reps give them stuff, and there is a lot of bad info out there. There's also a huge element of trial and error in that particular field because the mechanisms for these drugs aren't fully understood. A decent doctor is aware of this and works with it from the perspective of \"medicine as a last resort\" if that makes sense.  Usually folks come off that kind of medication within a year, but some don't. I still experience the same symptoms off meds now that I did when I first took them about twelve years ago. For all I know its a kind of self fulfilling prophecy at this point, but yeah, it works. I still try going without every few months, but as of yet those feelings still come back, albeit in a week or two as opposed to the very next day like it used to be.\n\nIn my case, it was that I had extreme apathy and a horrible temper. I preferred to sleep because it made the time pass faster; I was effectively waiting to die, when I didn't have the feeling of just wanting to do it myself (that happened a lot too). I also became furious over the smallest annoyances, to the point of breaking game controllers and shouting at people on a fairly regular basis. The difference with medication was not that those feelings didn't occur at all, it was that they didn't dominate my perspective constantly. Losing a video game still made me mad (dark souls, I'm looking at you), but I don't get the urge to chuck the thing through a window like I used to. \n\nIt may very well be a complicated placebo, but hey, I'd rather that than what appears to be the alternative.

It's familiar territory and comforting to know that everything ends, even the universe will suffer entropy. But I am unique.

Philosophy doesn't make bread but it can be a waymaker. Good philosophy should be concerned with life, and everything from Nietzsche onwards deals with the kinds of questions and answers that our lovely OP is trying to deal with: the anxiety and dread symptomatic of modern life. Most of us, by the very virtue of being in this thread, have felt the concussive effects of being plunged into a world without God. Life becomes meaningless, man becomes piss drops in the wind, time stretches endlessly. It happened to me in high school as I became affiliated with Camus and Samuel Beckett. The awakening into the philosophical landscape--bleak as it may be--happens, inevitably. It faces us all and some are lucky enough to be merely entertained by the idea and continue on, but others struggle. Here I reminded of Heraclitus: \"The human, in the silent night, lights a light--himself.\" If that doesn't sum it up just about as well as it could, I don't know what does. I'm young and have very only recently entered into any kind of dialogue with the history of philosophy. Absurdism still tugs at my back pocket, but, willing or not, I am still thrust into the future. Existential questions are here to stay and will never leave, but what I hope for, in your searches, is that you come to some point of convergence in the manifest fullness of human experience. Like I said, good philosophy is concerned with life (and forgive me but I am only going to quote continental philosophers from hereon in), and good philosophy thrusts our own questions back onto us: Nietzsche asks us what our choices in life mean if they are perpetually weighted against the immensity of infinite time; Camus demands of us to fight as hard as you damn well can to carve out the enclave of your meaning; Heidegger asks you if you are living authentically; Gadamer reminds us that the hermeneutic circle of understanding is positively unfulfilled. This is not /r/GetMotivated[1] [1] brands of shenanigans but questions that reach out beyond themselves and grip you tightly. If you are to lose your naivety, you are to grasp the yoke yourself and engrosse yourself completely in the complexity of your life and the infinite horizon of meaning and experience that lays before you. I hope that your existential quandaries lead to nothing less than all-out assaults on the \"humdrum\" of life. If you are to take existential philosophy seriously, you have to consider its questions from the helm of Being--you. Good luck! Edit: I meant to respond to the top comment.

For instance there are many happy people living in third world nations in absolute squalor, who have lost those close to them in war and tragedy, who literally could die of disease or war at any moment. At the same time we see people living kush lifestyles on easy-street in perfect health who commit suicide because they are, it seems, unredeemably depressed and are for whatever reason unable to find joy in anything, even with everything at their fingertips.\n\nYour feeling that \"everything is just a reminder of the futility of life\" and that \"the journey is just a distraction that the end is meaningless\" is nothing more than a particular perspective and worldview, one shared by a minority of people.\n\nWithout even touching on whether or not death actually IS the end it seems like it would behoove you to change your perspective. You say that you can't enjoy anything because you \"know that all things come to an end.\" \n\nThere are 4 options.\n\n1. All things come to an end. You believe this and you are right. You go through life joyless and it eventually comes to an end.\n\n2. All things come to an end. You believe this and you are wrong. You go through life joyless and die but it's not the end. You went through life joyless because you held a false belief that you couldn't shake.\n\n3. All things do not come to an end. This would be a change in your perspective and now you enjoy life, since what is holding you back from enjoying life, by your own admission, is that you \"know all things come to an end\". So you believe this and you are wrong, as in reality maybe all things do come to an end. You go through life able to enjoy things and then your life ends. You held a false belief (everyone holds false beliefs), but had a more enjoyable life because of it.\n\n4. All things do not come to an end. So in this last scenario this is correct. You enjoy life and die or whatever but it's not the end.\n\nSo what does it take to change your perspective? I would say it starts with a little bit of humility. Maybe you are wrong about \"all things come to an end\". If you can entertain the notion that your beliefs, even your deeply held beliefs, even things that you think you \"know\" are incorrect I think you will be able to find a lot more joy out of life. \n\nThere seem to be two paths that people usually take to resolve this issue. One is the \"well it's all meaningless in the end so might as well enjoy it\". Some people have suggested that. The other is to deny that it is meaningless, or at least to entertain the possibility that it is not meaningless. I think the second approach is better, but again you have to be open to acknowledging that you might hold beliefs which are incorrect, no matter how logical you believe yourself to be. Acknowledge that there may be things you don't understand and other things that your are forever incapable of understanding. That is humility.\n\nSo where others have tried to change your view by suggested that, knowing what you know, life can nonetheless be enjoyable I think a better route is to call into question what you think you know. If you don't \"know\" that all things come to an end, there is no reason for such a belief to hinder you from enjoying life. Maybe it is the case that death is the end. Maybe it's not. You don't have access to that information as you've never experienced death. All you have ever experienced is life. Make the best of what you do experience and don't worry about what you haven't experienced."}, {"id": "cmvluuu", "body": "&gt;Life is just a series of replacing old goals until you die...\n\nHave you considered that you could be wrong?\n\nIt seems evident that one's contentment/joy in life, more than any material success or comfort/ease of circumstances, is the perspective an individual brings to the table. For instance there are many happy people living in third world nations in absolute squalor, who have lost those close to them in war and tragedy, who literally could die of disease or war at any moment. At the same time we see people living kush lifestyles on easy-street in perfect health who commit suicide because they are, it seems, unredeemably depressed and are for whatever reason unable to find joy in anything, even with everything at their fingertips.\n\nYour feeling that \"everything is just a reminder of the futility of life\" and that \"the journey is just a distraction that the end is meaningless\" is nothing more than a particular perspective and worldview, one shared by a minority of people.\n\nWithout even touching on whether or not death actually IS the end it seems like it would behoove you to change your perspective. You say that you can't enjoy anything because you \"know that all things come to an end.\" \n\nThere are 4 options.\n\n1. All things come to an end. You believe this and you are right. You go through life joyless and it eventually comes to an end.\n\n2. All things come to an end. You believe this and you are wrong. You go through life joyless and die but it's not the end. You went through life joyless because you held a false belief that you couldn't shake.\n\n3. All things do not come to an end. This would be a change in your perspective and now you enjoy life, since what is holding you back from enjoying life, by your own admission, is that you \"know all things come to an end\". So you believe this and you are wrong, as in reality maybe all things do come to an end. You go through life able to enjoy things and then your life ends. You held a false belief (everyone holds false beliefs), but had a more enjoyable life because of it.\n\n4. All things do not come to an end. So in this last scenario this is correct. You enjoy life and die or whatever but it's not the end.\n\nSo what does it take to change your perspective? I would say it starts with a little bit of humility. Maybe you are wrong about \"all things come to an end\". If you can entertain the notion that your beliefs, even your deeply held beliefs, even things that you think you \"know\" are incorrect I think you will be able to find a lot more joy out of life. \n\nThere seem to be two paths that people usually take to resolve this issue. One is the \"well it's all meaningless in the end so might as well enjoy it\". Some people have suggested that. The other is to deny that it is meaningless, or at least to entertain the possibility that it is not meaningless. I think the second approach is better, but again you have to be open to acknowledging that you might hold beliefs which are incorrect, no matter how logical you believe yourself to be. Acknowledge that there may be things you don't understand and other things that your are forever incapable of understanding. That is humility.\n\nSo where others have tried to change your view by suggested that, knowing what you know, life can nonetheless be enjoyable I think a better route is to call into question what you think you know. If you don't \"know\" that all things come to an end, there is no reason for such a belief to hinder you from enjoying life. Maybe it is the case that death is the end. Maybe it's not. You don't have access to that information as you've never experienced death. All you have ever experienced is life.

But ultimatly they are very closely related as you'll notice.\n\n\n&gt; Everything is just a reminder of the futility of life. Having a good time with friends becomes loneliness. Drinking and kicking back is just a distraction from the end-all that is death. Another birthday is just another year towards the end. Life is just a series of replacing old goals until you die...\n\nYou have to ask yourself what death is. Imagine going to sleep and never wake up. (spoiler) [This implies a new question](/s \"what was it like to wake up after having never went to sleep (birth) \"). You can't have an experience of nothing. The only experience that can happen after you are dead, is the same sort of experience as when you where born. \n\nDeath presents the opportunity to understand completely what life is all about, by letting go. From your standpoint in that position in that time you understand why we die. To give us the opportunity to understand what it's all about.\n\nIf death could be indefenitly postponed, we would not actually go on postponing it indefenitly. Because after a point we would realise, that isn't the way we would want to survive. The process of life is far more amusing to be continued trough different individuals, than it is with the same individual. Life is renewed with each new individual, you can remember how fascinating the most ordinary, everyday things are for a child. Because they see them all in a way that is not related to survival and profit When we start to do that, the value of most things cease to have magic. Once we have ceased to see magic in the world, we are no longer fulfilling nature's game of being aware of itself. There is no point anymore, so we die. And so something else comes into birth with a new view.\n\n\n&gt; For example, You aim to graduate high school... but then you have to make a new goal, so you aim to graduate college... but once you're there, you get a career, and then a family, and a home, vacations, etc. The journey is just a distraction that the end is meaningless.\n\nYour reasoning is on the right track, but you forgot to look past it. I agree that the journey, in a way, is a distraction, a hoax. Wherever you are at a point in life, you'll always feel the same as you have always felt. The problem is, this is not what naked life is, this is culture. You are always trying to make new goals, always living for somewhere where you aren't. There is no use planning for a future wich when you get to it and it becomes a present, you won't be there, you'll be living in some other future wich hasn't yet arrived. You can't live at all unless you can live fully now, in the present. The future is only a concept, don't let it ruin your journey.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2pcwpg", "body": "Everything is just a reminder of the futility of life.

You're right. \n\nIt is meaningless, purposeless, and after death (assuming the whole transhumanism thing doesn't pan out, tbd), you will eventually be forgotten. \n\nIn opposition to many of my fellow atheists, I also agree that death doesn't add to life, but detracts from our enjoyment from it. It's a burden. \n\nSo lets say that's all true. So what?\n\nTrying to find meaning I think is the real red herring. We've been raised to ask 'what is the meaning of life' as if without having such a meaning, the life we are living is just a shadow or a charicature of 'real' life. \n\nBut the fact of the matter is that 'real' life is akin to commercials who interview 'real' people or seeing pictures of 'real' people. \n\nThe problem here is we have an evolved sense of 'essense' which is 'imbued' into things. Like when one asks 'what is the essense of true sport' or 'we are imbued with a special unique spark', but these are magical thoughts. Things just are as they are, and looking for 'meaning', 'purpose', 'essense' or 'realness' is the problem. If we get all tangled up in the false assumption there are such things, that itself is the ultimate distraction. The ultimate lazyness. \n\nI sometimes tell people the shocking fact that 49% of american school children are performing below average. But of course, 49% will always perform below average because that's what an average is. So what's the bug in our klugey brains that gets most people to find the 49% fact unbeleivable? The same thing that makes people say 'people are so stupid nowadays' when in fact people are signifigantly smarter on average than just 100 years ago. \"Why is the world going crazy?\" is another one in an age of unprecedented peace, stability, and economic prosperity worldwide. There's a 'magic world' we all have this gut instinct to think things 'should' be like. Where there are no parking meters and relationships are easy. \n\nTo expect 'meaning' is to invite your brain to start lying to you...and it will happily oblige. \n\nBut if we can lie naked on the cold obsidian floor of this uncaring universe, close our eyes, embrace the horror, and then stand up and fill the days available to us with experiences we prefer, then we can posses our days. See the complexeties, richness, love, mistakes and lessons, successes and hubris and grow and learn and be vulnerable and embrace the run as it happens, then we can make the most of it all. \n\nLove is real and imperfect, pleasure is real and imperfect, accomplishment is real and imperfect. And all are available to you.\n\nThe end is going to, in all probability, be psychologically horrific and physically painful. And that's an awful thing.\n\nThere's an old fiction trope where, when everyone realizes the world is going to end in 30 minutes, they all just start taking drugs and having orgies. Might as well make the most of it, right?\n\nSo, what's the difference between 30 seconds and 80 years? the time to enrich your experience finding things that are even better than orgies, or heroin. Peak experiences, sublime art, hard work and accomplishing goals. \n\nIt's not about whether you'll regret wasting time in the end, it's what you do until then for the sake of those moments themselves, and if the world you leave behind is better than the one you were born into, because the experiences of those people you share time with, and those who will stay after you, or arrive after you're gone, are just as real as yours. \n\n"}, {"id": "2pcwpg", "body": "Everything is just a reminder of the futility of life.

They are American Spanish language TV channels, and they have two of the largest audiences of Spanish-language television viewers in the world. They have Spanish sports broadcasting, reality shows, telenovelas, news, etc. I'm not sure what their reach is, but I live in Houston, where there are more Hispanics than Caucasians, so maybe that's why these TV channels are more accessible/cheaper than basic cable.

You not only have Spanish programming, but also: English-speakers watching Spanish programming, a variety of people with different cultural backgrounds on shows like Modern Family, and shows on American channels featuring minorities like you described, such as Black-ish. /u/cold08 says it best, even Black-ish is a show about \"how restrictive a cultural identity can be than it is accepting the differences.\" (I'm not a huge fan of the fact that you used it in your argument but haven't watched it.) \n\n\nIn addition, your response comments in this thread have said: \n&gt;I actually have a slight interest in watching it now.\n\nand\n\n&gt; I agree, I do tend to watch shows that are heavily dominated by white men in positions of power\n\nWhich brings me to my final argument: more diverse shows are actually not wanted or needed.

Something I think most people outside the development sector are unaware of is that every peacekeeping op *has* a mandate. UN mandates aren't just for the UN itself. The mandate of a peacekeeping op is necessarily mutable; every PKO has a mandate specific to the conflict to avoid what the development sector calls cookie-cutter solutions. Thus, force in defense of the mandate can very specifically be allowed in a PKO. Recent examples include MINUSCA, Mandated to protect civilians and support transition processes in the Central African Republic. Its website lists \"the protection of civilians as its utmost priority:\" a mandate which allows force. This is considered a Chapter VII mission in that under Chapter VII of the UN Charter it can authorize force and is both a PKO and a peacebuilding op. [This](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusca/mandate.shtml) is MINUSCA's mandate if you are interested.\n\nBecause it is not only a PKO but also a peacebuilding operation, it has other tasks, including support for the transition process; facilitating humanitarian assistance; promotion and protection of human rights; support for justice and the rule of law; and disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation processes. This is also taken from the website.\n\nThus, you can see that your point 4 in fact reinforces the argument that a PKO can be authorized to use force, not that it shouldn't. \n\n&gt; 2) The current solution is not working. The UN does not have a good reputation as it is, and it is not worth the risk to further besmirch their name\n\nregarding point 2, an interesting article you might want to look into is \"The UN Record on Peacekeeping Operations,\" published in the Summer 2007 *International Journal* by Michael Doyle and Nicholas Sambanis. This article looks critically at the record of success of UN PKOs. Contrary to your point, they conclude that more often than not, UN PKOs are successful in fulfilling their mandate, especially in countries with low levels of development and high levels of hostility. I don't think it's accurate to say \"the current solution is not working\" when clearly PKOs have a high rate of success and mandates to use force, unless you are referring to the UN as a whole.

However like all governments if it is going to survive it must demonstrate it can operate effectively.  The points you list are absolutely correct but also demonstrate that the UN has no moral courage.\n\nThere are certainly situations in which a global body to negotiate world wide treaties (instead of a billion treaties between each and every country) is beneficial.  For example international mail, laws of the sea, international shipping regulations, etc. could all be negotiated and settled by the United Nations.  However there is really no need for a standing body to do this.  The UN could meet every few years, hammer out a treaty or two that last a few hundred years until they have to be changed, and let that be it.\n\nIf they are going to meet regularly and discuss the issues of the day then active genocide must be the most important issue they face.  This is where they can really show people the world over that global governance is important and desirable.  So that when a country fractures along religious, ethnic, or class lines and one side tries to wipe out the other the UN can step in and put a stop to things.\n\nNow this is just my view.  I am sure there are people out there who are eager for the UN to start passing international regulations so everyone uses the same kind of electric grid and I don't need an international power converter when i travel.  But to me having a global government that is going to stop ethnic cleansing is really what I want.\n\nAnd for the reasons you set out in your CMV I think the UN is absolutely reluctant to actually step in and be offensive in order to fight genocide.  And if they are unwilling to be offensive they are always going to be ineffective.  More than anything though I think that is the peril of moral cowardice.

If so, they'll probably settle into one sexual identity to seriously identify as once they've tried on some of these new labels for a while.  So you might be right to suspect that these tumblr labels are a fleeting thing.  But that doesn't make the act of trying on these labels any less important or serious, in itself.\n\nI would've *loved* the term \"genderfluid\" if it had been around when I was younger.  I'm pretty much just a regular straight cis woman, but hearing this term now, I think it might have helped me make a lot more sense of my slightly unusual interests, which were very hard for my younger self to classify or make sense of in the context of being \"just a regular straight cis woman.\"  \n\nSince I never heard of any term like that growing up, I still had those unusual feelings like I wasn't quite normal, but I was left just wondering *why* I had such a passionate interest in androgyny or cross-dressers, or any fictional story that involved someone passing as a different gender.  It wasn't like I was actually gay, or even trans, since I had no interest in actually altering my gender.  I liked having my female body, I just liked acting and dressing more androgynous, or slightly masculine.  And it's caused confusion for my significant others in the past.

If 2 women go out and have sex with gay men, does that mean that there are now 4 families? And who decides for the children, the mothers, or the fathers?

Everything surrounding gender is a social construct - but biological genders (Male and Female) are required for the continuation of the human species.

Keep in mind that these aren't new genders, just new identities. \"Boy\" and \"girl\" carry a lot of weight in how people treat you, how you perceive yourself, and your mental well-being. Your friends are having trouble with the concept of simply being \"boy\" or \"girl.\" They may find that they identify with one more than the other, despite their assigned sex. Maybe they don't feel that they fit into either one.\n\nDespite what you may think, tumblr isn't some plot to turn people queer. It's a community comprised mainly of young people who are still learning about themselves and (for most) are in one of the only environments where they can openly discuss their identity.
