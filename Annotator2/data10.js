They are getting easy sentences."}, {"id": "cmwifqx", "body": "My point was not to say that the incarceration gap is insignificant, only that women do not gain from it.\n\nI think it is different because the end of the wage disparity is a concentration of a limited resource along gender lines, women making less money does mean that men will have more money. More money accumulated for men means less available for women (or how it should be more accurately broken down in the places redditors are more often), all the higher paying jobs are given to men and women are stuck with lower paying jobs. In the case of the wage disparity there is interplay. Again I don't think this equals some structure built especially for men (privilege) so much as a \"normal\" baseline built with the preclusion/restriction of women.\n\nIn the prison example less incarceration for women does not require more incarceration of men. These phenomena are not comparable in the way you are trying to compare them.\n\nI am not denying that the disproportionate incarceration of men certainly hurts men, this is very much related to a bunch of shit things about being a man; we can say the prison system hurts men more than it hurts women, but that does not mean that women are gaining anything as a result of this.\n\nImma go back to the dog on the leash analogy. If one dog is on a shorter leash than another dog, the shortness of one leash may be a result of the owner thinking one dog (maybe it is a rottweiler) will be more dangerous because BS breed preconceptions (aka dog racism), but the teacup poodle on the long leash is not to blame for the short leash of the other dog.\n\nThis is a different situation when competition for a scarce resource enters the mix. If a bowl is put out for the two dogs and the teacup poodle eats 3/4 of the dish, it means that the rottweiler will only have half a meal and the teacup poodle is an asshole.\n\nNow, this isn't a perfect metaphor because we need to remember that wage disparity and sentence disparity are experienced uniquely by every person differing over time, there is no neat \"bad dog\" to blame in either scenario.\n\nYes, many men will not experience being barred from whatever job they want because of gender, something more women are likely to experience, but here is where the \"not all men\" phrase is useful. Not every single man will gain from this, the man who gets the job because of his man-ness is gaining from his man-ness, the ideas that cause this sort of thing to happen cause them to happen over and over and that is when we get a wage disparity, it is not tidy in terms of what is to be done, and blaming every man for the hiring practice of a law-firm or something is goofy.\n\nSo exactly why this is and how the dynamic perpetuates is hyper-obscurant for both situations; over-incarceration of men and lesser-employment of women are both problems that cannot be solved unless everyone involved is willing to stop their sexist preconceptions.\n\nTL;DR: I never said that the incarceration disparity doesn't matter/doesn't exist, only that it doesn't amount to a gain for women.  A woman being granted a shorter sentence does not require a man have a longer sentence. A man making more would require someone else to make less, as an aggregate that someone is more often a woman than not. \n\nMoney and prison time are not limited resources in the same way."}, {"id": "cmxd2bg", "body": "I don't know where to reply since this is directed broadly, I think this is a good time to bring back what I was trying to say before the first sentence of my initial comment became the only thing discussed.\n\nThis debate about whether or not something is privilege is a waste of time and I've drawn myself into it. There is a thesis I should have put more clearly (since our discourse has made a superfluous intro sentence into the sole focus of the debate). I'm not super familiar with this sub so if I owe someone a delta for this please let me know.\n\nThe point I should have stuck with from the get go is that privilege only exists in moments where there is a gain for a person as a result of an identity, it cannot exist within a vacuum. A person may have a gain from being a man or being a woman in one situation but that does not transfer to the rest of their moments necessarily. There is not a \"Male-privilege\" there are an all but infinite number of situations favoring different men at different times that get crammed together and called privilege. But abstract privilege is not a good enemy for us to make non-abstract advances, the actions, moments and thoughts are the enemy. This theoretical constant identitarian \"Privilege\" is an illusion.\n\nCalling something privilege, in its contemporary use, is vague to the point of uselessness. Yes individuals gain and lose based off of their gender, but we need to remember that privilege cannot be uniform if the gender experience is not uniform (which it is not). So we can say a man or woman is privileged in a situation where they gain because of gender but trying to extrapolate that into a constant and omnipresent \"male-privilege\" masks how gender actually affects us.\n\nGender disadvantage for women is not something that can or should be justified by pointing to disadvantage in men; this is the sort of binary privilege politics sets up through the \"oppressor\" v \"oppressed\" rhetoric. Is the civil rights claim of gay cis-people invalid because, by certain metrics, trans-people have it much worse? Of course not. The oppositional nature of contemporary identity/privilege politics makes us create opposition where there is none and that is problematic. Men and women are not opposed in essence, they may not have an essence, but restricting action based on gender provides for unequal power relations which causes the opposition.\n\nThis is why gender problems must be investigated on a smaller scale, on the microscopic level. Gender restriction is how gender is enacted in a real sense, not a magic privilege you get because of genitals/whathaveyou. If we want to work against gender restriction for any gender then we must examine what we the restrictions actually are. You can't fight an idea but you can work against anyone who acts dis-favorably because of or in perpetuation of the idea.\n\nSo, does the fact that many individual biases have stacked up to produce the statistic OP is brandishing be actually, meaningfully, extrapolated to a larger uniform privilege that can be applied broadly? Well, doing so makes it appear that women as a whole are doing injustice to men as a whole, which is not even close to what is going on.\n\nA pattern from repeated observation is a useful scientific/predictive mechanism for prediction of how the future is likely to occur because of the past, but the prediction will be limited by its framework. The prison disparity seems like an affront to men broadly when seen as a statistic, but it is not, it is an affront to the men sentenced to greater jail time because of gender. It is also not a boon for all women, it is only a boon for women who receive shorter sentences because of gender. This is not a uniform \"women's privilege,\" no such thing exists. It is an \"amalgamation of the incarcerated women who got lesser sentences privilege,\" and even that is over-broad, the only way to avoid a loss of important nuance is to examine the microscopic, the individual moments of gender determining action.\n\nSo if we do want to talk about privilege we can, but we need to recognize that it doesn't really exist, it is a (semi)useful fiction, not a reality.\n\nIf we really want to investigate gendered incarceration we should start from the bottom up, like science is supposed to. Rather than looking for a gender division and then, finding one, claim that abstract gender is the mechanism through which men wind up with more jail time we should be looking for patterns within prison populations. This way when we find that men are incarcerated for longer we can see that it is a result of unfair treatment by the state, not unfair treatment by women or abstract privilege. We can see that the opposition is between the men prisoners and the sexist state, not between men prisoners and the \"fortunate\" woman prisoners. And it is certainly not between all women and all men."}, {"id": "cmwgtd5", "body": "This is going to be long and weird but I don't agree with you and here is why:\n\nMen being put into prison for longer does not benefit women, but it does hurt men. If we imagine prison sentences to be harm, which you assume in your argument, then a man being harmed longer does not cause women to have shorter sentences. Locking Harry Potter under the stairs wasn't what gave Dudley (that's his cousin right?) his good life, but it is what deprived Harry of his. If we want to try to make a privilege argument we need to find a case of gain rather than less harm, in my opinion.\n\nNow, we could start stacking up anecdotes against each other arguing about why some phenomena show men gaining from gender/women gaining from gender; but I don't think this is a productive way of looking at gender.\n\nPhrasing sexism as a homogenous force across society acting exclusively to the benefit of men and to the determent of women is absurd, we can see examples of sexism against men harming effeminate men, coercing men to act \"manly.\" This can be seen as sexist (or whatever, depending on how you want to use the word sexist), but once again this doesn't establish privilege for women.\n\nThe debate often comes down to anecdotes and to various scientific studies proving whatever either way about a small milieu of the broader sexism debate (like prison sentences) and none of them seem to go any way toward building an concrete and singular idea of what privilege actually is.\n\nWhen we look to these little bits we miss the bigger picture, but when we look at the bigger picture we miss the smaller bits. The puzzle doesn't quite fit. I think that is because we are looking at the whole in the wrong way, sexism is not a puzzle of smaller pieces fitting neatly together to form a standard of sexism across society.\n\nSexism is an amorphous ever-changing theoretical concept made up of themes we see within repeated actions, experiences, opinions, norms. If something sexist happens it can be traced to a decision made by a person, not the magic sexism ghost, so we have to say that whatever bigger sexism there is comes from people. However we cannot ignore that people's sexism comes from the sexism they grew up with, the bigger sexism. This odd cycle shows that there is an ever-changing discourse between the actions and images we see and the ideas of gender we have, we see that sexism exists in moments, events, not floating in space. No two events are ever exactly the same, so how can we pretend that there must be an essence to sexism, something we can call a constructed privilege.\n\nBut what is there to take from this flim-flam? Sexism is in a sexist action, a sexist thought, a sexist policy, a sexist post on reddit, and on and on, one thing sexism isn't, is floating in the ether. Gender and the way it works is not as simple as men gaining from women because the specter of masculinity wills it. It is the actions of individuals in conjunction, the repetition of images, ideas, jokes, and on and on. Gender restriction is everywhere, but it is not the same anywhere, it is contingent on situation and cannot exist in a vacuum.\n\nMen are not singular or homogenous, and neither are women. Our politics of see gender as constructive and that is a problem. Gender is seen as this structure built up to give men more, but this is only the case relative to what the structure allows women. Gender is not positive, gender is a restriction, it does not build for men, it just tends to take away from/restrict women disproportionately. \n\nTo me this means we shouldn't look at gender as a palace of masculinity built up to help men, instead we can see how men appear to benefit because gender hurts women and we can see how women appear to benefit because gender hurts men. In this whole mess no one is privileged, some are just hurt more than others.\n\nWe shouldn't ever be looking at gender as something which can be entirely known, it is something that is constantly changing, it is amorphous, it doesn't really have clearly defined lines. It is wobbly. \n\nThis means that the enemy of those who think men are put in prison for too long should not be women, but should be the people who actually created the situation. As so the enemy of feminism should be the perpetrators of sexism actions, events, statements, et cetera, not a completely amorphous and incomprehensible ball of jumbly gender norms (not to imply all feminism is the latter). \n\n**TL;DR**: Ain't nobody privileged by gender, some people are just restricted more than others by it. The dog with a long leash is only privileged relative to the dog on the short leash tethered next to it. The enemy when acting against gender restriction should be thoughts, actions, et cetera that are dis-favorable, people who have internalized sexism into their normal actions and so on. This does mean \"all men\" have something to work on because of the unavoidable sexism/gendered restrictions that become part of our experience, but it also means all women and everyone else do as well."}, {"id": "cmx29ab", "body": "We might just as easily say that women are harmed by sexual violence, but women being raped doesn't really help men.

Any decent linguist will tell you that these are important differences.\n\nAnother problem is who is *judging* how well certain beliefs fit that definition. For example, take affirmative action (applied to the sexes). It is a program designed to influence hiring in favour of women *due to a perceived inequality*. Sounds like it fits the definition. But, by definition, it is *applying* an inequality between men and women. So is this activity feminism (grounded in equality to men) or furthering female self-interested privilege (grounded in bias in favour of women).\n\nThat's just a mild one. What about things like the right to wear what you want -- even \"slutty\", revealing clothes -- without being shamed. When somebody applies it to women, it seems to fit that definition and is a good thing. But when those *same people* undermine the massive accomplishment of a scientist by shaming him for what he is wearing (which would never be tolerate in the reverse case), is that feminism or self-interested female privilege?\n\nIt's easy to put things *in terms of* that definition and yet still be entirely sexist through rationalization. For example, Matt Taylor's shirt was \"objectifying\" women, and that is offensive to women and creates inequality against women, therefore the criticism is warranted. But men being offended by women's clothing and making them cover up, well, that's patriarchy and inequality against women too.\n\nThe problem isn't the definition. The problem is that you can take just about any given situation and spin *both sides* to fit it. Women doing A and men B, you can argue A is promoting equality and B is patriarchy, then switch it to men doing A and women doing B and now A is patriarchy and B is promoting equality. That's the fundamental problem with \"means many things to many people\", I think.

Women get an unfair advantage here, but OVERALL in our society they're still the victim.  I'll give an example of the point I'm trying to make and it'll be an extreme example, but I'll just make it to prove a point.  Imagine a house where there's a white parent with a white child and an adopted black child.  The parent regularly torments, mocks, and abuses the black child while being kind and caring to the white child.  However the parent occasionally lets the black child sleep in longer than the white child.  Beating the black child while loving the white child is inequality.  So is letting the black child sleep in longer.  Is the \"same thing\" happening to both kids?\n\nI'd argue this is true of sex relations in our country as well.  We live in a patriarchal society in which men have the overall advantage, so in an individual case where the men in control favor women, the big picture is still one of women being oppressed, just like the overall picture in the hypothetical house is the black child being oppressed.\n\nWomen don't have privilege for the same reason the black child in the hypothetical story doesn't have privilege.  \n\nIn some ways it is a semantic argument.  But if you appropriate a term initially developed by others (in this case, by sociologists) you ought to use the term as originally intended.  \n\nI do agree that if we follow down this road we'll probably just talk past each other, because we're operating with different definitions of privilege.  \n\n&gt;I mean I'd love to discuss the patriarchy but that's irrelevant here. My CMV is that the same thing happens to women and when the same thing happens you call it the same thing.\n\nMale privilege comes from patriarchy.  Therefore it's relevant to my argument that what women experience is not the same at all.  Where does \"female privilege\" come from?  If a patriarchal society in some specific cases grants women preferences, I'd argue that's not the \"same thing\" that happens to men who benefit from being in a male-run, male-controlled society full of male-dominated institutions and professions."}, {"id": "cmweimw", "body": "&gt; By using the same term you downplay or deny the fact that massive sex-based disparities still exist in our society, and that our society remains a patriarchy.\n\nLike I said, \"Disclaimer: I'm one of those nuts who think men and women both have privileges and oppressions.\"\n\nI really feel like there's a difference between \"men are in charge\" and \"the ones who are in charge are men\".\n\nAnd I feel like I saw you coming when I drafted this CMV because I added, \"This is a double standard that does a backflip over facts and turns \"women get an unfair advantage here\" into \"women get an unfair advantage here but they're still the victim\".\"\n\nI mean I'd love to discuss the patriarchy but that's irrelevant here.

The privilege of being disproportionately over-represented in the government.  I understand the point you're making now, and thank you for the clarification.\n\nIn the case of A's and B's, if A's are in control of society, then ANY \"discrimination\" against A's is occurring with the willful consent and control of the A's in power, therefore A's are still running the show and are still privileged.  Any advantages that B's have is granted to them by A's - the B's are therefore ingratiated to the A's for \"giving\" them some selective advantages.  Under this conception of privilege, A's are still privileged.\n\nAs a real-world example, if I went to a college in which the entire administration and faculty was white, and they implemented a policy in which black students would have very strict priority in terms of who got accepted in to the school and got top priority for financial aid, as a white student I'd still have the privilege of being white in an institution controlled by whites, because my demographic group would still be the one calling the shots.  \n\nPerhaps though, if you want to flesh out the semantics here, or don't like that type of a definition of privilege (though I think it's valid) I'll offer an expansion on my definition of privilege - in order to have privilege, your demographic group needs to be in control of the system, and you need to be conferred disproportionate advantages by that system.  I think this is true of men in society - that we have a great deal of privilege.  In the cherrypicked examples you used for your hypothetical \"A\" group, then perhaps your hypothetical world wouldn't meet this specific definition of privilege, though I think it would still be worth noting that, although A's are disadvantaged on average, they're still the ones in control.\n\nPrivilege comes in many forms.  One form of privilege is having a better chance of controlling a society.  You can have some forms of privilege without having others.  \n\nMen have the privilege of being more likely to end up in pretty much every major profession (hardly the 0.001% stat you cited).  However, not all men have class-based privilege, because not all men have money. Likewise, some women have the privilege of being white in a society disproportionately run by white people, even though as women they face institutional disadvantages in many other ways.  And because they aren't in control of society they don't have intrinsic \"female privilege.\"  Similarly, you can have the privilege of being a man without having the privilege of personally being in power.\n\nBeing better-treated in a few very specific circumstances (for instance being more likely to have a less severe court sentence) is very different from being institutionally under-represented in all arms of federal government, most industries, most professions, STEM, and the media.  \n\n*edited for paragraph order and a few clarifications"}, {"id": "cmwe8io", "body": "My understanding of the concept of \"privilege\" is that it comes from belonging to a demographic group that's in control of a system. \n\nOppression comes from people in control oppressing people who aren't in control.\n\nIn the US, the government, the media, academia, and business are all male-dominated.

They both arise from the same system and have the same source - our society and culture.  I do think that the oppression women face is greater in that it has a much more substantial impact on daily life, as you implied.  Being less likely to be hired, or promoted, or made CEO, or paid as well as a man...being more likely to be interrupted, or patted on the head, or called \"honey,\" or to be sexually assaulted...these things impact the daily life of women.  The oppressions against men, such as being likely to serve more jailtime, or issues with child custody, or that sort of thing - these impact specific subsets of men under specific circumstances.  It's not systemic or pervasive in the sense that your \"average man\" will probably not have to contend with that sort of issue, whereas your average woman will almost certainly face challenges arising specifically because she is a woman in a patriarchal system.\n\nThat's not to say men can never undergo any form of day-to-day suffering because of gender stereotypes.  Ultimately a system such as ours with strict binary gender roles is, I think, harmful for everyone, although I think men have it easier (I'm a man and I certainly wouldn't want to grow up as a woman in our society!).  \n\nTo me in cases like these it's about how an argument is made - if using an example of male gender-based suffering to demonstrate that gender roles hurt everyone (for instance stigmatization of male sexual assault victims) that's great.  If using the same argument to pretend our society has somehow turned in to some sort of anti-male feminist-run matriarchy, as is likely I think for some (many?) who would be likely to use the term \"female privilege,\" then that's I think a misinterpretation.\n\n\n*Oops, just saw your added paragraphs.\n\n&gt; I also believe that female culture of the past has influenced, in some cases brought about, the privileges that they now have.

To me \"female culture\" means \"cultural movements created independently by women\" and the best examples I can think of that fit that definition are (1) women's suffrage, one of the first times in US history when groups of women got together on their own to write speeches and advocate social change and (2) feminism.

Now, I know what you're thinking- they downvoted you for besmirching feminism!  No.  The incredulity was that I said female privilege was a thing and when I answered the \"totally respectful feminist\" who \"politely\" asked for examples I pointed to the legal system and how women serve 40% the sentence men serve for the same crimes and make up something like 3% or 4% of the prison population.\n\n* First Counterargument:  This is actually oppression because women are seen as fragile children who can't do time or couldn't hurt someone so badly.  \n\nNo.  This isn't oppression.  Yes, it's sexism.  But it's women benefiting from sexism, which is what I understand as the definition of privilege (An unfair advantage rooted in some bigotry or other, eg White Privilege) \n\n* Second Counterargument:  Men commit more crime, so they're a larger portion of the prison population.\n\nWell this is pretty obviously bigotry, so I'm just going to say \"It's the same racist argument racists make, but they swap out \"men\" for \"the blacks\"\" and move right along.\n\n* It's not privilege, it's \"benevolent sexism\".\n\nNo.  This is a double standard that does a backflip over facts and turns \"women get an unfair advantage here\" into \"women get an unfair advantage here **but** they're still the victim\".\n\nThis is on the order of calling sexism against men \"reverse sexism\".

Lack of healthcare, disposability, lack of parental rights, the lot. All of it stems from the thinking that men belong in the field, should be strong, and that women belong at home, rearing children.\n\nPatriarchy sucks for men. It really does. Nobody claims otherwise. But the reason it isn't \"egalitarianism\" or whatever other neologism you want to apply, is that one of the things patriarchy *doesn't* do is deprive men of access to power. That's the key. Women are, *because of their gender*, deprived of access to power and influence, men are not. Most men are deprived of that access for other reasons, such as race or class, but never their gender. Nobody ever said \"do you really think a man is capable of leading this organisation?\", but when people say \"do you really think a man is capable of giving care to this child?\", it's literally the exact same ideology that's behind it, and that's the ideology which is the antithesis to feminism. Thus, it's logical to conclude that while feminism may not solve all of men's problems as a first priority, men's issues are solved as a result of feminism too. When people get angry if you suggest that feminism *should* solve men's problems, it's because there are literally no other isms concerned with *women's* problems, while women are deprived of access to power, so trying to change feminism away from focusing on women isn't helpful at all."}, {"id": "cmwfzmc", "body": "&gt;But the reason it isn't \"egalitarianism\" or whatever other neologism you want to apply, is that one of the things patriarchy doesn't do is deprive men of access to power.

When I first heard it, I went nuts for a couple of days. There was privilege all around me and everyone seemed to have some form of privilege over other people: perfect-eye-sight privilege, right-handedness privilege, being-born-rich privilege, having-good-parents privilege, adult privilege... \n\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that pretty much everyone has some form of privilege in particular situations, but that using privilege in this way isn't very useful. Someone having perfect eye-sight has some (sometimes unfair) advantage over someone who has moderate myopia, but there isn't a societal pressure to behave one way or the other, nor are there active or latent social pressures favoring people with perfect eye-sight (there are small benefits both to wearing glasses and not wearing them).\n\nSo you're technically correct that \"female privilege\" exists, in that (cis-)women have some minor (or medium) advantages in some situations. I wouldn't, however, use the word privilege in this situation for the same reason that I wouldn't call children privileged for not having to pay rent or using the word for describing disabled people because they don't \"have\" to work. The advantage comes from harmful systems or untrue stereotypes. It's still an advantage *in some situations*, but the processes that lead to those advantages generally lead to disadvantages.\n\n&gt; No. This isn't oppression. Yes, it's sexism.\n\nAs I pointed out above, the things that cause people calling women \"weak\" or \"incapable of violence\" shuts down more opportunities than it creates. This particular case isn't completely beneficial either, since judges \"white-knighting\" women can often make sure that those women don't get the help they need. There are other reasons women aren't sentenced as harshly: needing to take care of their children, being seen as mentally unstable... None of which actually come from a position of power women enjoy and they can (once again) result in not getting the help they need or actually being locked up longer, only not in prison but in a psychiatric ward (which are generally harder to get out off than prisons).\n\n&gt; Well this is pretty obviously bigotry, so I'm just going to say \"It's the same racist argument racists make, but they swap out \"men\" for \"the blacks\"\" and move right along.\n\nYou're not racist for saying that some people commit more crimes than others and neither is it sexist. Some groups of people really do commit more crime. What *is* wrong, I think at least, is seeing this higher crime rate as an inherent quality of those groups. In the case of \"the blacks\" it's often that, due to a variety of social structures (such as racism) they get less opportunities in finding a \"real\" job and in the case of men it has (to some extent) to do with the ways men and boys are socialized. Men do commit overwhelmingly more crime. Even if you allow for some bias in arrest rates for men and women, or police glossing over crimes committed by women, you still end up with men committing more crimes. Criminologists offer a variety of explanations for this, but as far as I know none of those are conclusive. (Criminology, as a field, has a hard time actually proving their theories.)\n\n&gt; No. This is a double standard that does a backflip over facts and turns \"women get an unfair advantage here\" into \"women get an unfair advantage here but they're still the victim\".\n\n\"Benevolent sexism\" is in no way an advantage. It's a way of shutting down agency. The phrase itself is also misused a lot of the time.

I basically agree with everything you just said. However, in practice, feminists tend to not stick up for men, even when they are unfairly oppressed. They are egalitarian, but in practice they spend most of their time sticking up for women and women's rights, and don't worry about the men side of the equation. Also, when men stick up for their own rights (proclaiming egalitarianism, just like feminists), they often get put down or attacked as hate mongers, etc. \n\nIn all, I think a lot of men's rights people and feminists are on the same team, but there are baddies in both groups. A lot of them agree about egalitarianism, but stick up for their own sex primarily as a pet project or because they feel victimized. They should get along and stick up for each other and stick up for egalitarianism in general.

People with drivers licenses have the privilege of driving a car; people without licenses don't have that privilege.\n\nBut when you're talking about male privilege, you're talking about the word in its technical usage in Critical Theory. \n\n[Toni D'Orsay has a great post expanding on the idea of privilege here,](http://tonidorsay.tumblr.com/post/96329749059/what-is-privilege) but the short explanation is that privilege in the context of social justice is defined at the level of entire classes, on a widely encompassing scale, and specifically in relation to the unprivileged. \n\nIt doesn't make any sense for male privilege and female privilege to both exist, because the phrase \"male privilege\" describes a state that corresponds to the concept of female stigma. \n\nSocial injustice is an extremely complicated set of problems, which require a sophisticated use of language. Asking who has privilege isn't a topic of debate in critical theory, because it's defined by its relationship to oppression. Trying to define it on the basis of singular people's lives or specific, isolated social conventions outside their civilization-scale context is a misuse of the terminology, and if you're trying to use it that way, you will fail to understand dialogues about social injustice in which it is used."}, {"id": "2pfo8x", "body": "Disclaimer:  I'm one of those nuts who think men and women *both* have privileges and oppressions.\n\nYes, I know.

The main argument I can think of against your point is how relevant those privileges are in comparison to the oppression they receive. The prison argument may be true (I have no knowledge or statistics to refute you), but that's not something that plays into most people's everyday lives. I understand you're using it as an easy to cite example and I assume that there are other examples of \"female privilege\" that are more relevant to everyday life, but for any of those you just have to compare them to the oppression women experience everyday. Does getting to drink for free make up for not being able to walk alone at night? Does having the impetus for sexual selection make up for earning less in a job on average? At a certain point it comes down to a matter of opinion, especially since all these comparisons are so obtuse and arbitrary, but, for me at least, none of those privileges really seem to matter when there's so much extra bullshit you have to live with everyday. It's hard to realize what women have to deal with everyday that men don't have to when you're not a woman. I'm a boy in college, so I don't really have that good of an idea, but, for example, I don't really have to worry about hanging out with strangers. I can walk in a strangers room (not uninvited) or start a conversation with a stranger in public and not be afraid. Not so for women. Women can't really just go hang out with men they don't know by themselves. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that it doesn't really matter if there are privileges. Privileges are ok as long as you're aware of them and they don't come at someone else's expense. It does matter if there is oppression, especially systemic or cultural oppression. It's something we as a society should strive to move past. What we should to achieve that goal is a dickstorm of shitfucks so I really won't get into it. I guess if there's one take home lesson, just try to think of what'd be like to be a woman. Try to put yourself in your female friends' shoes. (Not literally) (unless you're both into that then that's fine)\n\nAlso, any self-respecting feminist will tell you feminism means equality. I guess it's easy to get turned off by the crazies, but feminism just means supporting *equality* for women and maybe trying to be a little empathetic for the issues women have to deal with that men don't.

For example, [Black men are extraordinarily over-represented in the prison population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_of_incarcerated_African-American_males). So when talking about \"men are more likely to be in prison\", it's probably more accurate to say \"non-White men are more likely to be in prison\".\n\nSimilarly, as [FreedomCow mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2pfo8x/cmv_female_privilege_exists/cmwfaz6), many of the instances of \"female privilege\" are really only cases of \"White female privilege\" or \"high-SES female privilege\". It distorts the discussion to discuss these issues only in terms of gender if there are other driving factors at play.\n\nNow, with regard to benevolent sexism, the issue is partially that feminists are trying to call attention to the deeper, root cause of some of these issues you mention. In other words, if women being less likely to be incarcerated for the same crime is merely a symptom of a deeper cause (gender norms and stereotypes), then it makes sense to not get caught up on treating the symptom and work on treating the deeper illness. Of course, if we work together to tear down entrenched gender norms, this should have the effect of reducing the inequity between men's and women's incarceration rates. So it's not like feminists are disagreeing with you that it's a problem. They are just trying to engage with deeper structural issues that they care about. Benevolent sexism may benefit women in terms of prison sentences, but it has also led to millions of women throughout history being essentially relegated to home life, unable to work or support themselves. Their point is that they're two sides of the same coin.\n\nLet me give you a different example to see if it helps. There are a number of positive stereotypes about African Americans: the idea that they're good at sports (especially basketball), that they're good at dancing and very musical, etc. They may get favourable treatment when it comes to being drafted to basketball teams, and you could rightly think of this as an \"advantage\" that they receive. But this also comes at the cost of fitting them into a narrow box, where people presume that \"if you're Black, you must be really good at sports\" (which, of course for those non-musical, non-athletic Black people, I'm sure is a pain in the ass), and it also comes at the cost of steering Black people away from math and science, for example. It has implications for their perceived intelligence, and serves to perpetuate both the positive *and* the negative stereotypes.\n\nMy point here is that pointing to a positive benefit or stereotype of a group that overall faces many negative stereotypes can seem disingenuous, no matter what your true intentions are. If you are really interested in equality, that's excellent! But we need to make sure to look past the surface-level problems to also consider the deeper, structural barriers and cultural norms that feed up into the surface-level statistics. The cultural norms that exist create both the positive and the negative stereotypes (for instance, research has shown that benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are positively correlated). It's not that nobody at any time benefits from these. For a woman who loves being a housewife, she is served well by it. But the norms serve to limit people and push them into little boxes, and does so disproportionately for groups like women, people of colour, people with disabilities, LGBT people, etc."}, {"id": "cmwomdh", "body": "The issue when it comes to many discussions of \"female privilege\" or \"male disadvantage\" (whichever way you want to look at it) is that oftentimes the statistics being discussed have more to do with race or SES than with gender, per se. For example, [Black men are extraordinarily over-represented in the prison population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_of_incarcerated_African-American_males). So when talking about \"men are more likely to be in prison\", it's probably more accurate to say \"non-White men are more likely to be in prison\".\n\nSimilarly, as [FreedomCow mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2pfo8x/cmv_female_privilege_exists/cmwfaz6), many of the instances of \"female privilege\" are really only cases of \"White female privilege\" or \"high-SES female privilege\". It distorts the discussion to discuss these issues only in terms of gender if there are other driving factors at play.\n\nNow, with regard to benevolent sexism, the issue is partially that feminists are trying to call attention to the deeper, root cause of some of these issues you mention. In other words, if women being less likely to be incarcerated for the same crime is merely a symptom of a deeper cause (gender norms and stereotypes), then it makes sense to not get caught up on treating the symptom and work on treating the deeper illness. Of course, if we work together to tear down entrenched gender norms, this should have the effect of reducing the inequity between men's and women's incarceration rates. So it's not like feminists are disagreeing with you that it's a problem. They are just trying to engage with deeper structural issues that they care about. Benevolent sexism may benefit women in terms of prison sentences, but it has also led to millions of women throughout history being essentially relegated to home life, unable to work or support themselves. Their point is that they're two sides of the same coin.\n\nLet me give you a different example to see if it helps.

Nevertheless, these biases can certainly work in tandem (and interact with each other).

I'm here to confirm for you that female privilege does exist, even if it is based off of sexism. We do get certain perks, but almost all of those perks assume that we need protecting. It may be true that men are more likely to be attacked, more likely to serve more time for crimes they commit and more likely to not have people to empathize with and more likely to die on the job. We also have stats saying women are more likely to be raped and abused, but I doubt the overall accuracy of those just because men are probably a lot less likely to report or even see themselves as victims in the same way that women do.\n\n I am feminist not because the world only has oppression for women, but mainly because despite what men go through women are the ones who are taught to fear, to look over their shoulders, to let themselves be traumatized. we are taught the big bad world is out to get us and the damage this does to our collective psyche is alarming. in the society we are all referencing it is bad, but there are other cultures where it is much worse. we are seen as less competent, are paid less, hired less, judged more for speaking out. society doesn't expect us to be strong, it expects us to victimize ourselves alongside with it. \n\nThe arguments you're coming across about the words \"privilege\" and \"oppression\" are all semantics and based on sociopolitical theory. according to those definitions women have no privileges and you can't be racist against white people. I'm not so sure it's that black and white, but it's important to remember in all of this that perception is key. women are perceived as less intelligent, less capable, and more easily taken advantage of. even when men are perceived as aggressive, and able to handle themselves they are granted positions of power in people's minds. the ramifications of these stereotypes are real for both parties, but I believe  the oppression  you're discussing has a lot more to do with cultural perception.\n\n this does not negate what men go through, but the truth is that feminism, in attempting to create change for this perceived status, doesn't have room to take men into account. this isn't cold, or cruel, but it's about expending available resources and momentum. Sometimes feminism positively affects privileges for men, such as encouraging parental based leave as opposed to just maternity leave so that parenting is more balanced, or increasing access to abortion so that men and women  don't have the unwanted financial burden of an unplanned for child, but women are the focus of the movement.\n\n to reference your racism comparison, it would be like white people asking for attention from #blacklivesmatter. It's true that white people are more likely to be on welfare and commit suicide, but when the issue at hand is black people's lives it's not always efficient to expand the conversation and lose momentum. This also has to do with representation in power. White people and men are very much over represented in government. if they're not looking after their own than people ought to speak out, but the only ones you get are white power people who blame other races, and MRAs that blame feminists. This helps no one. \n\nAs for your argument about feminism existing to extend female privilege, it depends on who you ask. My take is that the problem with privilege is only that some people have it and others don't. So yes, please give me all your privileges and I'll give you some of mine.\n\n Does all this mean I'm not an egalitarian? I don't see why the two are mutually exclusive. I see myself as an egalitarian as well as a feminist. My issue is that I've met a ton of armchair egalitarians that want equality for all but won't dismantle the issues addressing individual groups to get shit done. feminists are able to do that, even if it doesn't reach everybody. \n\nAs for the super righteous rage you were expecting, I hope I've disappointed you, even though I must admit some of your posts come across as not really respectful of feminists in general. That being said, there are a good number of feminists at SRD or SRS or whatever, and Tumblr, that I think are actually terrible for the movement and embrace the victimhood mentality so thoroughly that they get personally flustered if their political positions are critiqued. I don't condone this, and hope you don't have to wade through too much of that bullshit.\n"}, {"id": "2pfo8x", "body": "Disclaimer:  I'm one of those nuts who think men and women *both* have privileges and oppressions.\n\nYes, I know.

Sometimes, though not always, people within the movement do police it).\n\nPeople will say that it's 'stupid for people to be offended by attitude, but not the content', but I think it's stupid for people to use that as an excuse to not try to engage with people. It's annoying trying to change the way you present things, and ideally you wouldn't *have* to change the way you present things, but ultimately people have to put their big girl pants on and try to get their message across in the most palatable way for whatever group they're trying to get the message to.\n\nI, personally, might describe this stuff as *benevolent sexism* because I'm a woman and that's how I notice that it effects me. I'm probably *less* likely to notice particular anti-male sentiments because I know I don't generally treat men and women differently, much like how a lot of men are probably less likely to notice particular anti-female sentiments. I get annoyed when people immediately assume I can't defend myself in arguments, even though they're 'helping' me. However, if someone's being really horrible to me, I admit that it's possible that people are more likely to jump to my aid than if I was a man (everything else being equal about me obviously). It's the same with other things - people are probably more likely to let me comfort them as a woman than if I was a man, and that gets irritating for me sometimes because there can be an expectation for me to comfort people, but it's probably rarer for me to be refused as a 'shoulder to cry on' as it were.\n\nI think it tends to be called benevolent sexism because it's to do with being seen as a highly prized object/pet/etc. rather than a human being, and that can come with privileges but no one in their right mind would want to be considered an object. I'd argue that it goes so far the other direction with men that sometimes they aren't cared for enough when they need to be - we don't look at other things that caused the problems, it's purely their fault. (Actually this kind of reminds me of general positions of responsibility in some respects - would you rather be an employer or an employee? Employers get to make rules and get paid a lot of money, but *in theory* take the blame when things go *very* wrong and have to answer to a lot of people. Employees don't get much technical power and get paid a fraction of the money, but are able to avoid blame when it gets *really* awful. I prefer being responsible because I actually *like* taking responsibility for things when they're actually my fault, but I don't want to be blamed for something an employee did - which could potentially happen. Maybe that kind of thing happens more to men? I dunno.)\n\nI think your prison argument might be a poor one to talk about - there's a lot of fighting going on about men also being possibly *more likely* to commit crimes - maybe something to do everyday life stuff might be more helpful to tackle them with? I do agree with you though, women are afforded privileges in a sense - it's just worth bearing in mind that you might be talking to a woman who thinks the freedom to make your own decisions/be judged by your perceived decisions is worth it, even if it means throwing people who are *actually less* able to make their own decisions under the bus. (also, I think there is a lack of focus on men's issues - from incarceration rate to the bullying of 'feminine' boys. However, I think that we should also address that this is at least partially due to socialisation that encourages men to be aggressive, or more impulsive, or less 'feminine' - which has the advantages of men being more likely to ask for promotions, but also the disadvantages of men being more likely to commit crimes. Vice versa too - women are less likely to commit crimes, which is good, but more likely to not ask for promotions, which is bad.)"}, {"id": "2pfo8x", "body": "Disclaimer:  I'm one of those nuts who think men and women *both* have privileges and oppressions.\n\nYes, I know.

It's probably unbalanced, but anyone who has tried to balance even a slightly complex game knows that it isn't a trivial problem. It's not a matter of removing one or two overpowered elements. The elements work together in concert for a skillful player, and three relatively weak-seeming tools become ultimately powerful when used in concert.\n\nIt's possible, for example, that one gender might be physically stronger and another physically weaker. That seems to confer privilege. If, however, the society is designed such that use of that physical strength for personal benefit is a social taboo, and additionally that using physical strength for economic reward becomes a low class trait, and appreciating physical development is seen as objectification, then the tables turn. The trait that conferred privilege is now actually a handicap. Now you must appear to succeed in spite of your physical might, rather than because of it.

I, personally, require that women compete with me on a level playing field. They either succeed or fail in my eyes based on their aggregate performance and not due to some individual attribute.

I *like* buying stuff for her and supporting her financially because now someone I like has a source of stress taken away from her and is free to explore her own interests without worrying about other things.
