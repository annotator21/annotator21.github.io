I think this takes priority over a person's right to profit from someone else's sex, and I think the two are mutually exclusive in some ways. \n\nIf prostitution were to be legalized, that would necessitate regulation, meaning health checks and other standards that potential prostitutes have to meet. Additionally, the field may end up being highly competitive, much like the porn industry- a potential prostitute may end up having to step *way* out of their comfort zone in order to have any hope of success. So what happens if someone doesn't meet those standards? They'll do what prostitutes are already doing and work outside the law. Doing so will potentially get them, and possibly their clients into legal trouble. Thus, the government is still legislating how people can have sex for money, and market forces may even make legal employment not an attractive option. \n\nBasically, legalization of prostitution is bad for a lot of prostitutes in the same way legal marijuana is bad for a lot of growers- they can't adapt their illegal business into a legal one. That may seem fair in the case of marijuana growers, but I think the key difference is that production and selling of a substance isn't as fundamental of a right as doing as one wants with their body.\n\nAnyway, I think a lot of the benefits of legalization would also come about with decriminalization. Victims of human trafficking would still be able to come forward without fear of being punished, and we'd still have lots of dollars being legally spent and brought in from outside, stimulating the economy. But now, instead of corporations and government dictating how we can have sex, the individual prostitutes are controlling the industry, as they should.

I've been a victim of crime, I've given evidence for the prosecution in a case where I was not the victim, and I've been on the jury of a couple of criminal cases\u2014but I am not a lawyer. \n\nThis thought was prompted by [the recent Shia LaBeouf incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf#Performance_art), or rather by the response of many commentators to it. Quite a few folks took the opportunity to boldly announce that they \u201cbelieve\u201d LaBeouf, or to make comments along the lines of \u201cyou don't have to be a nice person to be a victim\u201d and I think I understand the motivation of these commentators and they seem well intentioned. But the principle seems deeply misguided.\n\nWhat do I think should happen to someone who claims to have been the victim of a crime, and perhaps especially a crime agains the person? They should be listened to sympathetically. Their allegation should be investigated promptly, throughly and fairly. In too many cases these things do not happen. If the investigators find evidence that an offence has been committed then they should vigorously seek out the offenders. Suspected offenders should be brought to trial, promptly and fairly. In too many cases, these things also do not happen.\n\nBut: to *believe* the claim made by anyone who says that they have been the victim of a crime is a mistake. It's not the job of investigators to believe alleged victims, its their job to find evidence for what did happen. Neglecting the very tiny number of cases that manage to come to trial when the alleged victim has actually been lying, we can say that by the time a trial happens the alleged victim really is a victim. But it's still not the job of the jury to *believe* what they say, it's the job of the jury to fairly assess the evidence of guilt against the defendant. Direct and cross\u2013examination of the victim is only one source of evidence.\n\nWhat would happen if we did just *believe* the claims made by alleged victims? I can only see this lead to summary retribution, not justice. John Doe goes to the police and says \u201cJane Roe stole my wallet\u201d, and if we (the police, the courts, society at large) *believe* John Doe, why then Jane Roe should go immediately to jail, no? Why bother with an investigation, since John Doe told us what happened and we believe him. Why bother with a trial?\n\nSo, we should not, indeed must not *believe* alleged victims. We should sympathetically, promptly and fairly investigate their claims, and promptly, justly, try suspects. But *belief* shouldn't enter into the discussion.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

A goal is never set in a vacuum.  A president makes decisions, yes, but the context of the position drastically reduces the number of rational decisions.  A president acts in his or her own interest by being a good president.  Luckily, governments have evolved this way for the most part.  The people in command are rewarded based on how effective their lead is.  A king whose kingdom makes no money will not be rich, so they tend to make decisions that are in the interest of the kingdom.  \n\nIt would be extremely irrational for a president to spend a bunch of money on hookers and blow one weekend.  It would make their lives much, much harder.  This is not necessarily true for someone in the financial industry.  It would be irrational for a president to spend 5 hours a day reading about artificial intelligence.  This is not true for a janitor, or a professor, or a waiter, busser, mathematician etc. etc.  They have more freedom to do what they want with their spare time.\n\nIn this way, it's not that the president is deciding things, and that causes a chain reaction that everyone follows.  What he decides is constrained by his position and those under his power to a large extent.\n\nThis is more obvious in the case of a CEO.  Their rational decision space is limited by the shareholders as well as their subordinates as well as legal regulations (depending on the extent of the legal consequences). \n\nThe point is, people in different positions have their options limited in different ways.  And in general a system evolves to place people in positions where their rational self-interest aligns with that of the institution as a whole.  People are constantly sacrificing to institutions because if their decision space was not limited by those constraints, they would probably just look around for food until they're not hungry, then go hang out at the beach.  This is an unstable equilibrium because Romans and Vikings.\n\nHumans set pieces of goals, but they can add up to something more than the sum of their parts.  Like in an ant colony when individual ants each make decisions, but they're not seeing the bigger picture.  They might decide to turn left and search an area if they pick up a certain pheromone, but they aren't deciding it because they know what's going on or because they think it needs to be done.  It's genetically defined in that instance.\n\nIn humans, we're a bit more flexible, and we tend to see more of the bigger picture.  But there's a limit at which you just put your head down and concentrate on what the best decision is for you in the moment, and by pushing people into deep enough specialization, you create the silo effect where information is not shared effectively, and you create essentially different informational environments that cause different groups to act independently of the bigger picture.  Then the way that those groups interact with each other determines the overall group behavior.  \n\nA white person working in an academic institution has a lot invested in the truth of science.  They work in an environment where people respect the scientific method and find it difficult to understand why anyone wouldn't.  Of course, long before the scientific method was established, there were entire cities built, with fountains, and people lived happy lives. \n\nThis is a mostly different informational environment from Ferguson, which has its own culture and vocabulary that is starkly different from both of those.  Even more informationally isolated from all of those is a farmer in southern China.  But, they might not live that far from Hong Kong, where there are people who share more in common with the financial sector of the US than they do the farmer in China.  There are things that someone in the financial industry does not have to pay attention to that a farmer does.\n\nBy taking advantage of the asymmetry in these behavioral, informational, and attentional spaces, an institution can lock people into probable behavioral patterns.\n\nWhen you say goals are set by individuals, each goal is made of an infinite number of sub-goals.  As a task such as \"build a house\" gets done, it is basically digested by multiple people into a bunch of steps.  But where does the goal \"build a house\" come from?  A development company?  A government?  An individual with a lot of money?  If it comes from the development company who decided it?  The CEO?  What made them think it was a good idea to use a bunch of cash?  Was it because Fannie Mae decided to offer mortgages with lower interest rates?  Did they do that *specifically* to get more houses built?  If they did, then I'd say they were part of the decision-making process, but was the house being built the result of their goal, or the development corporation's?  Or the legislators who came up with Fannie Mae?  Or the people who voted them in?  Or their parents for instilling liberal values?  Who decided where to build the house?  Was it the architect?  No, they just decided where on the plot it would go.  What is the person in charge of buying the land?  No, they were limited by what land was available.

Pretty much any group of people that shares a set of rules.\n\n&gt;How are institutions better served by taking actions that maintain or promote economic inequality? Which institutions are doing this?\n\nIn the short-term, economic inequality allows institutions to get more work out of people.  People who need things more desperately tend to do work for cheaper and work longer hours.  The fact is, there aren't many people who would work a call center if they had a feasible alternative.  A call center company needs some way of getting people to come in and do that rather than spending the day at the beach.  \n\nThey can do this because there is a system of institutions in place that prevent most people from getting food unless they work for money and buy it.  In some societies, the rewards for doing this are higher than they would be for a hunter-gatherer doing a similar amount of work.  In others (i.e. North Korea), they are not, and there are other factors that compel people to work--the threat of violence, shame, punishment of family, etc.  \n\nOf course, this pressure toward more inequality isn't healthy in the long-term, which is why corporations aren't the only institutions that have evolved.  Governments and labor unions have evolved, too in some attempt to balance things out.\n\nHowever, a government receives more revenue when it governs more people.  So governments evolved to be expansionist.  To expand, it needs to get people to do more than just enough to sustain everyone.  \n\nThe thing is, thermodynamic work is being expended on behalf of the government.  All thermodynamic work is the result of potential energy being turned into kinetic.  Granted there are crap-tons of complex, interconnected intermediate processes, but it ultimately has to come from something.\n\n\n&gt;Could you give an example (of institutions pitting people against each other)?\n\nMaybe \"pitting people against each other\" is the wrong way to say it.  Maybe I should say \"pitting people against themselves.\"  I have a friend who really didn't want a building to be built next to a park.  Few people did.  The company that wanted the building built was looking for people to go door to door flyering and spreading info to promote getting it built.  She was poor.  They were going to pay $30 /hr.  \n\nIf she didn't do it, they would easily find someone else who could.  The likelihood of her having an effect by not taking the job was very small.  At $30 /hr, she could afford to save up to finish her degree, which would help her gain more influence to promote her view in the future.  By most accounts, it was in her interest to take the job, and the only real downside would be acting aganist her interest in this low-priority task.  \n\nIn this way, she only has one rational course of action.  Now imagine that everyone in society has choices like these all the time, and they weave into each other such that they're codependent.  \n\nThe person who owns the company might not even want a building there, but they need to meed the needs of their shareholders, and if they don't build it, someone else will because it's prime real-estate, and if they make a big profit on this project, maybe they can invest in a big leet-certified building for their next one.  And their shareholders disagree, too, but they don't want to divest, because they don't feel responsible, and the financials are solid.  If they don't plan for their retirement, they're going to be leeching off the social security, which is bad, too, right?  \n\nIn this way everyone can take part in something that nobody agrees with, not because they're selfish or short-sighted, but because the network of institutions sets up an environment where each of them has one decision that provides maximum utility.

Let's see if I can explain better:\n\n*Step 1: The Seduction*\n\nThere is you and &lt;good cause&gt;. You really want the power and ability to make &lt;good cause&gt; happen. There are a couple of ways to go about it, but the easy one is to tap into your emotions. Anger and fear are designed to motivate and empower. Our endocrine system is designed to get peak out of us when we let those things flow, but at a price. Yeah, there's a finite amount of total power out there and &lt;good cause&gt; naturally requires a big piece of it, but &lt;good cause&gt; is totally worth it. Not only is &lt;good cause&gt; worth it, but it's likely that at the end of this you can look back and say that despite the shortcuts the world is better off because you put &lt;good cause&gt; first over everything.\n\nSo, rather than go the slow and painful route that the light side represents you take the easier and quicker route that the dark side presents. As a result you make a lot of quick gains in terms of power in the name of &lt;good cause&gt;, and leave peers who selected the slow way in your dust quickly... suckers. You also have lots of free time to work on &lt;good cause&gt; that you wouldn't otherwise, so sweet.\n\nThen you run across someone who really smacks you in the face. They don't care you are doing it for &lt;good cause&gt;. They just want the relative power to do whatever it is they want to do and don't care who they hurt, what a jerk. Which brings you to...\n\n*Part 2: The Descent*\n\nThis guy is a rival. He has a big old pile of power that rivals yours, and he is all in on beating you to death with it. Instead of it just being you and &lt;good cause&gt;, it's now a three person problem. You can't spend all your time on &lt;good cause&gt; anymore, you need to get this other jackass out of the way first. So, you spend more and more time to kicking that guy's ass so you can get back to the important matters.\n\nCue epic light saber duel. \n\nYou won, sweet. Only... there's another rival. Wait a second, there's not just *ONE* other rival there are *THOUSANDS*. There are people who have things that you absolutely need for &lt;good cause&gt; but cannot be induced to give it up or share for their own petty reasons, so you'll have to take it from them. There are people who want to take what you have already acquired for their own, obviously nefarious, ends who must be stopped. There are former peers who no longer trust you and are willing to step in to maintain balance, or probably just to prove that they are still your equal in their own minds. All these people have to be dealt with and dealt with soon before they prevent you from accomplishing &lt;good cause&gt;. \n\nYou start fighting rivals. And you've been winning. Your stronger than them. You've been pilling up more power than they can. When they pool their power together to come at you at once you've been able to split them up and destroy them. Face it you're awesome, but...\n\n*Part 3: The Nadir*\n\n... the number of rivals doesn't seem to be dropping. Yeah you kill that ass who jumped you in the alley, but he has a kid/business associate/friend/lover/neighbor who immediately swears vengeance and starts building power to face you. If you just let them go then what happens? You have to waste all kinds of time and energy fighting them on their terms when they are at their strongest. You could be using that time to do other things, like mopping up other rivals so you can finally get around to do.... whatever it was all this is about.\n\nYou come to the conclusion that that it's better to kill that threat now rather than face that threat as a rival later. It's not an unreasonable conclusion at the time in context. It's just, well every single one of those younglings will grow up to be a Jedi and come after you. They aren't helpless children. They are cadets in a military academy, and therefore valid war targets. What should you do, pat them on the head and say \"good luck killing me in ten years?\" What if you're still fighting existing rivals in ten years and haven't made much progress with... well... anything except competing with rivals for power. Seems to make sense to just end it here and now, doesn't it?\n\n*Part 4: Realization*\n\nAll of a sudden something unique happens. &lt;Good cause&gt; smacks you in the face. At this point you have come to notice that you've done terrible, horrible things ostensibly in the name of &lt;good cause&gt; only you're no closer to achieving &lt;good cause&gt; then you were at the beginning. At some point the fighting and the power grabs took up so much of your time and effort that you totally lost sight of what all of this was about in the first place.\n\nFrom here you have some pretty hard choices to make. The easy one is to just give up on &lt;good cause&gt;. You have a lot of power and are really into these struggles, maybe you can achieve something else instead. Like, say, bringing order to the galaxy or something. The harder path is to double down on &lt;good cause&gt;, you know go back to your former peers (if they are still capable of trusting you) and start working on &lt;good cause&gt; the right way. You can't even keep much of your ill-gotten power, mostly because you have to actually repent or you'll simply fall right back into the child-murder in time. Repenting means regretting the whole thing, not just the part that got you caught. It takes true greatness to let go of the power that you spent so much time working (and doing genuinely terrible things) to attain, and chuck the justifications you used to protect yourself from facing the true horror of what you did.\n\n____\n\nThe force doesn't control you like a puppet. It lures you down a specific path using the power to achieve your goals. The problems is that in order to get and maintain the power you must give up a great deal in the end, but that doesn't hit you until you've already gathered so much power and done so many terrible things that coming back is impossible.\n\nThe force doesn't give you things for free. It makes you pay for every bit you get out of it. The Light side just asks you to make the necessary sacrifices up front. The Dark waits until after you're in the middle of something and then presents a bill. In theory you could use the dark side and still manage to achieve your goals... it's just that you have become a magnet for situations that don't have a \"good\" solution but a choice between an evil solution and a difficult one that get more extreme as you get more powerful. If the point of choosing the Dark Side in the first place was that it was easier then people who chose the Dark Side will also chose the easy/evil way out.\n\nAt the end of the prequels Anakin was face with that choice and couldn't make the hard choice to face the possibility that he would lose his love and family.

I think this is problematic for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, it is linguistically incorrect.\n\nPrivilege implies an intentionally granted advantage - such as the privilege to live in a certain area, or use certain facilities, and so on. There are privileges like this that certain groups have - for example, straights have the privilege of marriage.\n\nBut, not all advantages fit into this category. For example, one of the greatest advantages a white person has over a black person is that the white person is far less likely to be murdered by a law enforcement official. This is not a privilege, since it is not something intentionally granted, but it is still used under that umbrella term.\n\nSecond, it is an abrasive term.\n\nPeople hear a phrasing like \"white privilege\", and bristle at it, because they do not necessarily feel that they have had privileged lives. On an individual level, the advantages of belonging to any one group tends to get washed out by individual variation and the fact that there are so many characteristics, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, that one is able to vary in.\n\nOn the other hand, people tend to recognize easily that they have had some advantages, and do not bristle nearly so strongly against a statement like that. A word like \"advantage\" is then more appropriate to having a discussion on the topic, because it is less likely to cause a person to immediately assume the defensive.\n\nThird, it seems to imply a one-way street.\n\nThe word \"privilege\" seems to imply a unilateral advantage, whereas \"advantage\" can handle more nuance. To put it another way, it is more flowing to say a sentence like \"Men and women have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other\" than to say \"men and women are both privileged over each other\". And, it is certainly the case that, while lopsided, there are advantages that go both ways for many of these sorts of groupings.\n\nFor instance, straight couples have the advantage of, say, being able to have children together without medical assistance (excluding fertility issues), over gay couples, while gay couples have the advantage of not needing to worry about the possibility of an accidental pregnancy.\n\nYes, I have heard inherent (rather than social) characteristics like that included in the overall term \"privilege\", but if you don't think they are appropriate, another example: from an early age, males are taught that \"you don't hit a girl\", while girls are given no such instruction against violence, and indeed, violence committed by women on men is treated as more of a joke, or dismissed (\"you got beaten up by a GIRL?\"). I trust I don't need to provide an example of the opposite - I don't think I've met anyone who rejects the inverse premise, but on request, I will do so.\n\nSo, with all this considered, \"privilege\" is a narrow word used to incorrectly describe a larger set of issues which can more accurately be labelled and understood with the words \"advantage\" and \"disadvantage\", and furthermore is unnecessarily abrasive, such that its use also impedes constructive discourse.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think this is problematic for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, it is linguistically incorrect.\n\nPrivilege implies an intentionally granted advantage - such as the privilege to live in a certain area, or use certain facilities, and so on. There are privileges like this that certain groups have - for example, straights have the privilege of marriage.\n\nBut, not all advantages fit into this category. For example, one of the greatest advantages a white person has over a black person is that the white person is far less likely to be murdered by a law enforcement official. This is not a privilege, since it is not something intentionally granted, but it is still used under that umbrella term.\n\nSecond, it is an abrasive term.\n\nPeople hear a phrasing like \"white privilege\", and bristle at it, because they do not necessarily feel that they have had privileged lives. On an individual level, the advantages of belonging to any one group tends to get washed out by individual variation and the fact that there are so many characteristics, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, that one is able to vary in.\n\nOn the other hand, people tend to recognize easily that they have had some advantages, and do not bristle nearly so strongly against a statement like that. A word like \"advantage\" is then more appropriate to having a discussion on the topic, because it is less likely to cause a person to immediately assume the defensive.\n\nThird, it seems to imply a one-way street.\n\nThe word \"privilege\" seems to imply a unilateral advantage, whereas \"advantage\" can handle more nuance. To put it another way, it is more flowing to say a sentence like \"Men and women have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other\" than to say \"men and women are both privileged over each other\". And, it is certainly the case that, while lopsided, there are advantages that go both ways for many of these sorts of groupings.\n\nFor instance, straight couples have the advantage of, say, being able to have children together without medical assistance (excluding fertility issues), over gay couples, while gay couples have the advantage of not needing to worry about the possibility of an accidental pregnancy.\n\nYes, I have heard inherent (rather than social) characteristics like that included in the overall term \"privilege\", but if you don't think they are appropriate, another example: from an early age, males are taught that \"you don't hit a girl\", while girls are given no such instruction against violence, and indeed, violence committed by women on men is treated as more of a joke, or dismissed (\"you got beaten up by a GIRL?\"). I trust I don't need to provide an example of the opposite - I don't think I've met anyone who rejects the inverse premise, but on request, I will do so.\n\nSo, with all this considered, \"privilege\" is a narrow word used to incorrectly describe a larger set of issues which can more accurately be labelled and understood with the words \"advantage\" and \"disadvantage\", and furthermore is unnecessarily abrasive, such that its use also impedes constructive discourse.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I feel the same way, in a lot of ways. I think, also, that it has the problem of causing people to focus too much on the idea of changing people's minds, rather than just understanding their position.\n\nI've considered posting a CMV about how the CMV reddit is fundamentally flawed when it comes to actually having productive discussions and ending up with an accurate viewpoint after everything is said and done (because it gives the \"opposition\" to the idea too much influence), but I doubt it would actually do anything. At best I expect I'd get messages like \"if you don't like it, leave\".\n\nSo yeah. I understand what you mean."}, {"id": "2oirow", "body": "In social justice contexts, \"Privilege\" is often used to mean \"an advantage that someone has due to being a member of a certain group\". I think this is problematic for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, it is linguistically incorrect.\n\nPrivilege implies an intentionally granted advantage - such as the privilege to live in a certain area, or use certain facilities, and so on. There are privileges like this that certain groups have - for example, straights have the privilege of marriage.\n\nBut, not all advantages fit into this category. For example, one of the greatest advantages a white person has over a black person is that the white person is far less likely to be murdered by a law enforcement official. This is not a privilege, since it is not something intentionally granted, but it is still used under that umbrella term.\n\nSecond, it is an abrasive term.\n\nPeople hear a phrasing like \"white privilege\", and bristle at it, because they do not necessarily feel that they have had privileged lives. On an individual level, the advantages of belonging to any one group tends to get washed out by individual variation and the fact that there are so many characteristics, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, that one is able to vary in.\n\nOn the other hand, people tend to recognize easily that they have had some advantages, and do not bristle nearly so strongly against a statement like that. A word like \"advantage\" is then more appropriate to having a discussion on the topic, because it is less likely to cause a person to immediately assume the defensive.\n\nThird, it seems to imply a one-way street.\n\nThe word \"privilege\" seems to imply a unilateral advantage, whereas \"advantage\" can handle more nuance. To put it another way, it is more flowing to say a sentence like \"Men and women have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other\" than to say \"men and women are both privileged over each other\". And, it is certainly the case that, while lopsided, there are advantages that go both ways for many of these sorts of groupings.\n\nFor instance, straight couples have the advantage of, say, being able to have children together without medical assistance (excluding fertility issues), over gay couples, while gay couples have the advantage of not needing to worry about the possibility of an accidental pregnancy.\n\nYes, I have heard inherent (rather than social) characteristics like that included in the overall term \"privilege\", but if you don't think they are appropriate, another example: from an early age, males are taught that \"you don't hit a girl\", while girls are given no such instruction against violence, and indeed, violence committed by women on men is treated as more of a joke, or dismissed (\"you got beaten up by a GIRL?\"). I trust I don't need to provide an example of the opposite - I don't think I've met anyone who rejects the inverse premise, but on request, I will do so.\n\nSo, with all this considered, \"privilege\" is a narrow word used to incorrectly describe a larger set of issues which can more accurately be labelled and understood with the words \"advantage\" and \"disadvantage\", and furthermore is unnecessarily abrasive, such that its use also impedes constructive discourse.\n\nChange my view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I honestly want it to be changed, because holding this view is existentially painful.**\n\n---\n\nEconomics is what dictates that a person from the United States will feel more empathy for an Italian than a Ugandan, a Japanese than a Somalian. For humans, our economic activity is closely related to how we think about each other and how we choose to interact. We view other cultures and societies first through the process of trade, and those who do not have anything we want in the near future are initially ignored.\n\nThis self-imposed ignorance can be overcome. A person can empathize with any other person if they put in the effort; the frustrating reality is more that we cannot reasonably expend that much effort on simply relating with other people.\n\nIn fact, it may simply be less effort to change the way we interact economically in a manner that allows us to relate to others as people. **Equality is a necessary component of interaction if humans continue to use economics as the basis for social empathy.**\n\nIn that sense, we can suppose that our economics is an important, if not the most important, component of social interaction between large groups of people. Economics shape how we think about and interact with people that we don't identify as part of our inclusive group.\n\nPeople define their inclusive group on different scales for different situations. At home most would consider their family or their cohabitants as constituting their inclusive group. But at work, most people define their inclusive group as their co-workers of approximately the same responsibility and compensation.\n\nEconomically, we consider our inclusive groups to often be everyone that we can identify as having a similar lifestyle or opportunity. One might consider a person from a different part of their country to be part of their economic inclusive group just because they also use the same kinds of cars, food, shelter and clothing.\n\nNo matter what setting, a larger amalgamation of people results in us loosening our internal idea of what our inclusive groups are, but never to include the entire group. We segregate our thought into spaces that do not force us to consider divisions within the group we are dealing with at any given time, and flock to those who we feel can understand our own unique position within the larger group.\n\nThe challenge facing our society then is not to be more honest and fair in our dealings with others, but rather to include others on a species scale as part of the group we identify with. The honesty and fairness follow that process, not precede it.\n\nFew people are willing to wrong those that they feel are part of the same group, no matter how temporary or diverse that group is. It is a psychological threshold, and not a logical one. The mere presence of barriers to communication leads us to view the opinions, positions and values of others as being less important than our own.\n\nIn many ways this is a very functional way of thinking. We must all consider our own values and opinions to be important, and indeed logic would have us believe that we hold the opinions we do because no one has presented a more compelling argument for any other opinion. The focal point is further back than our opinions, it lies within our belief in the worth of other people.\n\nEconomics represents a situation where it is dysfunctional to continue thinking in this manner.\n\nHow is it that economics, which we use in part to empathize on a social level, considers our needs to be irrelevant information? This is a recipe for suffering *ad nauseum*, in that we set our selves up emotionally to seek empathetic truth in our exchange, but find only inhumanity and desolation.\n\nA profit-centered incentive theoretically rewards those whom bring our society advancement and new opportunity. In fact, that is nearly the entire motivation for participating in society as we now operate.\n\nThis leads to a society controlled and paced by those that can understand better than others. It inherently places more value on those who are able to consider an issue from multiple perspectives, whether those are psychological or logistic. This value encourages others to try and better understand so that they may be rewarded by the economy we have.\n\nThis should lead to a perpetual advancement of knowledge, understanding and technology, whereby those that best understand are those that make decisions.\n\nWhile there are many ways such an economy can go wrong, and in some cases already has, what is most interesting about this approach is that we have fundamentally bought in to a system where people serve our economy, instead of our economy serving people. If one is to put in enough effort, our economy promises reward, but only after penance has been apportioned. The people of our society, no matter the scale of society, have become beholden to a system which at its core is for the purpose of advancing the edge as fast as possible, instead of launching society towards anything.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that our economy condemns us to subsist, while providing the illusion of progress to sate our emotional turmoil.\n\nThe emotional impact of such a situation is fierce. Even in the developed world, the inescapable emotional suffering our economy metes out causes us to perpetually seek comfort and meaning in many other places, such as religion.\n\nThat is not to say that faith is merely a by-product of our economically induced emotional pain, although I understand some may see it that way. Rather, it leads us to expect things of our faith that it is not equipped to provide, because our economic system which should be providing them is failing.\n\nWe seek emotional reward in belief, whether that is religious, spiritual, political or scientific. But these things are not for the purpose of serving emotion, and all of them are areas of knowledge which are greatly harmed by emotional motivation and decision making. In fact such behavior is so dangerous that many systems of religious and spiritual belief indicate that people must overcome their internal emotional disruption before they can receive the rewards of these fields.\n\nIs it any wonder that our world has been plagued by religious violence and intolerance, when the first instruction of many beliefs is to seek emotional serenity that our society is not only failing to provide, but actively working against? Our frustration as a society is expressed in the only way we have direct control over: our interactions with other people. \n\nWe seek confirmation in those that understand us, and release in those that do not. Such a system is and will always be a counter-productive use of effort and worth. Faced with the inner turmoil and emotional suffering that our society requires, we often see two solutions: to commiserate with those who agree, and to silence those who do not.\n\nSuch decision making narrows our view of the world, and lessens our understanding, which is the opposite of what our economy is designed to require. The understanding which our economy is designed to reward is curtailed by our emotional selves, which leaves only those that can suppress emotion or have created a healthy outlet as our leaders. That leaves us with either sociopaths, or people that are viewed as being inhumanly \"perfect\" that are tarnished by the merest suggestion that they might be as damaged and fallible as the rest of us.\n\nIs it surprising that we have so many \"bad people\" making decisions? The combination of our economic and emotional models *should* be generating that result. They are poorly symbiotic systems, and each functions more as a parasite upon the other.\n\nWithout a change in one, our society will self-destruct further and further down the path of irrationality. As it is easier to change our economics than our emotional requirements as a society, it follows that what we really need is a close examination and restructuring of our economic exchange so that it builds with our other social systems, instead of working against them.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It betrays trust, breaks a serious commitment, and shows a lack of respect. The ensuing lies are often as bad, if not worse.\n\nHowever, C has no commitment to B. C is not breaking trust or lying to B. **NOTE: None of this applies C is friends with the B. Then C is breaking trust and being an awful friend.**\n\nOnce A has made the choice that they are willing to cheat, the damage is done. Whether or not A actually cheats at this point has no effect (excluding STDs). I do not see any reason why B would be more upset to learn that A had cheated on him/her, than if B had refrained from doing so only because C did not want to. I would not want to date someone who would have cheated on me if they could any more than I would want to date someone who actually did.\n\nThus, once A has made clear his/her intention or desire (**EDIT: if this is a clear and conscious decision, without outside influence**) to cheat on B, C is doing nothing wrong by going through with it. \n\nAs a continuation, I believe the right thing for C to do is to inform B of A's infidelity regardless. I do not necessarily think there is a *responsibility* for C to do so, though. However, this is not central to my belief, or to this post.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm not suggesting we need to treat strangers the same way we treat friends, what I'm suggesting is that in questions of morality (like lying or like your original scenario) the act itself is moral or immoral regardless of the subject of the act.  Your example of lying perfectly illustrates my point -- it's an immoral act independent of who is being lied to.\n\n&gt; What could possibly make you think this is a defined line and not a spectrum, just like friendship?\n\nI don't think it's a line and I don't think you're acknowledging the point I've been trying to make.  My point is that given your position there must necessarily exist a transition from moral to immoral.  It's probably useful examining the cases right around that transition since the difficult hypotheticals in this scenario will occur there.  That's one of the best ways we can examine our own thoughts and beliefs, to get away from the easy edge cases and try to explore the cases that aren't so obvious.  For the scenario in question, it's thinking about the morality when B is a casual acquaintance, a good acquaintance, someone who used to be a good friend but isn't any longer, etc.  It's asking why the morality could potentially change for subjects that perhaps aren't all that different.  This isn't an argument that you are wrong.  This is simply an appeal for you to closely examine your beliefs and the potentially difficult situations they necessarily imply.\n\n&gt; Yes, see above.\n\nI don't know what this refers to.

Businesses don't tend to go \"shhhh no one can tell society that we're growing and becoming successful\" like a cheating SO. \nThe number of customers, reviews, physical appearance, money spent on improvement and marketing, etc give it away. \n\nIn a cheating situation, the SO may suspect something if the cheater is really obvious or doesn't care anymore, but the whole point is for the cheater to keep it a secret at the SO's expense. It comes down to power and responsibility for the effect of one's actions on others.\n\nWith 2 people keeping a secret, it's easy to hide from a 3rd person. Like I said, it's really subjective depending on the moral framework you operate under. I think that individuals should have an inherent right to create the best life possible for themselves as long as it doesn't harm others(or causes the least harm if it's unavoidable).\n\nIn the case of the businesses, the startup may or may not be intentionally harming other businesses(moral or immoral), but at least the nature of acting in public negates that power and responsibility over the harmed businesses because they have the opportunity to try and create the best future for themselves out of the mess. \n\nWith the couple, this is not the case because we're assuming that the SO is not informed of the situation and (assuming the cheater is a good secret keeper) is unable to become informed(powerless). Plus, it is possible for the non-SO to have the desired outcome(cheater+Non-SO relationship, sex, whatever) without infringing on the SO's rights(by telling her or breaking things off). Therefore I think that if the non-SO operates under the same framework that people have the right to not be subjugated or harmed by others then he or she has a moral obligation to tell the SO or force action(such as a breakup) through the immoral cheater, as long as it doesn't pose a direct risk to him or herself.\n\nI'm not trying to be dumb or unrealistic here. I think that people sometimes do things purely for their own benefit at the expense of others. Maybe the non-SO likes the excitement of being the \"other man/woman\" even though it's not fair to the SO and they have the power to change that.

Whether or not A actually cheats at this point has no effect (excluding STDs). I do not see any reason why B would be more upset to learn that A had cheated on him/her, than if B had refrained from doing so only because C did not want to. I would not want to date someone who would have cheated on me if they could any more than I would want to date someone who actually did.\n\nThus, once A has made clear his/her intention or desire (**EDIT: if this is a clear and conscious decision, without outside influence**) to cheat on B, C is doing nothing wrong by going through with it. \n\nAs a continuation, I believe the right thing for C to do is to inform B of A's infidelity regardless.

Some of these interactions are pleasant, some unpleasant.\n\nSuppose you want someone's property. They don't want to give it to you. You then decide to kill them and take their stuff.\n\nThe community, after seeing the negative consequences of these actions, enacts various laws and moralities to stop these bad events from happening. Evolution, over millions of years, develops various things like empathy and disgust that boost the chance of survival because they minimize the chances of bad events happen.\n\nPeople later see these moralities and follow them to the letter. If there's a situation which is slightly outside their morality sensor doesn't ping and it's ok.\n\nhttp://cinetechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMAX-Kodak-Laser-Projection-James-Bond.jpg\n\nIt's a lot easier to kill someone if you're one degree removed- he might say \"I didn't kill Bond. The laser did. The scientist who pressed a switch did. I may have ordered them but I wasn't directly responsible.\"\n\nBut really, it's immoral because someone is being hurt, not because someone said it's immoral to kill people, or immoral to break someone's trust in you. If you know your actions directly lead to the same negative consequences you who pressed a switch are the same as someone who takes a knife and stabs it into someone's heart.\n\nPeople cheating is a thing you can influence. They need someone willing to do it with, they need to be in the right mood, they may need some seduction before they do it. If you're the sort of person who actions make it easier to happen then your actions are likely to increase the occurrence of cheating.\n\nMaybe they'd do it anyway, maybe if you said no they'd give up as it was too hard. Maybe if you said no they'd not do anything as you were the only one sexy enough.\n\nIf you're the sort of person who thinks that is ok I'm not going to invite you to parties, not going to be friends with you, I'm going to warn people about your presence. I'm going to advise people not to get drunk with you.

If we use the same categories stated in the article you posted, then black and Hispanic people (combining the two) are 15x more likely to commit murder or non-negligent manslaughter than white people are. Even more on topic, black and Hispanic people are 10x more likely to be arrested for firearm possession than white people are.\n\nSo no, those statistics don't outrage me. "}, {"id": "cmoho4u", "body": "&gt;This is in regards to the stop-and-frisk policy, which seeks to find unregistered firearms on individuals. 9x is a HUGE disparity! I see why people were outraged because of this!\n\nSlightly off topic, here, but the problems involved with stop and frisk wouldn't have happened if \"reasonable suspicion\" had actually been reasonable.  They basically did away with the 4th amendment.  There are three levels of police encounters.  They would have a \"voluntary\" interaction with a citizen (yeah right), then search said person for officer safety.  People are allowed to walk away from a voluntary interaction, negating any officer safety issue.  The ability to walk away was removed by the officer demanding that you stay.  This changes the interaction to a Terry stop... which requires reasonable and articulable suspicion.  From what I can tell, suddenly, upon the implementation of this policy, anything and everything suddenly became reasonable.  \"He looked like a guy who Could have a gun\" was suddenly accepted as reasonable by all the judges?  WTF?  \n\nThe number of people frisked was astronomical.   The fact that no judge called out any of the officers for lack of RAS in any of those 1.x million stops is utterly ridiculous.  Every one of those officers in NYC is a felon.  Title 18 U.S.C section 242 and section 243.  They were the only criminals present during a Vast majority of police interactions in the city during that policy.

Examining end-state incarceration statistics in re: the justice system as a whole is a relevant way of determining whether 'police are racist.' \n\nMaybe this is semantic, but it seems to me like 'the police are racist' when applied in recent conversations usually means something like 'individual policemen use different sets of intuitive rules when encountering black as opposed to white individuals, and the black-person intuitive rules (the young-black-male intuitive rules particularly) tend to be more confrontational, suspicious, violent, exploitative or lethal than the white-person intuitive rules.'\n\nYour logic (whether sound or not) seems more intended to determine 'whether or not black people end up in jail at a rate higher or lower than you'd predict on the basis of income alone.' And the idea is that by answering this question (which you do in the negative) we can get insight into the earlier question. \n\nI'm just not sure that's true--and I'm going to get anecdotal here, so apologies, but--if we look at the three recent police killings that have convinced a lot of people (myself included) that 'police are [often] racist,' we find that literally none of them would show up in the kind of statistics you're examining--Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner never went to jail. They never had the *chance* to go to jail, or not to go to jail, because the officers they interacted with opted for high-violence, high-confrontation conflict-resolution strategies that ended in their actual deaths. Whether they would have done the same to white versions of the same guys is kind of unknowable, but if you look at the #crimingwhilewhite and #alivewhileblack hashtags on twitter you may feel (anecdotally) that 'racism' had something to do with the way that these scenes ended.\n\nThere are other examples--most of the behavior that [strikes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/09/03/how-st-louis-county-missouri-profits-from-poverty/) people in St. Louis as 'racist policing' (but I'll agree could plausibly be read as classist, though like a lot of American classism it seems to be racist in both its origins and its manifestations) is about harassment with civil penalties, tickets, and etc, rather than with arrests and jail times. But the big point is that 'police racism' whether it exists or not (and as a privileged white who's spent time in poor and mostly black communities, I'm pretty sure it does) isn't just a question of who goes to jail. In fact the more relevant cases, as above, may be who *doesn't* go to jail--who's shot in the extreme case, but also who's pulled over for no apparent reason, who's stopped-and-frisked, who's pulled out of a crowd for a patdown or a bag search, who's asked where there going or to get out of the street, who's told their profile matches someone who was described at a recent crime? People in prison generally are people who are found (rightly or wrongly) guilty of breaking the law, but victims of police racism are also people who are found innocent, in court or at the scene, but not before they've been victimized by suspicious, violent and antagonistic cops. I don't have statistics about that, so it may be hard to convince you, but I do hope that you'll agree that just looking at who goes to prison is an incomplete approach to the (real, urgent, deadly) question of racism in American police departments.

Are people who live in cities somehow different biologically or ethically than than suburban or rural people? The null hypothesis should be that crimes are committed at the same rate regardless of location. It would then be up to the police and policies to catch and incarcerate the criminals. If poor urban individuals are more likely to go to prison than poor rural individuals that could very well indicate either racist police or racist policy. \n\nLet's do some light statistical analysis.\n\nWhile it is noble to try to draw very broad conclusions from overall US statistics the devil really is in the details. Since most people are prosecuted in state court, and state laws and procedures vary greatly it makes more sense to look at rates at a more local level. In a very basic search I used Missouri, with of all the recent events there I thought it might be pertinent.   \n\nMissouri's incarceration rates in their top 5 counties can be found [here](http://oseda.missouri.edu/mo_nation/prison_population_2006_2008.shtml). The counties are: Pemiscot, Mississippi, St. Louis City, New Madrid, Saline. (more direct link [here](https://doc.mo.gov/Documents/publications/Offender%20Profile%20FY07.pdf))\n\nOf the top 5 counties with high incarceration rates, four have a population between 13k (Mississippi co.) and 22k (Saline co).  These are not large cities and are significantly more rural than St Louis (pop ~347k). If one were to rank the all the counties of Missouri by percent of population that is African American (found [here](http://oseda.missouri.edu/tables/raceh/mocopop_blacks_co.html)): Pemiscot would be #2 (26% black), Mississippi county would be #4 (20%), St Louis city would be #1(51%), New Madrid would be #6 (15%) and Saline would be #19 (5%). Keep in mind Missouri has 115 counties. \n\nLooking at the poverty rates of counties, (found [here](http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/united-states/quick-facts/missouri/percent-of-people-of-all-ages-in-poverty#table)) if we were to rate all the counties of missouri from most to least % of population in poverty Pemiscot county would be most poor (32% below poverty), Mississippi 2 (28%), St louis city 4 (26%), new Madrid 17 (21%) and Saline 31 (19%). So far the data seems like it may support your argument that poverty leads to higher incarceration rates. But what about the 3rd most poor county? Adair, with the 3rd highest rate of poverty (26%), is 97th in terms of percent of the population that is incarcerated and 51st highest African American population (1%). With Adair's population 22k, it's only 5k more than Pemiscot. (the 5th highest rate of poverty (at 25%) is Wright county, pop 18k, 85th in incarceration rate, 72nd in % black (0.3%). \n\nLooking at the bottom 10 counties for incarceration rates, there are three that fit into the same size catergory we created (13k-23k pop.) These counties are Nodaway, Douglas and Andrew counties (in terms of incarceration rank they are 107, 110 and 113 respectively). In terms percent of the population that identifies as African American they are 50th (1%), 93rd (0.1%), 66th (0.4%) respectively. The rank of their poverty rates are 9th (23%), 11th (22%) and 110th (9%). Andrew county is clearly much better off than the other counties but It would seem that both Nodaway and Douglas have comparable poverty rates to many highly ranked African American Counties but have significantly lower incarceration rates.\n\nClearly wealth does play some roll in incarceration rates, but to make the claim 'there is no racial bias in the system, whether it is the police, the policies in place or the judicial system's enforcement of those laws' is dubious at best. I'm sure a more detailed analysis could be done on these numbers but it's saturday and I have stuff to do.
