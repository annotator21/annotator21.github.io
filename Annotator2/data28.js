There are many animals that are capable of easily eating and thriving off of food that humans would struggle to get enough nutrients from.  As this makes up the bulk of the plants that grow in some areas, this makes raising livestock for food to be the most efficient use of the land for the humans.  If done correctly, this is also better for local wildlife that the humans are not directly interacting with by promoting a greater species diversity of plants and edge effect when compared to traditional monoculture agriculture.  There is also the matter that it is much easier to catch a disease from eating a human than any other animal.  Most animals will have at least some infections or parasites that humans cannot catch, but all such problems that might be in human flesh can be caught by humans.  This is part of the reason that some animals are discouraged from being eaten due to them carrying more things that humans can catch.\n\nThe second issue is a bit more complicated.  You point out that apes can learn sign language, but very few humans eat apes, making it a moot point.  Different species have different levels of intelligence, and there is a tendency for the more intelligent species to be avoided in consumption (at least in the US).  Things like chicken and cattle have much less intelligence than an ape, and so the same argument cannot be applied.  You are right to suggest that it is difficult to draw an objectively distinct line where some animals are clearly separate from others, but so me I see that continuum continue through to plants and fungi.  At no point to I see and objective distinction between the morality of dealing with the more complex plants and the less complex animals.  So, the line must be draw somewhere and as there is no objective criteria, the judgment must be made from a subjective standpoint.  Subjectively, it is incredibly clear that some animals are far less mentally complex than others, and as such the morality of interacting with them must be different.  As there is a contiuum of intelligence, so must there be a continuum of moral standards, ranging from treating them as equals (other humans), to lesser but still with certain rights and respect (other apes and similar intellectual species), to even less but still with a few rights (cattle, goats, etc.), to much lesser with very little rights (most fish, arthropods, etc.) to lacking the need for much more than the basic right to not go extinct (coral, sponges, most plants, etc.)."}, {"id": "2oxhpn", "body": "The difference between humans and other animals is intelligence.

"}, {"id": "cmrnl82", "body": "I understand you have additional concerns about going to college, but do not dismiss the idea of higher education out of fear of being unable to pay off the debt. People who take years upon years to pay off their college debt only do so because of their own failures to plan. \n\nFirst, as others have said here, get a degree that will get you the job you want. I'm not opposed to study for the sake of study, but that's what you do with disposable income. If you have to take a loan to get the education then make sure the degree pays off and study something that will get you hired for a salary that will allow you to have income enough to pay off the debt.\n\nSecond, don't take more debt than you need. Too many students do the whole of their education on loans because college students can get them fairly easily. That's shortsighted. Work as much as you can without your grades suffering during college, and only borrow as much money as necessary. \n\n\nThird, make paying off your debt a priority when you get out of school. Most college students learn the art of getting by on pretty minimal living expenses: Living in cheap apartments with a roommate, eating \"bachelor chow\" cheap food, driving a \"beater\" car / making do with a bus pass, etc. Then people graduate and get jobs, and instead of putting their income towards paying back the debt, they move into nicer homes, they take on more debt by buying nicer cars, and blow through disposable income by buying more expensive food and drastically upping their entertainment budget. Then a decade later they're still complaining about their student loans, when if they'd just spent the first couple years out of school living the same level of lifestyle they were while students and putting the money towards paying back the loans they could have paid the debt off in a very short order."}, {"id": "cmrg5np", "body": "I totally understand you.

Going to college lets you make connections with the next President, or the next great movie director, or the next great artist.\n\nDoes it make sense financially? Statistically, hell yes. Even considering the fact that you're not working for those extra 4 years, college graduates on average earn much more than high school grads over a lifetime. Don't worry about the debt and focus on your passion and what kind of job you want when you graduate. If you get a decent job after you get a degree, you can pay off your debt in months. If you're still worried, apply for scholarships or do work study. I graduated college with $0 in debt.\n\nWhen I was younger, I didn't care about getting a great job because I thought I only needed X amount of money to survive and I'd be happy, but gradually I realized what earning more money implied for me: not having to worry about basic necessities, having free time to do what I want, waking up late and working from home without worrying about losing out on pay and opportunities...etc.\n\nRemember, success is all about connections, not raw intelligence or talent."}, {"id": "cmrg5np", "body": "I totally understand you.

Why do women choose to go into different, and usually lower paying fields? You can't just say they choose differently and leave it at that, all that's doing is kicking the can down the road. It makes sense to stay out of the dangerous manual labor type jobs, because those often require much more physical strength than most women have. But why are there so few women in startups? Technology? Why do women choose to become nurses instead of doctors?\n\nHonestly, I don't know. I'm sure it's a complex interaction of gender roles and physiology. Pregnancy and birth probably play into the decision pretty heavily, since it's very difficult to work a few months to either side of the birth. Culturally, mothers are expected to drive the kids around and take time off for them when necessary, which is a big part of it. On the other side, men are socialized to be breadwinners, and so pay is one of the top priorities when choosing a profession.

A lot of women fail to receive the help that we expect to be available to them.

What is it?\n\nStaring is not a problem of \"objectification,\" which does nothing to actually harm the person being stared at. The real discomfiture of being stared at has to do with being the focus of intense scrutiny and the resulting social pressure. Look into the theory of chilling effects to understand the problem with anyone staring at anyone who is not currently performing. This is why society has long held staring to be a rude behavior.\n\n&gt; *I feel like both women and men are at risk from violence. Although women are at far more risk for rape, and that's much worse emotionally.\n\nWomen are more at risk for rape because rape has been defined in a way that does not count women forcing standard intercourse on men. Including these incidences brings the statistics reasonably close to parity.\n\n&gt; *I think that male victims of rape and domestic abuse are taken less seriously and have fewer available resources.\n\nThis is almost certainly true. I encourage you to look into [Erin Pizzey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey), the woman who established the first shelters for victims of domestic abuse.\n\n&gt; *I'm not sure what the exact problem is with sexualised imagery. What is it? And isn't a problem for both men and women?\n\nThe problem is that it has the potential to create unreasonable standards. This is true of any kind of idealized imagery, and typically ends up having very minor actual effects.\n\n&gt; *I think the gender pay gap is partially caused by difference in occcupations and the tendency for women to spend more time on childcare. I can definitely see a lack of respect for women in the workplace, but I don't think it's the entire cause.\n\nCurrently in the US, childless single women under 30 have the highest average pay out of any demographic broken out under those categories. The pay gap is largely just a statistical phenomenon.\n\nAnd now for the part of your view that needs changing. None of your statements here reflect a hatred of women. They simply disagree with feminist rhetoric. While we expect that misogynists will disagree with feminists on most issues, disagreeing with feminists is not sufficient to render you a misogynist. Certain branches of feminism will attempt to convince you otherwise, as these groups are not above shaming tactics. You have no reason to be ashamed."}, {"id": "2oxf43", "body": "Hi, I'm a mtf transgender person, and my lack of understanding of the female experience is making feel disgusted with myself and want to die.

It would be terrible for you to take all this guilt upon yourself to that extent, when you clearly care a lot about not wanting to be misogynist!\n\nIn my experience, even very open-minded and progressive feminist people can still have a few vaguely misogynistic views lurking subconsciously in the back of their mind.  That doesn't make them bad people, it just means they've been affected by sexism as much as anybody else.  It doesn't matter if your views are perfect.  Everyone has some blind spots, things they don't understand, or things that they just get wrong.  What matters and makes you a better person is whether you're willing to grow and examine yourself when you see you might be wrong.  That sounds exactly like what you're doing here.\n\nFor what it's worth, your views you've put forward also look pretty reasonable.  Especially the one about male victims of abuse not being taken seriously.  You're very right to be concerned about that.  Many feminist groups actively support this view, because the way male victims are treated only perpetuates more sexual stereotypes of how men always need to \"man up\" and not be \"pussies\"... like women.  The bad treatment of male victims is very closely tied to the rigid gender roles feminists seek to break down.\n\nThe only views of yours I'd try and discuss with you more are the ones about the gender pay gap, and sexualized imagery/male staring.  The wage gap is a very complicated issue though, with so many different factors involved.  It's not unreasonable to have doubts about how you feel about it.  The thing that actually gets me mad when people are discussing the wage gap is when they willfully *ignore* the testimonies and experiences that women are telling them about.  But you already acknowledge the lack of respect for women in the workplace.  So as long as you keep an open ear to what other women tell you, you sound fine!\n\nAnd as for the sexualized imagery... sometimes it's very subtle.  I grew up *thinking* I wasn't too affected by sexualized imagery because I didn't see myself as a girly girl, and I thought myself to be above that sort of thing.  But as I grew up, I saw how even that attitude was sexist and unhealthy.  I thought that I had to be \"not girly\" to be taken seriously, because if I acted or looked too feminine, I would be seen as only eye candy.\n\nAs a woman, it can be frustrating when men can't sympathize with things like being sexualized, or brush off things like the wage gap without even considering it.  They simply haven't lived it themselves, so it requires empathy for them to have to think outside of their own experience.  But even women can sometimes be very sexist and misogynist!  Every woman is different, and if they don't have much empathy either, they may have a hard time relating to other women who have faced more discrimination than they have as an individual.  Your experience as a trans woman can actually be very valuable, from getting to see the \"other side\" for a while.\n\nIt sounds like you've grown up with less of the \"female experience\" from others seeing you and treating you as a man as you grew up.  If you've transitioned already or you're planning to soon, you'll probably start to see a lot more of that female experience happening to you.  So just give it time.  Like others have said, reaching out to the rest of the trans community is probably the best move for you.  But I'd be happy to talk more with you too as a cis feminist.  : )"}, {"id": "2oxf43", "body": "Hi, I'm a mtf transgender person, and my lack of understanding of the female experience is making feel disgusted with myself and want to die.

I am so used to thinking of Microsoft as a software company that I totally missed the fact that you are specifically drawing the comparison between Surface and MacBook, and went off on a tangent about Windows v. OS X. In hindsight, that's obvious. Sorry about that. But thanks for the delta anyway!\n\nWell, I own all of the devices in question (Surface 3, iPad Air, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air) and I can tell you that the I do prefer the Surface 3 to the MacBook Air, but I prefer the MBP and the iPad Air to the Surface. I love that the Surface runs full on Windows\u2014playing Civ and using Photoshop is great with the pen once you get the hang of it. But that's pretty much the end of the list of things I love about it. I don't like the feel of the type cover, and overall the device feels like an awkward top-heavy laptop. The screen is in a no-mans land between standard resolution and retina displays, the battery doesn't last as long as I feel like it should and it's always heavier than I expect it to be. There's nothing the Surface does which my desktop PC, my MacBook or my iPad doesn't do better, but on the other hand my Surface can do nearly all the things that those three devices do for me combined, but only costs as much as one of them.\n\nBut I'm unusual... the fact that the MacBook Air is one of my least favorite devices flies in the face of the data you just linked, that the Air is the most popular ultrabook. Most people don't buy all these toys just for the hell of it, and if I was only going to buy *one* device then I absolutely see the appeal of the Surface. But I'm never going to have just one device.\n\nThat said, there is one thing that even people looking for one device might not be able to get over, and that's the awkwardness of the form factor I mentioned earlier. The thing *really* wants to be used on stable, flat surface with the type cover attached. Without the type cover, the onscreen keyboard gets annoying fast. In terms of actually using it, it's not nearly as \"couchable\" as an iPad or even a MacBook. And at the point where you have to use it on a table, why not just get the ultrabook instead and not have to deal with the keyboard tradeoffs?\n\nThe Surface is an exercise in \"almost there.\" Processors and batteries are *almost* small and light and efficient enough to make an x86 PC in the form of a tablet. Windows is *almost* touch friendly enough to be as usable as iOS is on a touchscreen. The type cover is *almost* as good as a real keyboard. And with each iteration of the Surface Microsoft is improving these things, but the problem with playing almost is that Apple is already there and still moving forward. The iPad is *already* the most popular tablet: iOS is just better suited for touchscreen than Windows is. the MacBook Air is *already* the most popular ultrabook: if you're building a productivity device then battery life and a great keyboard are essential, and the Air beats the Surface in these regards.\n\nPerpetually trailing the iPad and MacBook Air isn't good enough, it has to be outright *better* than at least one of them, but that's kinda tough to do when you're aiming for both birds with a single stone. Microsoft makes a device which is pretty good at both of these use cases, but Apple makes a device which is great at one or the other. I think that the end result will be a split market, because different people are going to prefer different approaches.

As a disclaimer, I'm pretty solidly in the apple camp and have been for about 8 years.  Mostly because I do a good bit of what some might call \"creative\" work. I jumped to Apple back when it was the only option for software that I wanted to use. Currently using a 2010 MacBook Pro which (will eventually be replaced either by another 15\" Retina MBP or 13\" Air), iPhone, and I have an iPad 2 that I rarely use. All of that said, I have no problems with non-apple products.\n\n&gt;The Surface Pro 3 is lighter than an 11\" or 13\" MacBook Air and iPad Air 2 combined.\n\nEh, I realize that some people really care about this, but for me, I honestly wouldn't notice the difference that a few ounces make. In the grand scheme of things, would you? I'm not talking like pick up one bag with Macbook + iPad and then immediately put it down and pick up the Surface Pro bag. Then you'd notice. What I mean is, if it is your daily carry, a few ounces don't matter much. Kinda the same idea as going to Best Buy or wherever to look at a new TV. Sure, look at them side by side and you'l see a difference, but get one home and into your living room? It doesn't matter so much.\n\n&gt;The Surface Pro 3 has a pen, which both lack (Apple's strategy is to have excellent touch input). Pen input helps with notes for those who prefer writing, and those who use CAD programs.\n\nI've always struggled a bit with pen input. I really don't see a need for it with the way I use computing devices day-to-day. I'm not in school any longer (gradated college in 2010), and i could see an argument for note taking, particularly with stuff thats difficult to input on a keyboard, but then again, I always prefer taking notes on real paper. Call me old fashioned if you want, but there are dozens of us, DOZENS!\n\n If I were a graphic artist and needed a pen for CAD stuff, I wouldn't be bothering with a pen input built into a phablet. I'd do that work with a real external pad.\n\n&gt;The MacBook Air uses relatively outdated technology to keep battery life long (take a look at the screen!)\n\nHonestly don't know enough about the screen on either device\n\n&gt;Most people I know use touchscreen laptops because they're more convenient.\n\nI just disagree. If I'm sitting at a desk using a computer and keyboard, I want to be able to control the computer with my arms resting. Poking at the screen and lifting my arms up all the time is just tiring. Plus, a good track pad like on the Macbooks is way more precise than a stubby finger anyway.\n\n&gt;The iPad Air 2 is not a reasonable productivity device (however, it's common to see students on my campus with just iPads and poor-quality keyboards attached). It's really a plaything.\n\nNo argument here. But then again, I'd argue that only a full-fledged notebook is a true productivity device. Tablets, and hybrids really fall short in many respects, particularly with smooth multitasking and displaying data from different applications simultaneously.\n\n&gt;MacBooks have a stranglehold on the campus because the student store is aggressively promoting them. However, I have recently seen numerous students switch to Surface for their needs, especially since Microsoft has begun promoting Surface on campus.\n\nNot sure what this has to do with the superiority of either device, honestly. Though I could make the argument that more people buy Apple computers because they feel it suits their needs better.\n\n&gt;If the Windows 10 hype follows through, then Microsoft products will experience a new wave of adoption, including the next generation of Surface.\n\nAgain, not really point in favor of MS or against Apple. Just speculation. \n\nIn general, consumers are driven to buy what they feel works best for them. Marketing plays a big role in that. But if a product fails to deliver on marketing promises, consumers won't come back.\n\nSo basically, the Surface Pro approach works for you. It has the features that matter most to you. But what you value/need in a computing device isn't necessarily what other people value/need in theirs.

I think OP is correct on a lot of points.  Primarily though there is a very important block of young voters who have been royally fucked by: 1) the economy in general 2) universities offering over priced, under performing degrees 3) private and public lenders who give 18 year olds way way more money than they can reasonably be responsible for, and 4) changing times.\n\nThose are the real reason why this student debt issue is such a big deal - because it is horribly, horribly, unfair that a kid, their parents, their friends, the media, everyone, thought the way to a good life was to do well in high school then go to university, get an english degree, and get a reasonable job when they graduated.  They followed the plan and ended up with 120K in debt and working at starbucks.  People are looking around slack jawed still and going \"WTF - how did this happen?\"\n\nThe answer to that question REALLY is that the economy turned, job requirements changed, the world your parents grew up in is not the world we are growing up in.  However the answer that is politically paletable is that there are villians:  Universities that charged 25K a year in tuition for degrees they KNEW would be useless in getting a job.  University presidents who proudly stood up and said their job was not to prepare young minds for work - but to give them some kind of esoteric education and training them to 'think'.  Lenders who allowed these students to borrow huge amounts of money for degrees the lenders knew were useless because they felt the debt was bankruptcy proof.\n\nThat is how you sell this politically - and if there are villains it can't be the public purse that pays: it has to be the villains who are held to account.  So they will allow bankruptcy, sue universities, sue private lenders, and pander to a group of voters who doesn't want to hear that they just made a bad choice (though a choice they really had no way of knowing at 18 years old was a bad one).

[This article seems to detail jobs going into extinction and a lot of these are \"trade\" jobs](http://www.boston.com/jobs/2013/12/30/the-fastest-declining-occupations/PRZVnJg25iIBgJFyv70BxN/story.html#slide-7).       \n\nIf you need a bachelors degree for a simple office job, and other workers are actually going into extinction, I don't think the younger population will be raised as viewing college as a \"special option\" and thus will be less willing to accept student loan debt as a central part of the U.S. economy. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Hospitals regularly give large discounts or free service to people who are poor and uninsured, while the people who have insurance or can otherwise afford to pay are charged the full or nearly full amounts. The higher the sticker price, the more money they're able to capture from their wealthiest patients, while ultimately having little impact on the poorer ones since they don't pay full price anyway.\n\nSince hospitals are private businesses and not the government, that's as close as they can get to a public system funded by progressive taxation.

Once it is on the table to begin with, compromises will become common between politicians unless the population with student debt lowers drastically and stays down.

Here's why:\n\n* $29,000 isn't all that much money. [The average starting salary of a college graduate is ~$45,000/year](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=average%20starting%20salary%20of%20a%20college%20graduate). A college student living on only 2/3 of his income can pay off his loans in 2 years - I'm sure he was living on much less than $30k while in college. America has no sympathy for people who live beyond their means and can't pay their bills. Americans who have, or are currently, sacrificing mightily to pay their student loan payments will never let a very, very small minority off the hook though bankruptcy. \n\n* The vast majority of former students *are* paying their bills. [The rate of default on student loans is 13.7%, meaning that more than 8-out-of-10 former students are paying their bills](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=student%20loan%20default%20rate). So, very conservatively, only 5,480,000 out of your stated 40,000,000 are having problems paying their bills. So, you're talking about roughly 1.5% of the US population. Do you really think that 1.5% of the US population is enough to influence policy? \n\n* The most common way to collect defaulted student loan debt is to withhold tax refunds. [The average tax refund in the US is $3034.00](http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/06/pf/taxes/tax-refund/). During hardship deferral, student loans collect no interest. Therefore, after 10 years of deferral, your tax refund will pay off your student loans. A former student has to do literally nothing, other than allow the government to take slightly more from his paycheck than they would if he had filled out his W-4 in more detail, and his student loans will be paid automatically. America isn't going to stand for a former student getting a large tax refund and then claiming that he can't pay his student loan bills.\n\n* Bankruptcy lets future high-earners off the hook. The reason we don't allow bankruptcy for student loans is that the college experience is not something you can repossess. My brother-in-law is currently in his residency, with ~$200k in debt for medical school. He, by all rights, (given his current income) should be able to declare bankruptcy. But, once he finishes his MD, he'll be making ~$500k/year. Even if his university were to revoke his credentials for non-payment, he would still have the education and the skills to practice medicine. Even if he had to take a severe pay cut because his university revoked his degree, he would still make a tidy salary, and hospitals would quickly realize that having your degree revoked because of bankruptcy doesn't say anything about your credentials as a doctor. Americans would never permit professionals with developed skills and high earning potential to discharge their debts because they aren't *currently* earning to their potential.\n\n* As above, more than 80% of student-debt holders are making their payments. Further, many parents pay for their childrens' education and many students work hard for educational or athletic scholarships. The option of bankruptcy devalues the contribution that these families and students have made to their education. Try telling the parents that have scrimped and saved for decades to pay for their kid's education that his classmate went to college for free because that student declared bankruptcy. Alternately, tell the football player who won a Heisman that he could have just kicked back and partied in the dorms: then declared bankruptcy and ended up the same place. \n\nBankruptcy drops off your credit after 7 years. A former student who declares bankruptcy right out of college could be buying a house or a business before age 30. Given that the top earning decades of a person's life are their 50s, it makes logical sense that *everyone* should rack up as much debt as possible, declare bankruptcy after college, and wait until 30 to start their lives. Of course, that leaves the taxpayers and the parents and the dedicated college students holding the bag: a bag I'm sure they'll never agree to holding.\n\n$1.2 trillion dollars may seem like a lot of money, but the vast majority of people have, or are working at, paying it back. It's a very, very small minority of people who can't handle their student loans, and they're not nearly large enough to influence policy enough to force the rest to pick up the tab.

For the issues you've named, for different reasons, they are not nearly as opposed on the federal level as finance reform, which is what you are talking about, and I am too.  Not sure how old you are, but immigration reform has been a topic for decades now, even Bush junior had an idea that I thought wasn't too bad (one of the very few things I thought was a decent idea that came out of him), but nothing is getting done there.  If you  want to bring up Obama's current intention, ok, that's one man with no chance of reelection.  I would say that is because us as a nation and even more big corporations love the extremely cheap labor they bring with them.  Marijuana legalization has only been gaining traction on state levels, I have heard nothing being introduced on the federal level, but there is another reason I think that is gaining traction, and that is the waning tobacco industry.  Cigarettes are just too readily related to bad health for them to be good business anymore.  And for student loan debt- first let me tell you I too am one feeling the pain, between my wife and I we racked up nearly 80k, the problem here is our country is more run by our economy then it is by our government, and I maintain that money runs our government more then the concerns of us, the people.  The credit industry is second in sleaze only to the insurance industry, and it pours TONS of money into election campaigns.  And on top of the Tons of money it pours in, it is an industry that works harder for the rich then it does anybody else, and by the average persons standards, the majority of Congress is rich.  So the people that make our laws are given money by the industry for their campaigns and they also have a vested interest in seeing that industry do well, because when it does they do.  \nBut that aside, the biggest take away here I think that I want to impress is that industries give tons of money to a few people in hope of getting them elected.  We then elect them because they are the only choices we are presented with (in the media, sure there are other names on the ballot, but you're likely going to vote for one you know).  Those candidates are then not just beholden to those companies for helping get them elected, they know that the way to get reelected is to do right by them so the campaign contributions flow for the next election.  The financial sector doesn't want to give up the billions they have coming from us poor working folk that had to borrow to get a decent job, so they aren't going to support those that want to do that.  I agree that I would like to see student loan reform, but there are other financial reforms that I think need to take place for that to happen.\n\nhttps://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/index.php?cycle=2012\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmrmb39", "body": "&gt; the problem here is our country is more run by our economy then it is by our government,\n\nOfcourse.

Why didn't every student declare bankruptcy just before graduating?"}, {"id": "cms9iuk", "body": "That's simply not the case. You haven't been able to \"bankruptcy\" out of student loans since the early 70s. Beginning then you couldn't forfeit on student loans within the first five years of the debt, and then after that only if you could demonstrate \"undue hardship\" to continue carrying the debt. Those rules were put in place because compared to any previous generation the children of baby boomers went to college in mass. And then a hell of a lot of them just defaulted on the debt. This led to loaners running away from student loans (and was the beginning of the federal government becoming such a big layer in them) because other wise the system would've collapsed. So, if you took student loans, it took a lot of conditions for you to be able to have the debt wiped beginning in 1976.\n\nEssentially that system has been in place for forty years. In the interim some adjustments to the,\"undue hardship\" specifics have been made. Mostly not even adjusting what a hardship is, but which loaners are and are not falling under the umbrella terms. The change you are referring to - the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act - expanded the protection of private borrowers to its highest levels with the express intent of easing dependency on federal loaners to working class students. Loaners who hadn't received that protection previously essentially wouldn't give loans to young people who needed them.

You haven't been able to \"bankruptcy\" out of student loans since the early 70s. Beginning then you couldn't forfeit on student loans within the first five years of the debt, and then after that only if you could demonstrate \"undue hardship\" to continue carrying the debt. Those rules were put in place because compared to any previous generation the children of baby boomers went to college in mass. And then a hell of a lot of them just defaulted on the debt. This led to loaners running away from student loans (and was the beginning of the federal government becoming such a big layer in them) because other wise the system would've collapsed. So, if you took student loans, it took a lot of conditions for you to be able to have the debt wiped beginning in 1976.\n\nEssentially that system has been in place for forty years. In the interim some adjustments to the,\"undue hardship\" specifics have been made. Mostly not even adjusting what a hardship is, but which loaners are and are not falling under the umbrella terms. The change you are referring to - the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act - expanded the protection of private borrowers to its highest levels with the express intent of easing dependency on federal loaners to working class students. Loaners who hadn't received that protection previously essentially wouldn't give loans to young people who needed them.

I feel that climate change is a natural, cyclical phenomenon that humans are simply exaggerating. What I'm skeptical about is the extent to which the problem is human vs. the extent to which it is natural.\n\nI'd like to begin by pointing out that climate change is obviously a cyclical, natural phenomenon as observed through ice ages, interglacial periods, and greenhouse ages, an extremely long-term cycle. Imagine climate change like a [sine curve](https://google.com/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;q=sine+curve&amp;oq=sine+curve&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.1132.3986.0.4134.16.10.2.3.3.0.160.1009.7j3.10.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..1.15.1027.fgfdh2HHjbU#imgdii=_). Yes, I know it wouldn't actually resemble a perfect curve, but I'm generalizing for the purpose of visualization. It is conclusively proven that [surface temperature and ocean temperature has risen](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/) over the last few decades. But is this really *caused* by humans like we are told? Scientific records of surface temperature patterns don't go far enough back to determine if there is or isn't a similar rise/fall over a longer term. Scientists are assuming temperatures were always lower than current, and humans are just now making them rise. How do we know that before 1880 (earliest date in the linked observations) temperatures weren't falling from levels similar to those we experience now? How do we know that this problem takes place in a matter of two or three decades and not a century or two? Perhaps right now, the rising temperatures are simply the result of us living in and observing the naturally occurring rise in the \"sine curve.\" \n\nTwo other pieces of evidence for the natural-phenomenon theory would be our polar ice caps. We were told that the Northern ice cap would be \"ice free\" by 2013. We were also told in 2013 by the [2013 IPCC Climate Report](http://un.org/climatechange/the-science/) that \"It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin...as global mean surface temperature rises.\" Yes, it hit its lowest extent in 2012, but [it has grown larger since then](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2738653/Stunning-satellite-images-summer-ice-cap-thicker-covers-1-7million-square-kilometres-MORE-2-years-ago-despite-Al-Gore-s-prediction-ICE-FREE-now.html). The antarctic also reached [a record all-time high](http://nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum/#.VIi0zzHF9Wg) in sea-ice levels. These two polar ice growths are indicative of A) A natural phenomenon that fluxuates, or B) Earth's natural adaptation and attempt at homeostasis. We have no accurate measurements of arctic and antarctic ice levels from pre 1800's Earth, and thus cannot observe the possibility that *this may have happened before* and it's simply happening again. We, with our new technology of the 20th and 21st Centuries, have stumbled upon what could be a naturally occurring cycle and have quickly labeled it as a global crisis without adequate *long* term observations and evidence. Scientists will not consider the possibility that *this might not be our fault.*\n\nIn addition, I am also skeptical of the extent to which humans are exaggerating this phenomenon. Speaking from personal observation of my area and observation of the weather across the United States, I have observed no climate patterns that could in any way be considered life-threatening or Earth-altering. In 2013, I noticed it was approximately 70 F until mid November, and then in 2014 it was around 40 F in early October. But this and the autumn snowfall in the Northeast this October are the only \"unusual\" climate patterns I've seen, and they are simply *nothing more than an inconvenience.* No sort of humanity-threatening climate patterns have occurred, and no sort of ecosystem-altering weather has stricken the North American area (I am stating this understanding the fact that my area of observation is limited. I am completely open to any sort of unusual climate patterns in any areas redditors may be present). I have seen no compelling evidence whatsoever that climate change, outside of an extremely long-term scale, will pose anything more than an inconvenience. Having to break out your winter clothes in October, or keeping your shorts and tank tops on until November doesn't threaten life as the entirety of Earth knows it. \n\nIt may be annoying, but climate change poses no *threat* to life on Earth, and it is most likely a naturally occurring phenomenon that we have quickly misjudged to be entirely our fault.\n\nEdit: Paragraph spacing\n\nNote: Any responses providing major points and/or refutations would be 100x more helpful with a reliable source or two\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "cmr6z8q", "body": "&gt;I'd like to begin by pointing out that climate change is obviously a cyclical, natural phenomenon as observed through ice ages, interglacial periods, and greenhouse ages, an extremely long-term cycle.\n\nIt is important to note that climate scientists who believe in Human Driven Climate Change (just about all of them, seriously) would agree with you when you say that changes happen and often there will be cyclical patterns. They would generally agree that we are in part of an Ice Age, that there *have been* interglacial periods and that air composition has changed drastically over time.\n\nThe problem, is the *amount of time*. You mention Ice Ages, Interglacial Periods, Natural Cycles of Greenhouse Gasses. Those events take place over **thousands of years** while we are talking about centuries.\n\nWhen a Climate Scientist says that we might experience an increase of 1 degree over a century, we might see the *same difference* between Ice Ages, but the fact that it takes place over 100 years instead of 100x that is an important part of why this is so important now.\n\n&gt;The antarctic also reached a record all-time high in sea-ice levels. These two polar ice growths are indicative of A) A natural phenomenon that fluxuates, or B) Earth's natural adaptation and attempt at homeostasis.\n\nOption A is a possibility and so that is why we look to gather as much information in the past and present as possible. Part of the issue is that if there IS fluctuation, is it dangerous or not.\n\nOption B makes it sound like the Earth is sentient, which it is not.\n\n&gt;Scientists will not consider the possibility that this might not be our fault.\n\nScientists have *definitely* considered this. In fact, up until Climate Change became a popular idea, there was no reason to think that it *was* our fault. The reason that Climate Change is so big now is because the idea *hasn't always been around* and it's a *relatively* new idea.\n\n&gt; In addition, I am also skeptical of the extent to which humans are exaggerating this phenomenon. Speaking from personal observation of my area and observation of the weather across the United States, I have observed no climate patterns that could in any way be considered life-threatening or Earth-altering.\n\nYou have to be aware of a few things.\n\n1) Personal Observation doesn't really have much meaning when you are trying to use it on something so large as \"the weather\". Maybe you are wrong about your observation or maybe it's not making such large changes that you would notice them from year to year.\n\n2) You live in the United States, a country that is (especially in the Northeast but also most everywhere) dominated by a Temperate Climate which continually goes through large variations in temperature from day to day, week to week, month to month. You might live in a location where the environment is more used to fluctuations and doesn't see it as a huge problem... yet. But what if you live in a part of the world where a constant 1 Degree more would mean life or death for your crops. What if your civilization was based around a spring harvest possible because of melting ice caps from mountains, but because of slightly higher temperatures, there was no ice to melt on those mountains. If you lived in *those* places, you might see the effects more and more.\n\n&gt; It may be annoying, but climate change poses no threat to life on Earth\n\nThis is where I have to strongly disagree with you. Evolution takes time and lots of organisms might have difficulty coping with Global Warming.\n\nWould you be bothered if you learned that corals (which have been around for 542 million years) might go completely extinct due to the acification of the oceans due to climate change?\n\nWould it bother you if you learned that phytoplankton (which is responsible for ~50% of the CO2 fixation around the world) might suffer drastically from the acidification of the oceans?\n\nWhat about all of the organisms that have adapted to live in certain climates that within the next 100 years might drastically change? Maybe their ecosystem no longer exists, or maybe other organisms that couldn't go there before suddenly CAN go there and cause havoc."}, {"id": "cmrbnic", "body": "Thanks for this.

We don't have sufficient evidence to know whether it is or not yet, so we assume it is (naturally).\n\nWell first of all, as you rightly point out... something so severe it is almost mandatory to consider the worst case scenario. After all, Climate Change could literally make life impossible for us in the very long haul.\n\nSecond of all, we *know* that there are lots of ecosystems that are currently suffering heavily with the *fast* changes (remember we are talking 100 years in what used to take more like 1,000-10,000 years). If you are interested, you can read many many articles about how several ecosystems are facing dire consequences *already* because they exist within a small margin of error.\n\n&gt;This causes us (at least environmentalists in the U.S.) to try and make fixes too quickly.\n\nThis is a serious problem with the Climate Change Deniers. We aren't talking about making fixes too quickly. *We are already behind the curve*. Since the Industrial Revolution, we have been affecting the Earth's overall ecosystem more and more, but we only recognized it recently. The changes that are coming \"too quick\" *probably* should have been done about 100 years ago, but we didn't know any better. We have to enact them **now** because just like humans are *always* prone to do, we waited until \"shit hit the fan\".\n\n&gt;We can't leave oil dependency for green energy overnight.\n\nThat is an excellent point. It is the reason why there is such a PUSH to get those things *started* now. Nuclear Power plants generally take 10-20 years to get from the approval stage to building to working.\n\nWe are very dependent on Fossil Fuels, so we need to *start* getting ourselves off of it, but like you said, it is hard. That is why President Obama committed that program where we helped fund Renewable Energy Companies. Some of them succeeded, some of them failed, but it was used as a HUGE campaign message *against* Obama (Remember Solyndra?). We need to fund these technologies so they become efficient enough to make the public sector be interested, and we need to start putting the technology (like Car Charging Stations) to use so people HAVE a reason to buy the cars.\n\nYou need to have the Car Charging Stations *before* people will consider buying the cars, because they need somewhere to charge if they want to use them. That is why we are working on our infrastructure.\n\n&gt;Also, for your bigger points, do you think you could provide some sources?\n\nSure, I'm sure I could find some stuff if you really want.

Yes, I know it wouldn't actually resemble a perfect curve, but I'm generalizing for the purpose of visualization. It is conclusively proven that [surface temperature and ocean temperature has risen](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/) over the last few decades. But is this really *caused* by humans like we are told? Scientific records of surface temperature patterns don't go far enough back to determine if there is or isn't a similar rise/fall over a longer term. Scientists are assuming temperatures were always lower than current, and humans are just now making them rise. How do we know that before 1880 (earliest date in the linked observations) temperatures weren't falling from levels similar to those we experience now? How do we know that this problem takes place in a matter of two or three decades and not a century or two? Perhaps right now, the rising temperatures are simply the result of us living in and observing the naturally occurring rise in the \"sine curve.\" \n\nTwo other pieces of evidence for the natural-phenomenon theory would be our polar ice caps. We were told that the Northern ice cap would be \"ice free\" by 2013. We were also told in 2013 by the [2013 IPCC Climate Report](http://un.org/climatechange/the-science/) that \"It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin...as global mean surface temperature rises.\" Yes, it hit its lowest extent in 2012, but [it has grown larger since then](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2738653/Stunning-satellite-images-summer-ice-cap-thicker-covers-1-7million-square-kilometres-MORE-2-years-ago-despite-Al-Gore-s-prediction-ICE-FREE-now.html).

But this and the autumn snowfall in the Northeast this October are the only \"unusual\" climate patterns I've seen, and they are simply *nothing more than an inconvenience.* No sort of humanity-threatening climate patterns have occurred, and no sort of ecosystem-altering weather has stricken the North American area (I am stating this understanding the fact that my area of observation is limited.

You will not see that claimed in any climate publication.  We are well aware that the temperature has absolutely been higher than this in the past.  So have the CO2 levels.  The concern is not over how hot it is.  It's over how QUICKLY it's rising.  The planet can handle 10 degrees warmer just fine.  So could humanity.  It's the rate at which it's rising that's the problem.

CO2 and other gases cause longwave radiation to be trapped in the earth system, much like a blanket.  If there is a thicker blanket, the planet will stay warmer.  This is known.  We know that the CO2 level is rising, therefore we expect the temperature to rise.  And it is.  It isn't that we're just seeing rising temperatures and saying \"Must be us that's doing it...\"  We know *exactly* why it's happening.  The theory matches the observation.

Imagine climate change like a [sine curve](https://google.com/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;q=sine+curve&amp;oq=sine+curve&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.1132.3986.0.4134.16.10.2.3.3.0.160.1009.7j3.10.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..1.15.1027.fgfdh2HHjbU#imgdii=_).

But is this really *caused* by humans like we are told? Scientific records of surface temperature patterns don't go far enough back to determine if there is or isn't a similar rise/fall over a longer term. Scientists are assuming temperatures were always lower than current, and humans are just now making them rise. How do we know that before 1880 (earliest date in the linked observations) temperatures weren't falling from levels similar to those we experience now? How do we know that this problem takes place in a matter of two or three decades and not a century or two? Perhaps right now, the rising temperatures are simply the result of us living in and observing the naturally occurring rise in the \"sine curve.\" \n\nTwo other pieces of evidence for the natural-phenomenon theory would be our polar ice caps. We were told that the Northern ice cap would be \"ice free\" by 2013. We were also told in 2013 by the [2013 IPCC Climate Report](http://un.org/climatechange/the-science/) that \"It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin...as global mean surface temperature rises.\" Yes, it hit its lowest extent in 2012, but [it has grown larger since then](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2738653/Stunning-satellite-images-summer-ice-cap-thicker-covers-1-7million-square-kilometres-MORE-2-years-ago-despite-Al-Gore-s-prediction-ICE-FREE-now.html). The antarctic also reached [a record all-time high](http://nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum/#.VIi0zzHF9Wg) in sea-ice levels. These two polar ice growths are indicative of A) A natural phenomenon that fluxuates, or B) Earth's natural adaptation and attempt at homeostasis. We have no accurate measurements of arctic and antarctic ice levels from pre 1800's Earth, and thus cannot observe the possibility that *this may have happened before* and it's simply happening again. We, with our new technology of the 20th and 21st Centuries, have stumbled upon what could be a naturally occurring cycle and have quickly labeled it as a global crisis without adequate *long* term observations and evidence.

Speaking from personal observation of my area and observation of the weather across the United States, I have observed no climate patterns that could in any way be considered life-threatening or Earth-altering. In 2013, I noticed it was approximately 70 F until mid November, and then in 2014 it was around 40 F in early October. But this and the autumn snowfall in the Northeast this October are the only \"unusual\" climate patterns I've seen, and they are simply *nothing more than an inconvenience.* No sort of humanity-threatening climate patterns have occurred, and no sort of ecosystem-altering weather has stricken the North American area (I am stating this understanding the fact that my area of observation is limited.

I have seen no compelling evidence whatsoever that climate change, outside of an extremely long-term scale, will pose anything more than an inconvenience. Having to break out your winter clothes in October, or keeping your shorts and tank tops on until November doesn't threaten life as the entirety of Earth knows it. \n\nIt may be annoying, but climate change poses no *threat* to life on Earth, and it is most likely a naturally occurring phenomenon that we have quickly misjudged to be entirely our fault.\n\nEdit: Paragraph spacing\n\nNote: Any responses providing major points and/or refutations would be 100x more helpful with a reliable source or two\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Arctic ice extent in '13 and '14 was still in the 10 lowest ever recorded.\n\n&gt;The antarctic also reached a record all-time high in sea-ice levels.\n\nThe increase in sea ice in the Antarctic is believed to be due mainly to changes in wind patterns in the region. It doesn't disprove global warming, especially when you consider that several regions of Antarctic land ice are [melting rapidly](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140515090934.htm).\n\n&gt;We have no accurate measurements of arctic and antarctic ice levels from pre 1800's Earth, and thus cannot observe the possibility that this may have happened before and it's simply happening again.\n\nNo, but we do have ice cores for some regions, so we know that ice that is hundreds or thousands of years old is melting. For example, Larsen B, which collapsed in 2002, had been stable for at least 12,000 years.\n\n&gt;Scientists will not consider the possibility that this might not be our fault.\n\nEh, I don't get the impression that you know much about the history of climate science. Arrhenius first proposed that human emissions could affect the climate in the 1890s, and for most of the 20th century scientists thought the idea was ridiculous. It wasn't until the 60s and 70s that the majority of scientists started to realize that he was right, and they have examined (and continue to examine) many alternate explanations for the warming.\n\nThe thing you seem to be missing in your understanding of climate science is that \"natural climate cycles\" don't just happen. There are physical things that make them change. For example, the ice ages were caused by changes in the Earth's orbit called the Milankovich Cycles. The so-called Little Ice Age I mentioned above (which wasn't a true ice age) was caused by a period of extremely low solar activity called the Maunder Minimum. \n\nThere is no known natural force that can account for the recent warming. After an increase in activity following the end of the Little Ice Age, the sun has been stable or cooling again since the 1970s. Volcanic activity has been average. We're in a cooling phase of the Milankovich Cycles. Etc. \n\nSo the cause of the warming has to be anthropogenic greenhouse gases by simple elimination alone. BUT, because scientists are scientists, they've also checked to make sure that the warming behaves in the way you would expect warming caused by greenhouse gases to behave, and it does. For example, if the sun were causing the warming, you would expect temperatures to rise faster during the day and in summer. That's not happening. Instead, they're rising faster at night and in winter, which is consistent with warming caused by something that TRAPS heat, like greenhouse gases. Just to name one example.\n\n&gt;Speaking from personal observation of my area and observation of the weather across the United States, I have observed no climate patterns that could in any way be considered life-threatening or Earth-altering.\n\nWe're still in the relatively early stages of warming - about 0.8&amp;deg;C since the late 19th century. The severe \"life-threatening or Earth-altering\" effects are projected at higher levels of change, and getting increasingly worse the warmer it gets. 2 degrees (the temperature scientists expect us to reach by 2100 if we act promptly to reduce emissions) is likely to be bad but manageable (and with certain regions even experiencing benefits). 4 degrees (the temperature we're likely to reach on a business-as-usual scenario) is likely to be catastrophic pretty much everywhere due to the high degree of instability it would introduce to the Earth's systems.\n\nYou might find this helpful to get an idea of some of the changes expected over the coming decades and centuries in your region: http://www.globalchange.gov/explore/"}, {"id": "cmr96ne", "body": "&gt;It is conclusively proven that surface temperature and ocean temperature has risen over the last few decades.

The Earth has in fact been far warmer than it currently is, as you can see in the graph linked above.\n\n&gt;We were told that the Northern ice cap would be \"ice free\" by 2013.\n\nSource? Because the soonest estimate I've seen from a reputable scientist was 2014-2019, and the funny thing about that is that his estimate was very nearly correct, and may yet prove to be completely correct.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/2myzx2/why_doesnt_everyone_believe_humans_are_causing/cm91xdg\n\n&gt;Yes, it hit its lowest extent in 2012, but it has grown larger since then.\n\nIf you get an F in school one year and a D the next, do you trumpet your STUNNING RECOVERY? Arctic ice extent in '13 and '14 was still in the 10 lowest ever recorded.\n\n&gt;The antarctic also reached a record all-time high in sea-ice levels.\n\nThe increase in sea ice in the Antarctic is believed to be due mainly to changes in wind patterns in the region. It doesn't disprove global warming, especially when you consider that several regions of Antarctic land ice are [melting rapidly](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140515090934.htm).\n\n&gt;We have no accurate measurements of arctic and antarctic ice levels from pre 1800's Earth, and thus cannot observe the possibility that this may have happened before and it's simply happening again.\n\nNo, but we do have ice cores for some regions, so we know that ice that is hundreds or thousands of years old is melting. For example, Larsen B, which collapsed in 2002, had been stable for at least 12,000 years.\n\n&gt;Scientists will not consider the possibility that this might not be our fault.\n\nEh, I don't get the impression that you know much about the history of climate science. Arrhenius first proposed that human emissions could affect the climate in the 1890s, and for most of the 20th century scientists thought the idea was ridiculous. It wasn't until the 60s and 70s that the majority of scientists started to realize that he was right, and they have examined (and continue to examine) many alternate explanations for the warming.\n\nThe thing you seem to be missing in your understanding of climate science is that \"natural climate cycles\" don't just happen. There are physical things that make them change. For example, the ice ages were caused by changes in the Earth's orbit called the Milankovich Cycles. The so-called Little Ice Age I mentioned above (which wasn't a true ice age) was caused by a period of extremely low solar activity called the Maunder Minimum. \n\nThere is no known natural force that can account for the recent warming. After an increase in activity following the end of the Little Ice Age, the sun has been stable or cooling again since the 1970s. Volcanic activity has been average. We're in a cooling phase of the Milankovich Cycles. Etc. \n\nSo the cause of the warming has to be anthropogenic greenhouse gases by simple elimination alone. BUT, because scientists are scientists, they've also checked to make sure that the warming behaves in the way you would expect warming caused by greenhouse gases to behave, and it does. For example, if the sun were causing the warming, you would expect temperatures to rise faster during the day and in summer. That's not happening. Instead, they're rising faster at night and in winter, which is consistent with warming caused by something that TRAPS heat, like greenhouse gases. Just to name one example.\n\n&gt;Speaking from personal observation of my area and observation of the weather across the United States, I have observed no climate patterns that could in any way be considered life-threatening or Earth-altering.\n\nWe're still in the relatively early stages of warming - about 0.8&amp;deg;C since the late 19th century. The severe \"life-threatening or Earth-altering\" effects are projected at higher levels of change, and getting increasingly worse the warmer it gets. 2 degrees (the temperature scientists expect us to reach by 2100 if we act promptly to reduce emissions) is likely to be bad but manageable (and with certain regions even experiencing benefits). 4 degrees (the temperature we're likely to reach on a business-as-usual scenario) is likely to be catastrophic pretty much everywhere due to the high degree of instability it would introduce to the Earth's systems.\n\nYou might find this helpful to get an idea of some of the changes expected over the coming decades and centuries in your region: http://www.globalchange.gov/explore/"}, {"id": "cmrbc2q", "body": "Most of your response provides sources and backup to your claims, which is exactly what I was looking for, so thank you.

I feel that climate change is a natural, cyclical phenomenon that humans are simply exaggerating. What I'm skeptical about is the extent to which the problem is human vs. the extent to which it is natural.\n\nI'd like to begin by pointing out that climate change is obviously a cyclical, natural phenomenon as observed through ice ages, interglacial periods, and greenhouse ages, an extremely long-term cycle. Imagine climate change like a [sine curve](https://google.com/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;q=sine+curve&amp;oq=sine+curve&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.1132.3986.0.4134.16.10.2.3.3.0.160.1009.7j3.10.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..1.15.1027.fgfdh2HHjbU#imgdii=_). Yes, I know it wouldn't actually resemble a perfect curve, but I'm generalizing for the purpose of visualization. It is conclusively proven that [surface temperature and ocean temperature has risen](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/) over the last few decades. But is this really *caused* by humans like we are told? Scientific records of surface temperature patterns don't go far enough back to determine if there is or isn't a similar rise/fall over a longer term. Scientists are assuming temperatures were always lower than current, and humans are just now making them rise. How do we know that before 1880 (earliest date in the linked observations) temperatures weren't falling from levels similar to those we experience now? How do we know that this problem takes place in a matter of two or three decades and not a century or two? Perhaps right now, the rising temperatures are simply the result of us living in and observing the naturally occurring rise in the \"sine curve.\" \n\nTwo other pieces of evidence for the natural-phenomenon theory would be our polar ice caps. We were told that the Northern ice cap would be \"ice free\" by 2013. We were also told in 2013 by the [2013 IPCC Climate Report](http://un.org/climatechange/the-science/) that \"It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin...as global mean surface temperature rises.\" Yes, it hit its lowest extent in 2012, but [it has grown larger since then](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2738653/Stunning-satellite-images-summer-ice-cap-thicker-covers-1-7million-square-kilometres-MORE-2-years-ago-despite-Al-Gore-s-prediction-ICE-FREE-now.html). The antarctic also reached [a record all-time high](http://nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum/#.VIi0zzHF9Wg) in sea-ice levels. These two polar ice growths are indicative of A) A natural phenomenon that fluxuates, or B) Earth's natural adaptation and attempt at homeostasis. We have no accurate measurements of arctic and antarctic ice levels from pre 1800's Earth, and thus cannot observe the possibility that *this may have happened before* and it's simply happening again. We, with our new technology of the 20th and 21st Centuries, have stumbled upon what could be a naturally occurring cycle and have quickly labeled it as a global crisis without adequate *long* term observations and evidence. Scientists will not consider the possibility that *this might not be our fault.*\n\nIn addition, I am also skeptical of the extent to which humans are exaggerating this phenomenon. Speaking from personal observation of my area and observation of the weather across the United States, I have observed no climate patterns that could in any way be considered life-threatening or Earth-altering. In 2013, I noticed it was approximately 70 F until mid November, and then in 2014 it was around 40 F in early October. But this and the autumn snowfall in the Northeast this October are the only \"unusual\" climate patterns I've seen, and they are simply *nothing more than an inconvenience.* No sort of humanity-threatening climate patterns have occurred, and no sort of ecosystem-altering weather has stricken the North American area (I am stating this understanding the fact that my area of observation is limited. I am completely open to any sort of unusual climate patterns in any areas redditors may be present). I have seen no compelling evidence whatsoever that climate change, outside of an extremely long-term scale, will pose anything more than an inconvenience. Having to break out your winter clothes in October, or keeping your shorts and tank tops on until November doesn't threaten life as the entirety of Earth knows it. \n\nIt may be annoying, but climate change poses no *threat* to life on Earth, and it is most likely a naturally occurring phenomenon that we have quickly misjudged to be entirely our fault.\n\nEdit: Paragraph spacing\n\nNote: Any responses providing major points and/or refutations would be 100x more helpful with a reliable source or two\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Natural resources are all good and fine, but these companies rarely have any sort of care for the environment they are destroying and do not have to live with it afterwards. Media companies profit from controversy not truth, so they are often misrepresenting the facts to generate undue conflict. But the average worker who takes a material and makes clothes? There are so many ways their input into the system exceeds their earnings, from spending their money mostly to 0 every week putting all that money back into the system, to cementing ongoing demand for products.

Well, reasons could serve the role of making a combination of atoms in one's mind, a thought, constitute a reason to believe another thought, since it is hard to see how one combination of atoms could justify another combination of atoms, taken alone. Such a bare combination of atoms might cause another combination of atoms, but that is not the same as there being a reason for one thought to imply another. So there's a case to be made that naturalism of the relevant sort is self refuting, or at least that the claim that naturalism is rational is self refuting.\n\nAnother issue is that in the absence of objective reasons, there is no reason to do anything. This is a stronger claim than moral subjectivists usually make - they usually claim that there is no objective reason to do anything, but not that there is no reason, since they think that our desires serve as reasons. But a desire whose object is not a reason to act is presumably not itself a reason to act. So subjectivism leaves us without any reason to do anything, which no one believes.\n\nMy point here is that there is a non-theological case to be made for a version of objective morality that could lead to natural rights if it were worked out more."}, {"id": "cmr0q1q", "body": "How about:\nA claim to man made rights is useless without a grounding in non-man made rights.\n\nEdit:\n\nHow about:\nA cop can do certain things because of laws.

The equipment is given to local police forces though, and why would they all unite against their neighbors?  I would argue the opposite: that the equipment actually better arms the common man against the federal government.\n\nThe best argument against \"militarization\" that I've heard was in Dan Carlin's Common Sense [podcast](http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/) Ep 279.  He says just the optics of it are bad.  If Ferguson's black residents feel that the police are more like an occupying force than it is their neighbors protecting them, adding tanks does not dispel that notion.

He knows damn well he doesn't know what he's doing, so he puts on this gear to trick everyone into believing he does.  In the process, he usually tricks *himself*.  A fucking \"combat cook\" puts on that gear and thinks he's a MARSOC Delta Team Six superwarrior.\n\nThat's not as much of a problem for the military because there are competent, level-headed and experienced people who can tell that guy to stop being a dumbass and that can take charge when shit gets real.  *The cops don't have that.*. They put on all that gear, think they're highly-trained professionals after a two-week SWAT seminar at the Tulsa Marriott and then just start doing what they imagine a SWAT team or crowd control team would do.  They do the wrong thing, then they panic because the thing they were taught at the seminar didn't work.  They get frustrated and start beating the shit out of people instead of trying to deescalate.\n\nSo what I'm saying is that the cops getting this gear are a bunch of \"gear queers\" with nobody to call them on their shit.  They don't need that gear and giving it to them gives them delusions of power, authority and competency that are generally counterproductive.\n\n*PS - If anyone wants to stomp on my balls for saying \"queers\" in that way, remember that I'm just reporting what the term is. Have the argument with someone else.*"}, {"id": "cmrlft3", "body": "I'm not an expert, so I'll definitely defer to those that are more knowledgeable.

All you need for \"SWAT resources\" (whatever those are) are money in the budget and someone willing to sell it to you.  Police don't need to ask anyone before they buy cheap rifles and tactical gear and start calling themselves a SWAT team.  I would like a source from you that shows any required standard for what a SWAT team is.  What are the required training standards?  What do you have to have or be to be called a SWAT team?  The answer is that you need to claim you are a SWAT team. A sheriff and his deputy in Bumfuck, Wyoming can buy themselves a couple of surplus flak vests and a pair of M4s and call themselves a SWAT team and they won't be wrong by any legal standard.\n\nSo by all means, show me a standard of training for SWAT teams.  Show me a required certification or any industry standard.  Because as my later posts attest, I worked with these officers in a training capacity.  Many were essentially self-trained or had conducted expensive but brief training paid for by DHS grants; which is not a substitute for consistent, professional training.\n\nSWAT teams that are actually needed (big cities mostly) are generally good at what they do because they are *professional*.  Circumstances made them necessary long before departments had easy access to this gear and that need and the expense of the gear compelled professionalism and investment in training.  The rural or suburban Keystone Kops SWAT teams are what I'm talking about.  As in the idiots in Ferguson with thousand dollar sights (that the Marine Corps couldn't afford) *mounted backwards* on rifles that should never have been taken out of storage.\n\n&gt;Beyond that, you don't really address the OP's question/point. You ramble on about gear queers, and how they're not qualified. But you ignore the fact that many departments require either military experience or a bachelor's these days.\n\nOP gave me a delta, so I think I did address the question pretty well.  If you think I rambled, I don't think that's my problem; I apologize if analogies aren't your thing.  There was a pretty simple logical pattern: I pointed out an analogous problem in the military and used it to describe the problem with police having easy access to this gear.  I find that most people enjoy analogies, but to each their own.\n\nAs to the military or bachelor's problem, that varies wildly across the country.  But what you ought to remember is that most of the military does not use that gear on a regular basis.  Most of the military are support personnel; cooks, techs, maintenance and admin.  Very few are professionally trained to use the gear in question in a crowd-control or riot situation.  I can tell you by way of anecdote (take it or leave it, I don't much care to argue past this comment) that many infantrymen I know who tried to be cops were rejected over concerns about violence.  Considering they're the ones with the most experience using that gear...\n \nMore to the point, the *military is not a police force*.  The training they receive is not police training.  Ten years as a water tech or combat cook does not make me an expert in the employment of armored vehicles in crowd control situations, nor does it make me a competent SWAT officer or even an patrol officer.  The fact that military members can look at what was done in Ferguson or even Boston after the bombings and see serious problems with use of force is not an argument from authority on police work, it's an argument based on familiarity with combat areas and a recognition that many of the tactics used by these police would be bad ideas *even in combat areas*.  The fact that they're being used against American citizens is disturbing because it's unnecessary and illogical.\n\n&gt;If you're addressing OP's question of the problems of militarization of police, you're demonstrably wrong. A significant number of LEOs working with this surplus equipment is ex military. There is nothing to suggest otherwise.\n\nHow does that remotely suggest that I'm wrong?  The military uses this equipment for a very different purpose than police and being in the military is not sufficient training for this purpose.  I was in the infantry.  That should make me a possible SWAT candidate who could be retrained to do that job, it does not qualify me to start that job tomorrow or after a two-week seminar at the Marriott.  It may qualify me to put on tactical gear with other patrol officers and take up a post in Ferguson, but my first question on the job would've been: \"Why the fuck are we putting all this shit on trying to make a show of force when the people out there are pissed off over excessive force?  Does this seem like a bad idea to anyone else?  Can we maybe try a little dialogue and community outreach like we did in Afghanistan?  Because that worked pretty well then and those folks were way more hostile than these people.\""}, {"id": "2ovqav", "body": "I would agree that we should not have this much surplus military equipment, but without addressing that concern, what else is the military to do with the equipment?  Is it better to lock it up in boxes or sell it to foreign countries?\n\nWont the government be able to squash and oppress the citizenry by using this equipment?  The equipment is given to local police forces though, and why would they all unite against their neighbors?  I would argue the opposite: that the equipment actually better arms the common man against the federal government.\n\nThe best argument against \"militarization\" that I've heard was in Dan Carlin's Common Sense [podcast](http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/) Ep 279.  He says just the optics of it are bad.  If Ferguson's black residents feel that the police are more like an occupying force than it is their neighbors protecting them, adding tanks does not dispel that notion.  While I agree that this point is good, it does not have enough weight to it to justify throwing the equipment away, selling it to other countries, or leaving it in the federal governments hands.\n\nEDIT: /u/grunt08 cmv.
