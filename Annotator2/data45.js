In this case, to not quit.\n\nSecondly, the drugs are using neurochemicals to trick their way into your most basic instincts. Trying to quit a drug is literally as difficult, if not moreso, than trying to eat or breathe as far as your brain is concerned. Have you ever not eaten for a few weeks/months, or not breathed for a few minutes? You can tame that for a bit, but after a while, *every fiber of your being* cries out for air or food, to the point where you will literally kill to get some. And in the cases of food and air, that is a legitimate survival response. That is the danger of addiction: it is fooling your brain into wanting the drugs *more than food or air*. Consider now that your brain is the bit of you that can weigh your choices.\n\nI posit that if you think that being unable to quit addictions cold-turkey is a sign of a weak will, I posit that you should be able to willingly refuse to eat for 2 months, to prove that your will is strong."}, {"id": "cmmcr2j", "body": "Food is necessary to my well being, without it, I will die.

Just an enthusiastic lifelong, self-proclaimed student of science.\n\nWhen talking about addiction, science is really in the dark about a lot of what is going on because we still have no idea how the human brain, where addiction is believed to take place, could possible function. That being said, there are some things that science can tell us. I'll just go into two, genetics and the brain but there are more if you research further.\n\nGenetics is a fairly new science so more research needs to be done to completely prove many theories, but we think we know essentially how it works. When looking at lineage, trends can clearly be seen in traits past down from parent to child, even when the two never meet. This shows us that something else must be going on biologically in the genetic makeup of a species, in this case humans. In short, children of alcoholic parents tend to have higher rates of alcoholism themselves, even though they see what it does at its worst. Something else must be causing this and many scientists are looking into the DNA make up because that is the thing that is passed on in every circumstance.\n\nThe other part is how drugs can change the brain. One way is in the limbic system. This is where the reward system of the brain works. It's how we know that sex with someone is going to be awesome because it was the last time i felt it. It gave me awesome pleasure and my brain is telling me to do it again. In the beginning of addiction this is done small and suddenly until people become chemically dependent on the activity, ie. drugs, gambling, sex, video games, because the brain is telling them to just as strong as it tells you to eat and drink, if not more. \n\nHope this helped but you can read more here...\n\nhttp://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/sciofaddiction.pdf\n\nhttp://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genes/\n\nTLDR; Addiction is more complex then humans have ever known in history until recent science advances."}, {"id": "2oec9w", "body": "I don't believe there's anything other than a question of pure willpower when it comes to kicking addictions like meth, cocaine, food, opium, krocodil, alcohol, etc. I believe if you cannot quit these things cold-turkey, your willpower is essentially weak.

That's the most powerful stimulator to repeated patterns of life that there is.  Now, you find a shortcut to that dopamine, through drugs/food/etc.  You are rewarded when you do them.

Remember, this is the most powerful stimulator for living that there is, and now it's being used in a way that is unintended.  If you stop, you lose the reward.  Your body's chemistry is changed from the addiction and the loss of the dopamine release causes your body to crave and sink into a depressed state without them.  It's hard because dopamine is the end all be all for continued existence being worth it.  Trying to live without that dopamine release you are used to is hard because it's like ignoring the benefits of living.  You know that it's better this way, but your body does not.

I don't see the difference between the world as it is and an an-cap society in general. An organization known as \"The United States\", and before that, the 13 colonies, declared ownership of large swaths of property and declared it as its own. The United States then re-sells this property to its citizens with strings-attached contracts. Hell, condo owners are forced to pay maintenance fees. US citizens are also forced to pay a fee for having land and making money within the United States. You were never sold that property unconditionally. \"Oh, but I never signed an explicit contract!\" Well, you have exactly as much protection from bad contracts in the real world as you do in the Anarcho Capitalist world: Zero. It's too bad you aren't rich enough to afford protection for your rights. \n\n\nAlso, every US citizen is free to leave the territory of the United States for better pastures elsewhere. It just so happens that better pastures have also been declared as owned by other groups of people known as \"nations\". Moreover, the United States oftentimes makes contractual agreements with its neighbors to extradite criminals. In the AnCap society, the exact same kind of agreements can be made. These nations re-sell their own property through a similar contractual system. Their citizens are also free to leave (or at least most of them) for better pastures, if they can find them. \n\n\n\n**All An-cappers want to do is hit a magical reset button to destroy government and let it reform under a different name.** Maybe they'll call it a homeowner's association. Maybe they'll call it a corporation. They want to hit the reset button, because this time around, maybe they can then grab a bigger piece for themselves. \n\n\nAn-Cappers might object to my criticism because the last time our world was formed, violence and aggression was \"legal\" and \"allowed\". Well, violence and aggression obviously will not magically disappear the second time around when they hit the reset button. Without a monopolizing, governing body to restrict or regulate violence, then nothing will be different the second time around. Bad corporations/businesses/governments will do bad things, and nobody will be there to stop it, just like since the dawn of human history. Everyone can even agree that bad things are bad or that aggression is bad, but they'll just go ahead and do it anyways when it just so happens to help themselves. All the social ostracism in the *world*, quite literally, hasn't made North Korea or Iran or any other dictator change their evil ways. It surely wouldn't work after the An-caps hit their reset button. \n_____\n\n\nThe Ancap utopia has no differences whatsoever to the world as it is today. As in our world, there is no governing authority that demands that everybody follow the Non-Aggression-Principle or that people respect each others rights. Without enforcement, everybody will just do whatever they want to. Bad people will do bad things if they can get away with it. Power will be conglomerated eventually into super-corporations that would eventually resemble the governments we see today. Just like our own world, after the big corporations have seized all the valuable property, they can then govern however the fuck they please. \"My House, My Rules. If you don't like it, then just get off of my property!\" Eventually, after the corporations have taken over, the next generation of anarcho capitalists will grumble about how evil their new corporate/government overlords are. They too want to hit that reset button again.\n\n\nThe only difference between the Ancap utopia and our own world is that, in the Ancap society, everyone nearly homogeneously believes in Ancap principles, asides from a few troublemakers. \n\n\nBut we already live in their world.

If freedom were restricted to a certain time or space then it's not true freedom-just like anarchy,it is timeless and eternal. I think it was Colin Ward that gave the analogy of anarchy being like snow covered ground. That the degree of anarchy ebbs and flows  just like the way snow may recede or cover ground that is always  there. He also felt that we also already live in anarchist world. It's also very empowering to know that you don't have to wait for any referendum or for any majority rule for you to step into an anarchist society-\"Anarchy is spread upon the earth and men do not see it\"(apologies to Jesus of Nazareth). What would it take for you to be free-a free society? No. Wasn't that the whole point of Shawshank Redemption and practically every movie that deals seriously with the issue of prison.

I don't see the difference between the world as it is and an an-cap society in general. An organization known as \"The United States\", and before that, the 13 colonies, declared ownership of large swaths of property and declared it as its own. The United States then re-sells this property to its citizens with strings-attached contracts. Hell, condo owners are forced to pay maintenance fees. US citizens are also forced to pay a fee for having land and making money within the United States. You were never sold that property unconditionally. \"Oh, but I never signed an explicit contract!\" Well, you have exactly as much protection from bad contracts in the real world as you do in the Anarcho Capitalist world: Zero. It's too bad you aren't rich enough to afford protection for your rights. \n\n\nAlso, every US citizen is free to leave the territory of the United States for better pastures elsewhere. It just so happens that better pastures have also been declared as owned by other groups of people known as \"nations\". Moreover, the United States oftentimes makes contractual agreements with its neighbors to extradite criminals. In the AnCap society, the exact same kind of agreements can be made. These nations re-sell their own property through a similar contractual system. Their citizens are also free to leave (or at least most of them) for better pastures, if they can find them. \n\n\n\n**All An-cappers want to do is hit a magical reset button to destroy government and let it reform under a different name.** Maybe they'll call it a homeowner's association. Maybe they'll call it a corporation. They want to hit the reset button, because this time around, maybe they can then grab a bigger piece for themselves. \n\n\nAn-Cappers might object to my criticism because the last time our world was formed, violence and aggression was \"legal\" and \"allowed\". Well, violence and aggression obviously will not magically disappear the second time around when they hit the reset button. Without a monopolizing, governing body to restrict or regulate violence, then nothing will be different the second time around. Bad corporations/businesses/governments will do bad things, and nobody will be there to stop it, just like since the dawn of human history. Everyone can even agree that bad things are bad or that aggression is bad, but they'll just go ahead and do it anyways when it just so happens to help themselves. All the social ostracism in the *world*, quite literally, hasn't made North Korea or Iran or any other dictator change their evil ways. It surely wouldn't work after the An-caps hit their reset button. \n_____\n\n\nThe Ancap utopia has no differences whatsoever to the world as it is today. As in our world, there is no governing authority that demands that everybody follow the Non-Aggression-Principle or that people respect each others rights. Without enforcement, everybody will just do whatever they want to. Bad people will do bad things if they can get away with it. Power will be conglomerated eventually into super-corporations that would eventually resemble the governments we see today. Just like our own world, after the big corporations have seized all the valuable property, they can then govern however the fuck they please. \"My House, My Rules. If you don't like it, then just get off of my property!\" Eventually, after the corporations have taken over, the next generation of anarcho capitalists will grumble about how evil their new corporate/government overlords are. They too want to hit that reset button again.\n\n\nThe only difference between the Ancap utopia and our own world is that, in the Ancap society, everyone nearly homogeneously believes in Ancap principles, asides from a few troublemakers. \n\n\nBut we already live in their world.

The strong will claim that public property and will be able to successfully defend it. Already, the strong of our world will have an advantage.

It shouldn't be too hard to conclude that nearly *all territory in the world* has probably been \"unjustly\" annexed by a larger power, depending on the point of view of the weak vs. the powerful. For example, that corporation that seized all the public transportation could rightfully claim that they \"homesteaded\" it.

In short Homesteading is woefully inadequate in deciding who gets what. The real world is simply too complicated. Out of the thousands of users of a particular highway, which of them has the bet \"claim\" of ownership? At the very beginning, with such ambiguity with who owns what, injustices will be done. The strong will claim that public property and will be able to successfully defend it. Already, the strong of our world will have an advantage. Already, your world will be \"unjust\" when a corporation successfully seizes public property and defends it using homesteading principles, successfully monopolizing the entire transportation system of your city. \n\n\nThe ancap world has horrifyingly difficulties in handling how property can be \"justly\" homesteaded. It shouldn't be too hard to conclude that nearly *all territory in the world* has probably been \"unjustly\" annexed by a larger power, depending on the point of view of the weak vs. the powerful.

So if that's what ancaps oppose and the alternative that they propose is a society where individuals choose their form of governance regardless of arbitrary geographical compartmentalization, how is that what we have today? \n\nI don't see multiple jurisdictions overlap in a single 'territory' (which can't really exist then - no borders and free movement), I don't see individuals choosing their form governance with its respective advantages and disadvantages - as opposed to it being imposed due to geographical proximity, etc. How is that like what we have now?

Human space exploration has little to do with science IMO. They're merely political statements equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest or putting a flag on the top of the North Pole, or putting a flag on the bottom of the North Pole's ocean (I'm looking at you, Russia). True scientific missions - robotic missions, accomplish science goals at 1/100th of the price of a human mission. Why put a man on Mars when we can send 100 robotic, scientific missions for the same price? \n\n\n2. Asteroid mining is a joke. If asteroid mining is so \"viable\", then commercial enterprise should be the one spearheading the endeavor, not government. Governments are not good at running profitable, viable businesses. Why waste government money subsidizing the asteroid mining industry? If the industry cannot prop itself up, it should not be funded.\n\n\n3. Your list is pretty short for something that was eating up more than 5% of our GDP. If you want to fund science and technology, then fund science and technology. No need to give funding to rebuilding more rockets. Moreover, Apollo has the benefit of helping R&amp;D because it was the first of its kind. How does re-hashing old ideas further science and technology? \n\nWorst of all, you've neglected to analyze *how efficient* space programs are at converting money into research and technology.

Sure you could be arguing that the bonds that you will refinance into the indefinite future represents spending not sent over to education, but NASA is 0.5% of the US Federal Budgets (and more than 35% of all science funding in the United States) by contrast the department of Education gets five times the resources. On the other end of the Spectrum Medicare and Medicaid represent 22% of the US Federal Government and Social Security another 24%. NASA gets crumbs. Science funding in general is an afterthought in the US Budget and Welfare programs get almost half of all the money.\n\nEven if they took NASA's budget for education, public schools wouldn't see any of it. Public Schools are funded by property taxes. Public Universities get money from the States. Federal Government doesn't pay for any education, but it does occasionally give grants for things.\n\nReally, the science we are doing to purify and collect water on Mars means learning new and better ways to purify and collect water on Earth. People don't starve because there isn't enough food, we are massively overproducing food, they are starving because people prevent them from gaining access to food. Most major famines are the result of war or government repression. Taking NASA's budget wouldn't help.\n\nOn a practical level, there is nowhere near enough science spending. New science improves quality of life across the board. New technology means new products, more efficient processes, and ways to use or manage pollution. Many of our problems come from the fact that we are doing too much of couple of processes. We do too much of those things because we don't have a choice. If we were to develop better choices then we would resolve a lot of the problems. The problem is that national governments spend almost nothing on research. Companies spend money on research, but only research they think will pay them back in the next few years. The average person doesn't have the giant pile of money to do scientific research. We can train all the scientific researchers we want, but without paying people to actually do research you'll have PHDs checking you out at Walmart.

Yet now, it is a hell of a lot better *because* that money was spent.\n\nConsider if you were back in the 1700's. A scientist asks you over to his house. You pass people starving in the street on the way to his house, and the whole city is a dump. When you get to his house, he shows you that if you rub together amber and fur, you can sometimes produce a magical little spark. He's looking for someone to give him a living stipend so that he can feed his family while experimenting with this spark. You know that he is well-educated. Think of the the objections you could have:\n\n* This spark is a parlor trick at best with no practical value.\n* Why would I fund your research when I can spend money on helping people now?\n* Your research won't make me any money!\n* If I wanted to fund research, I'd fund something more practical, like better blacksmithing techniques or a method to make a better plough.\n\nLittle did we know that this magical little spark was static electricity, and it was through the experiments of scientists over 100's of years that we came to discover something profoundly useful, something that changed humanity forever: electricity. The people who funded the scientists that did such research did humanity a great service and made our lives much better, even though they most certainly could have been spending it on \"better things\" back then too.\n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2od6s9", "body": "I've thought this for a long time, and the recent surge in media awareness has brought this idea to the forefront of my mind. \"Resisting arrest\" is currently a felony offense in multiple states (USA..) but anecdotally the charge is used to basically trump up the 'offenses' committed by the perp. For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \n\nNow I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \n\n---------\nEdit*\n\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested. If a cop grabs my arm and I pull away he may think in about to get aggressive and he'll tase me or tackle me or accidentally choke me to death for fear of his own safety\n\n\u2206 so the problem is deeper than policy, it's the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws, its the people and traditions.

Get back here.\"? \n\n&gt;I don't think that's something we want either, otherwise we've just given the same dangerous latitude to civilians that we currently give to the police when we allow them to exercise deadly force if they \"feel threatened.\"\n\n\u2206 I can't remember the policy on giving out delta's but you're points were very clear.

It's not an example that I would use to support my argument.  \n\nYou ask for examples of police brutality that nobody is doing anything about, but by it's nature, that's a very difficult thing to prove.  I can site personal experience, as I have elsewhere in the replies, but it wouldn't be an example of pervasive corruption.  I can cite cases where there is proof of corruption, but that would mean that someone was doing something about it, which again doesn't provide the evidence that you're looking for.  \n\nThe closest that I can come to giving examples of rampant corruption would be the [\"no niggers uptown\" rule in Highland Park](http://www.finalcall.com/national/2000/nypd4-4-2000a.htm), where Chief Daniel J. Dahlberg instructed his officers to arrest any blacks coming into the town and fabricate evidence to justify the arrest afterwards.  \n\nAnother example, again in the Chicagoland area, would be that of [Officer John Burge](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jon-burge-ex-chicago-cop-who-ran-torture-ring-released-prison) who tortured at least 100 people during his career, and was assisted in doing so by his fellow police officers.  \n\nThere was also the Abner Louima case, where after police raped him with a plunger with enough force to perforate his colon and bladder, then  shoved the bloody plunger into his mouth, breaking his teeeth, they went on to brag about it to the rest of the police force.  A nurse at the hospital he was treated at called the NYPD internal affairs bureau and reported the incident, but the cop who took the report failed to log the case.  \n\nThese are all cases that were later proven to be true, involving the collaboration of many police officers to cover their crimes.  Although several of them did later face justice, such as in Abner Louima's case, where the officer who raped him with the plunger still resides in prison, all the others in the station who witnessed either the attack, or participated in the cover up, were not charged or found not guilty in appeals.  \n\nMost of the cases I mentioned were from long ago, but the epidemic of police crime and cover up is ongoing.  Here's an example of a man who was nearly beaten to death for [not signing a ticket in 2011.](http://youtu.be/6lcYTJx9Y1c)  Note that the CHP Chief Ken Hill suggests that to prevent this sort of thing from happening that the victim in this case would have had nothing to fear had he complied with the order to sign the ticket before reading it.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animus_nocendi.  In order to prosecute a police officer for unlawful arrest, you need to prove intent, which is why I suggested that prosecution only be made in instances where intent or malice was present.  I think you're going to find it pretty hard to prove that a police officer had intent to commit an unlawful arrest.  If the prosecution can't prove intent, it's a waste of resources to attempt prosecution.  \n\n&gt;Why is it acceptable for officers to say \"oh, I didn't know filming was illegal\", repeatedly, and get away with unlawfully arresting people, even in your suggested system?\n\nAn officer who honestly believes that filming is illegal, and who makes an arrest in good faith, has perhaps committed a crime, but it was not intentional.  Additionally, there is a difference between detention and arrest.  Being unlawfully detained can happen, but the bar is EXTREMELY high for prosecution.  If an officer thinks that you might have been involved in the crime they are investigating, you can be lawfully detained until the officer determines whether you were involved.  Someone who is interfering with police can be detained temporarily to stop the interference without being arrested.  \n\nIt's not acceptable for a police officer to say \"Oh, I didn't know filming was legal\" repeatedly, and I sincerely doubt it has happened more than a handful of times.  Contrary to popular belief, police do not allow their colleagues to repeatedly commit crimes.  An officer who fails to appropriately enforce the same law repeatedly is going to be out of a job in all but the most rare of occasions.

For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \n\nNow I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \n\n---------\nEdit*\n\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested. If a cop grabs my arm and I pull away he may think in about to get aggressive and he'll tase me or tackle me or accidentally choke me to death for fear of his own safety\n\n\u2206 so the problem is deeper than policy, it's the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws, its the people and traditions. I'd still like to see more protection for civilians but \"allowing\" resisting arrest probably isnt the right avenue, a new generation of judges may be more lenient towards it but thats a different story.\n\n----\n\nEdit**\n\n&gt;Maybe in theory, but is that really a bluff you want to call when the police officer starts saying \"No, you can't walk away. Get back here.\"? \n\n&gt;I don't think that's something we want either, otherwise we've just given the same dangerous latitude to civilians that we currently give to the police when we allow them to exercise deadly force if they \"feel threatened.\"\n\n\u2206 I can't remember the policy on giving out delta's but you're points were very clear.

Sometimes the suspect's behavior can escalate further, to where they are aggressive as well, so you have to remember, cops have to keep this in the back of their mind, in pretty much every encounter they have.\n\nThe point of this is all that even if you are innocent, at the end of the day, if you cooperate with police, you're just going to have an easier time.  You might lose an afternoon of freedom and perhaps a day at work because you have a court hearing, but the fact of the matter is that at the end of the day, you can't argue or prove your innocence if you're mouth is wired shut because of a broken jaw or if you're dead.\n\nSo ultimately, it's in everyone's best interest to just cooperate, even if the cop is being a \"total dick\" and \"you've done nothing\" (regardless of how accurate those statements may be)."}, {"id": "cmm4oqq", "body": "&gt; in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nYou are not a judge or a jury, so you are not in a position to determine whether your arrest is legal or justified.

For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \n\nNow I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \n\n---------\nEdit*\n\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested. If a cop grabs my arm and I pull away he may think in about to get aggressive and he'll tase me or tackle me or accidentally choke me to death for fear of his own safety\n\n\u2206 so the problem is deeper than policy, it's the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws, its the people and traditions. I'd still like to see more protection for civilians but \"allowing\" resisting arrest probably isnt the right avenue, a new generation of judges may be more lenient towards it but thats a different story.\n\n----\n\nEdit**\n\n&gt;Maybe in theory, but is that really a bluff you want to call when the police officer starts saying \"No, you can't walk away. Get back here.\"? \n\n&gt;I don't think that's something we want either, otherwise we've just given the same dangerous latitude to civilians that we currently give to the police when we allow them to exercise deadly force if they \"feel threatened.\"\n\n\u2206 I can't remember the policy on giving out delta's but you're points were very clear. Especially when you circled back to: \"it's a problem with individual officers, not the system\" while I agree that the officer is obviously the main factor I think there is a systemically induced fear on both sides which is not addressed (and maybe even escalated) by allowing civilians to resist.\n\n----"}, {"id": "cmlzuda", "body": "&gt;For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch.\n\nNot exactly actually, and here's something that I think a lot of people need to understand... in any encounter with a law enforcement officer [has to be consensual unless you're being arrested](https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse-702.aspx).

What currently happens is cop kills someone who was innocent, they probably get some sort of punishment most the time like being laid off or even fired, persons family sues and the tax payer pays for what that cop did not the cop, so the cop gets out of what could be a major problem for them for the most part.

The only caveat I would add, and I fucking hate how every news story I read about police brutality has [victim name], *a black man*, was shot after [officer name], *a white officer*, is that I think certain people actually do get to live that life of 'do what the cops say and you'll be fine,' while others don't.\n\nThe guy getting probed/molested is kind of different and not, because I don't think police treatment is as simple as black people are mistreated by white cops. I think all kinds of minorities (the best example? people with mental health issues, but also poorer people, etc.) are treated worse by police than what you would accept as your regular every day citizen. So your general rule to be compliant makes sense and won't always save people, but there's some people that it really doesn't matter what they do, they're pegged by police as shitty and destined to be screwed over no matter what. I really encourage you to go through that list, it's a combination of bad luck and bad demographics.\n\nThe point of this thread and my talking really was just that you should be able to say no and explain yourself before you let people put cuffs on you. Garner literally just kind of shook off a few grabs before he was choked to death, and that's the shitty thing here. Just by not saying \"what seems to be the problem, officers\" for the umpteenth time in his life and submitting to whatever they felt like making him do that day, he was unwittingly ending his life. It shouldn't be that simple. You should be able to do more to voice your discontent with the system without risking being treated like shit and possibly attacked. But they didn't like him from the start, and this is where I get pissed with all the \"well, he committed a crime, he had it coming\" bullshit newscasters are spouting to defend these unnecessarily violent cops, when not all crime is equal.\n\nBut I let that get out of hand. Thanks a lot for disagreeing but being kinder about it. There's definitely more to discuss on this, but unfortunately these horrible incidents are just marking the start of what I hope is a larger conversation.
