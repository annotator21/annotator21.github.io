The most notable cases of the spoiler effect (at least in the US) have occurred when a major party politician breaks ranks when they lose their party's primary.

Even if the vote is not counting for the majority, it will be noted and has a certain impact. \n\nSo, I looked up how the croatian system works: The voters are devided in 12 groups, ten groups are equally distributed over the citizens, one group is for the \"diaspora\"( they vote for four seats) and the last group represents minorities  - they get a certain amount of representatives, each. Within each group, all parties that match the quorum get their seats. Croatia has 4.5 Mio inhabitants, each voting block is roughly 450.000 and the minium quorum is 5%, of the people who have actually voted. \n\nIt seems relatively easy to get into the parliament (compared to different political systems ). You need maybe 10.000 votes to meet the quorum (people over 18 + 50%, who actually vote.) If you had a couple of friends who think in the same way, you could actually talk with all possible voters in person. You wouldn't need funding for TV adds etc...\n\nYou dont need to start own campaign. But croatia seems to be a country in which a single vote actually matters. Have you considered to contact the parlamentarians in your region in person? Each of them is just representing a couple of thousand voters, and you might even get a personal answer. Try to contact a  younger (&lt;40) parliamentarian who lives close to you and has a similar background. Ask **him** to CyourV \n\nAlso consider voting for a party that will surely not meet the quorum. For instance in Germany we had the Pirate Party (Internet freedom, privacy, anti-surveillance) having 3%, and **all** parties took the topic more seriously in the next term. Things like national-wide porn blocker are off the table. They had been discussed before and are employed in other EU countries ( UK ).

There have been 150 exonerated death row inmates since 1973.  Who knows how many innocents were executed?\n\n&gt;your question is really more a philosophical problem with the death penalty itself, rather than its applicability in this case\n\nI agree that it's a problem with the death penalty itself.  However, it's certainly applicable here.  No one denies that capital punishment is irrevocable.  For some people, they're willing to take that risk for the most serious of crimes.  The argument is that, for some crimes, it's acceptable to risk murdering an innocent citizen because the crime committed was so heinous.  By advocating for the death here, penalty you're putting lying about being a victim on the same level as murder.\n\n&gt;I think a lying psychopath like Madoff who ruined thousands of people's lives should also face the ultimate punishment.\n\nSo stealing billions merits the death penalty.  What about thousands? Hundreds? What if I steal a hundred dollars from someone living paycheck to paycheck?  Can I be executed for that?  What about stealing a thousand dollars from a billionaire?  If being a \"lying psychopath\" is bad, is it better if I just break into someone's house and take their money instead?  If I don't want to be executed, can I just repay the person?  Is anyone who commits fraud deserving of capital punishment?\n\nUltimately, I'm curious as to why you think these people *should* receive the death penalty?

You need to put up good grades, be able to demonstrate a sincere interest to the most die hard nerds in that field, and get good recommendations from professors. What impresses professors? Competence, interest, and hard work. Professors are the ones who will recommend you for scholarships and jobs, and they have no use for phonies.\n\nEven if you stop at a bachelors; I don't know anyone who got their first job through their friends in college, and a very few got it through professors or faculty they had impressed. Most got it by sending out resumes and having high enough grades that it put them at the top of the pile. That's how they sort college resumes. Easiest way to get high grades is to invest yourself and try to understand the material. Only when you clear that hurdle will you go in for an interview or will they read your recommendations. \n\nThe \"network benefit\" to school really only comes in ten or more years out, when you and your classmates are senior enough to actually have weight in hiring and business decisions.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2p8w9e", "body": "Most people go to university to get a job.

But only because these things communicate some type of \"character.\" Someone can say they are not attracted to objectively beautiful woman who looks high mainenance due to her style and make up being a turn off for what they say about her. \n\n\nHowever, two points with these: a) these things are incredibly easy to change on one individual, all of these are acquired and not born with; b) making someone your type by purely matching these might add or subtract up to a point or two or make an already beautiful person additionally attract you more or less, but the whole foundation of whether they would be found beautiful or not is still relying on genetic beauty (for example seeing a grogeous unshaved woman would be shocking because of culture, but you would be able to perceive she is beautiful, and she'd still be more beautiful than an ugly shaved woman - just less appropriate)\n\n\n\nWhat makes beauty is facial and body symetry. \n\n\nAs an example, people may talk about prefering very skinny or curvy bodies (by curvy I mean curvy not fat - fat hides physical shape and is definitely ugly, and even older cultures that appreaciated fuller forms NEVER appreciated fat - in fact humans always perceive same waist to hip ratio as attractive regardless of the size.) But say you love very skinny. Trust me you would still find a fuller body attractive if it is very proportional - long legs in comparison to torso, right waist to hip ratio, narrower shoulders.. than you would a super skinny person with short legs, wide shoulders, lesser hip to waist raito. You don't like brunettes? As if you wouldn't be able to tell that a brunette with amazing facial symetry is hotter than a blonde (your type) with long chin or forehead too big.\n\n\nAnd these are things that can't just be changed to match a style and trend. Yes, everyone has their own maximum and people can improve their looks... only up to the point. Even with all of us looking our best we still rank 1-10. In the end a person can be in shape and your type based on style, but bad body and face proportions will set a clear limit to how beautiful they are. \n\n\nIts a simple fact and I don't know why people try to pretend it is relative.

I feel like this is kind of just playing word games over your definition of \"good\". Based on your definition of a \"good person\", you've basically defined a good person such that anyone who commits an atrocity is automatically disqualified from being a good person.

But I would say both statements are equally unsettling.\n\nSo to the degree that I find it worthwhile to change your view, I think your criteria for \"good person\" is FAR too strict. From your definition of a good person, parts #1 and #2 necessitate a certain level of education or intelligence.

While I feel ethical nihilism or error theory to be the most correct representation of the world I don't think it leads to meaningful or positive outcomes if \"embraced\". I really like the ideas of utilitarianism. I like how it can promote healthy society. I also support the existence of other frameworks that may wildly differ (relativism). But they're all just in people's heads: there is no right or wrong. I haven't yet figured out how to come to terms with those two things.

[Here](http://www.policeone.com/patrol-issues/articles/6199620-Why-one-cop-carries-145-rounds-of-ammo-on-the-job/) is an example of a police shootout in which the attacker was hit 14 times from a .45, with 6 hits in supposedly fatal locations, and kept fighting.

She's lucky he ran, because she emptied her revolver. I would rather a home invasion victim end the attack with 20 rounds leftover than die because they ran out of ammo.\n\n* Shotguns are [more likely to penetrate walls](http://www.theboxotruth.com/the-box-o-truth-14-rifles-shotguns-and-walls/) and injure innocent bystanders than an AR-15 (i.e. effective range at which it will cause injury is INCREASED in practical home defense scenarios, while the damage path is simultaneously less controllable). \n\n* Shotgun shots are also harder to keep on target since the pellets spread out.\n\n* Shotguns kick way too hard for my grandma, my handicapped friend, or to be honest, most of the women I know, to accurately get off more than one shot.

However, I think it's also very rare that you'd find yourself in a situation where you want to fire a bullet and not be able to fire several more in rapid succession. For instance, I might miss. Or I might hit my target but I still need to fire more. Or I might have multiple targets. Firing a bullet doesn't mean killing something. Might it? Sure, but in general if I'm trying to kill or incapacitate someone or something, I want as many chances as possible to do so.

If you're in danger to the point that a gun would be useful, you probably don't have time to wait for the police to arrive.  \n\nReally, the police usually only show up after the fact.

I've never heard of any competitive automatic weapon-shooting competitions. And why would you \"collect\" a weapon that you can buy at a store?\n\nFirst, you can hunt small game with small caliber rifles - varmint hunting in particular is a very popular use for these.  Your ignorance of this means that you aren't informed enough to have a informed conversation on the subject.\n\nSecond, 3 gun and centerfire rifle matches both regularly feature semiautomatic rifles, as do \"service weapon\" category of medium and highpower marksmanship matchs.   Here's a non-comprehensive list of shooting matches, many of which allow the use of semiautomatic rifles: http://compete.nra.org/nra-national-trophies.aspx\n\nThird, why do people collect anything, from beanie babies to pokemon or magic the gathering cards?  \n\nFourth, The AR-15 is nearly identical to the M-16 used by the military, the chief difference is the lack of fully automatic fire.  Millions of veterans used them for years during their service, so it is only natural that they'd want a rifle that operates nearly identically to what they carried.  On top of that, games like COD and others have introduced an entire new generation to the concept of recreational shooting - people want to own guns similar to what they've played with in a game, and learn that they enjoy shooting in real life too.  The AR-15 is the most popular selling rifle in the US, to the point that when President Obama tried to have the Assault Weapons Ban reenacted after Sandy Hook, there was such an explosion of demand that multiple factories had to move to 24/7 production and expand their manufacturing capability.  Some companies (IIRC Colt and SIG) dramatically reduced their pistol production in order to try to meet the surge in demand.  Ammunition supplies are only now beginning to catch up to the demand from that round of panic buying.\n\n&gt; Assault weapons have one purpose, they are meant to kill humans. Not only that, but they are intended to allow the user to kill a large number of humans in a short amount of time.

Can you think of any possible reason to fire 150 (or more) bullets in 5 minutes other than \"I want to kill a lot of peop\n\nWrong, as illustrated above.  Your ignorance of the subject matter is really clearly illustrated here.  Let's face it, \"killing people\" is one possible use for weapons, but given that there are 300 million+ firearms in the US, and less than 12,000 homicides by them yearly they clearly aren't used for that \"purpose\" - and as noted elsewhere, all rifles (including so called \"assault weapons\") don't even make up 5% of all firearms homicides yearly: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8\n\nAs for a possible reason, I'll give you a few:  The LA Riots where [Korean shopowners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzkBGQx3HAc) defended their businesses from rioters, and the recent riots in Ferguson where [several businesses](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/11/29/Black-Ferguson-Residents-Armed-With-AR-15s-Save-White-Owned-Business) were guarded by people armed with so called \"assault weapons\"  - including [one that had previously had its windows smashed out and received national media coverage](http://abcnews.go.com/US/oath-keepers-guard-fergusons-streets-rooftops-drawing-police/story?id=27303096) as a result including a [viral gofundme donation campaign](http://www.gofundme.com/NataliesCakesnMore)\n\nSo called \"assault weapons\" have a lot going for them.  They are light weight, accurate, easy to shoot, ergonomic and can be customized with a plethora of aftermarket accessories.  Many people in the firearms community call the AR-15 rifle the Barbie gun for just this very reason.   They are reliable, simple enough that [kids can use them to save their lives](http://gunssavelives.net/self-defense/video/son-uses-dads-ar-15-to-defend-home/), or [compete in championships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_fm6epAoN8) (note, that's an actual machinegun, not an \"assault weapon\") and are fun to shoot.\n\nIn summation, don't be so paranoid.  Gasoline is available for $3 a gallon without a single background check, as are matches.  For $20 you can make enough molotov cocktails to burn down a building.  Bleach and ammonia mixed together create chloramine which is a highly toxic gas, or for that matter chlorine by itself is an oxidant that can cause fires; again, available without background checks.
