Women have female only spaces, to claim that feminism is about equality but completely shut down anyone who comes in to talk about and ban men is just completely counter productive. If you want to educate people, you repeat yourself until your voice is hoarse and your fingers ache, because you don't teach anyone a thing by keeping to yourself. /r/TwoXChromosomes was a female safe space before it became a default, /r/TrollXChromosomes, /r/MakeupAddiction, /r/femalefashionadvice, /r/GirlGamers are all female safe spaces (There are loads others, those are just the ones I frequent a lot). Feminism as a whole needs to be open to the discussions, otherwise they just play into the trope that they're angry and unreasonable and can't listen. \n\nAnd I hate the \"What about men?\" anti-argument. There are loads of issues that affect both men AND women. Why are we only talking about half of the issue at hand while completely dismissing another vital piece of the puzzle? Rape happens in the military. Women AND men BOTH have to deal with it - and male rape is vastly under reported! Why are we completely isolating female rape from male rape and not addressing or even identifying the causes and situations that cause that abuse of power? \n\nWhy aren't we allowing men to talk about their issues with hypermasculinism which leads to the whole women being weak and wimpy and the female gender being used as an insult? \n\nNothing is getting done with the modern feminist because they're too easily annoyed at people looking to educate themselves and too quick to isolate themselves from other's experiences."}, {"id": "cmwmiu2", "body": "The defense I've heard here is that to bring down all inequality everywhere is just too big a job to take on all at once.

They don't have places for people to ask questions because they're too busy being exasperated that people are actually asking questions and challenging their theories - and if it's that much of a problem, why not as a community come together with a faq that discusses all of the major points? The people who fought against the vietnam war didn't complain about having to explain why they believed what they believed, even vegans, the most complained about subculture because of their food choices, will happily explain to you about their food choices and why they choose them. They even have trucks that go to school campuses where you can watch animals die for a dollar in order to bring awareness to their cause! What does feminism do that doesn't close it's doors against those who are unaware, misguided, or misinformed? It's laziness. You have something you believe in, then fucking fight for it until you've achieved it. It's not like feminism as a whole has not been apart or helped any other major activist movement in the past 200 and has completely forgot how to change people's hearts.\n\nThis isn't something that needs to be broken down. Military rape shouldn't be divided - to look at only female rapes says that it's all the menz doing it, to look at the men and female rape says that there's a higher culture of systematic abuses at work in the ranks. By breaking some bigger issues down into smaller pieces, we're losing half of the reasons and coming up with faulty solutions that don't cut it.\n\nFor example \"Let's teach men not to rape!\" Men are raping women, we need to teach all of them that raping is wrong. But, common sense already says that is true - normal people know that rape is wrong! By going after the ENTIRE male population as a solution, we're ignoring the fact that male on male rape, and female on male rape is happening as well. You know what a better solution would be? \n\n1. Educate everyone what rape and sexual assault is.\n\n2. Educate everyone on physical and emotional abuse, recognizing the signs that you're putting yourself in a bad situation. Walking down a dark alley isn't the most predominant way to be raped, walking to your car with someone you just met within a day or two is one of the most predominant ways to be raped. \n\n3. Identify how people establish and use power in order to use others for sexual gain. Then, create methods in which one can diffuse that power and walk away.\n\n4. Create avenues that both sexes can use in order to find safe places to go after they have been abused.\n\nDo you see how easily I just took out the \"women only\" rhetoric?

It's so obvious that people of all kinds face hardships linked to their identity that the fact this is even considered a counterargument is, frankly, absurd. The idea that there is a race or gender that doesn't experience *any* discrimination is a strawman - it conflates two ways of understanding discrimination, [as this thread covers surprisngly well](https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/2p82f8/the_irony_of_new_atheists_hiding_their/):\n\n&gt;Like, I wouldn't mind people saying \"It's racist to be mean to someone based on their skin color\" so long as we can also acknowledge that it's way worse to systematically oppress a group of people through power structures, etc. The real problem is that people pretend that the second kind of racism doesn't even exist, and the neocons then pussyfoot their less significant definition of racism as the key injustice.\n\nIn other words, you can be racist to a white person, but *every* black person experiences *systemic racism* in a way that white people don't. Same goes with men and women - you can discriminate against the men, but women experience *systemic sexism* in a way that men don't. Furthermore, discrimination against men isn't a disproof of the feminist analysis.\n&gt;For any changes to truly happen they have to be embraced by EVERYONE\n\n&gt;If feminists want to preach to the choir, and only talk to other people that share similar views, they will lack the power to make their \"woman's issue\" into a HUMAN issue.\n\n&gt;In order to make that leap, they need to allow people with questions, and opinions that are different to make their claim, and show why their answer is the best, out of all available answers.\n\nAnd fortunately, we can observe that race equality made its largest strides through movements *led by people-of-color leaders and as movements for people of color.* So I don't find your hand-wringing about \"human issues\" very convincing.\n\nBy the way, there are *plenty* of places you can go to meet feminists with your questions, and where they will argue that women's issues are human issues.

And just because they do exist doesn't make feminism close-minded, there are many places where feminism can be argued, it's just that some of them require that you know a little about it first and have maybe read some contemporary feminist literature as opposed to tumblr comments, so we don't have to explain introductory points over and over."}, {"id": "cmwi962", "body": "What most guys don't understand about feminist spaces is that they don't really exist to cater to them, which is no bad thing and nothing you can fault them for.

Now, I know what you're thinking- they downvoted you for besmirching feminism!  No.  The incredulity was that I said female privilege was a thing and when I answered the \"totally respectful feminist\" who \"politely\" asked for examples I pointed to the legal system and how women serve 40% the sentence men serve for the same crimes and make up something like 3% or 4% of the prison population.\n\n* First Counterargument:  This is actually oppression because women are seen as fragile children who can't do time or couldn't hurt someone so badly.  \n\nNo.  This isn't oppression.  Yes, it's sexism.  But it's women benefiting from sexism, which is what I understand as the definition of privilege (An unfair advantage rooted in some bigotry or other, eg White Privilege) \n\n* Second Counterargument:  Men commit more crime, so they're a larger portion of the prison population.\n\nWell this is pretty obviously bigotry, so I'm just going to say \"It's the same racist argument racists make, but they swap out \"men\" for \"the blacks\"\" and move right along.\n\n* It's not privilege, it's \"benevolent sexism\".\n\nNo.  This is a double standard that does a backflip over facts and turns \"women get an unfair advantage here\" into \"women get an unfair advantage here **but** they're still the victim\".\n\nThis is on the order of calling sexism against men \"reverse sexism\".

So to the extent that \"criminal\" is a proxy for \"bad person,\" I have trouble with it. I don't think criminal really means anything more than \"unpopular.\" If measuring unpopular behavior is really our goal, I guess that's fine, but that doesn't seem to me to be what people are usually saying when they claim that men are more likely to be criminal. I think society should default to accommodating normal human behavior -- popular or not, not the other way around. As you pointed out, sometimes society does well at that, but often it doesn't, and using the word \"criminal\" as a pejorative to basically argue that a particular group of people should have less rights is making a circular argument, because the lack of rights is the only reason something is criminal in the first place. Of course I agree that things like murder, theft, assault should be crimes, I just disagree with the term \"criminal\" being any more useful than losing a popularity contest.\n\n&gt; drug laws - aren't really sexist\n\nI disagree with that. They're certainly and demonstrably racist in origin, and some of that racist origin is also blatantly sexist. The provocative imagery of black (or hispanic, or asian) men seducing white women with marijuana and opium cannot be separated from the birth of anti-drug policy in the U.S. Without such imagery, it is doubtful that those laws would ever have become so draconian or pervasive. The fact that these laws are enforced in such a way that, to this day, black and hispanic men are massively overrepresented in arrest and conviction stats, while using drugs no more often than the general public, suggests to me that these laws are, and always have been, at least partly intended to have a racist/sexist effect."}, {"id": "cmwr5zs", "body": "&gt; as long as men commit more crime, they'll be imprisoned at a higher rate (and there's nothing wrong with that)\n\nThere's only nothing wrong with that if the law is perfect.

Maybe men are (slightly) more dangerous, resulting in more laws that target men, more men then being arrested, and then men being seen as more dangerous, etc. Like much of sociology, the problem is the difficulty of getting good data to point to the actual cause.\n\nI feel that since we can't be sure, we should make an effort to be more fair. Ending the war on drugs is my usual go-to in his type of discussion, because it's really just criminalizing victimless risk-taking, and that certainly does target men -- unnecessarily, IMO.

Men are seen as strong, non-emotional, aggressive and suited to jobs in business, sport, manual labour. They are seen as physically and emotionally strong.\n\nNow, the patriarchy is not a systemic tool of oppression, consciously enforced by men, but rather the expression of these gender roles. They can manifest in a ridiculous assortment of ways. E.g.\n\n* Women in positions of power being derided as 'masculine' (because positions of power are traditionally masculine).\n\n* Women who are raped being told they are just being 'emotional' and should be more 'rational', or that she shouldn't have worn particular clothes (because women are seen as more emotional and irrational and not in a position to know whether they have been raped or not.\n\n* Men who choose to act as stay at home parents being branded as feminine, or being asked where the mother is (because being the breadwinner is traditionally a man's job).\n\n* Women who are convicted of a crime getting lower prison sentences (because they are seen as weak, and unable to withstand imprisonment as much as men. There's a lot of critical feminist literature about this).\n\n* Men being conscripted into the military (because men are seen as physically stronger).\n\n* Women being turned down for jobs in manual labour or technical jobs, or bieng impliedly told that those jobs are for men (either because they are seen as physically weak or 'irrational').\n\nThis is what most feminists will agree on. The rest is just divergent views, and I hope you understand why it is ridiculous to attack 'feminist' views based on assumptions of what those views are.\n\nIt would also be nice to not be told 'well that's not most feminists', because as a man who engages heavily in feminist discussion, I have never ever met a woman who actually thinks the things you seem to think feminists think.

Women got the vote at a later age than men when they did. The fact is, a lot of things still aren't equal between men and women - we still bring up boys and girls differently, women still have abortion restrictions (pregnancy is a very damaging condition, and men don't have any equivalent danger that's tied to 'morality') - whilst nothing's as blatant as before, there are still a lot of obstacles in the way of women becoming powerful - and obviously obstacles in the way of men becoming nurturers. I don't deny that people can claim feminism for bad things, but the thing is I think there are more anti-feminists than bad feminists. I think that men's rights groups should join with feminist groups, and listen to each other - not necessarily lose the 'MRA' title, but the attitude should be one of cooperation, not trying to shout each other out.

This is why most men are naturally more aggressive than women. Of course, the majority of men control their aggression, either shut it down or channel it through other, healthier and safer means - like sports.\n\nThis is what would explain why men commit more crimes than women.

It can be just that poor people tend to do more crime and that they are more poor blacks than white. So you really can make statistic say something other that what they represent. They are lot of factors which influence statistics and you can't reduce them to only one thing.)"}, {"id": "cmwalev", "body": "That's a strawman.

I will never forget an article I read about a woman in the Middle East who had her nose cut off by her husband to spite her. It's truly horrendous.\n\nIn Western countries such as the USA there are still issues like the prevalence of rape and sexism. 1 in 6 women are sexually assaulted. Women are often discouraged from being smarter than boys in math and science. Women are discouraged from being physically strong or having body hair. Yes, a woman may accuse a man of rape but false rape allegations are nowhere near as common as unreported rapes or prosecuted rapes. Talk to some women in your life, I'm sure some of them will acknowledge their fear of being attacked while walking to their car at night or going for walks a lone. It weighs on a lot of women's minds.\n\nLastly, being a woman or feminine is often seen as a downfall. What are some common insults? \"Don't be such a pussy\" \"You throw like a girl\" Etc. There are tons of complaints against gay men that are feminine. Any kind of femininity is seen as a weakness. Boys are told not to cry, not to like the color pink, not to wear skirts, not to like make up, etc.\n\nIf you want data on this stuff I have it. \n\nHere's a link to the stoning article\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/25/us-afghanistan-rights-idUSBRE9AO0EB20131125\n\nRape:\nhttps://www.rainn.org/statistics\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf"}, {"id": "cmwfh8l", "body": "Sure.

I don't think any of those things are female privilege.\n\n&gt;3% of people receiving alimony are men.\n\nThe link you provides says that men have to be talked into asking for alimony, that more women are paying alimony as time passes, and that 400,000 people are receiving spousal support - that's .3% of the female adult population.  Even the man who felt like he was discriminated against in his divorce hearing recieves $5,000 a month from his wife.  My family of three lives on less than that each month, and we're not pinching pennies.  I'm having a hard time seeing how this is privilege.\n\n&gt;96% of workplace deaths are men.\n\nIs that because when an employer hires a woman they gives her more safety equipment than a man, or do the employers that have poor workplace safety records also tend not to hire women?  If it's the first - okay, you may have a point.  If it's the second, then how is it female privilege?  Where do you think women go when they are laughed out of mines, construction sites, or farms?  They probably either stay at home with kids they can't afford to put into daycare, or they work in fast food or another low pay, low job security service field.  That hardly seems like privilege to me.  \n\nWorkplace safety isn't a man's issue, it's a workers' issue.  We should be trying to make all forms of work safer, regardless of who is doing the work.  And that is what is happening.  Both [non fatal](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/osh_12042014.htm) and [fatal](https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html) workplace incidents are very low (3.3% of workers suffered a non-fatal injury in 2013) and falling.  \n\n&gt;Three quarters of suicides are men.  \n\nWe should have better mental health care in general in this country.  [The ACA expanded mental health care services](http://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/health-insurance/) to help address this.  It's very unfortunate that anyone would chose to take their own life, but men being more likely to succeed in that attempt is no more female privilege than being unlikely to have Sickle Cell Anemia is white privilege.\n\n&gt;77% of murder victims are men.\n\nHow is this female privilege?  Murder is horrible, obviously, but a tiny, tiny percentage of people are murdered each year.  Unless you live in an extremely crime-ridden area, I doubt worry about being murdered is weighing heavily on your mind.  The issue here isn't some systematic prejudice against men that is causing them to be killed, it's the issues (probably poverty) that are causing people to commit murder.  [FBI statistics on murder, in case it's interesting](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expanded-homicide-data).  [US Census data for comparison](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html).\n\n&gt;Men are 30% more likely to be the victims of violent crime than women.\n\nAgain, how is this female privilege?  If I'm walking in a bad part of town, I'm not thinking \"Oh, well, I'm a woman, so there isn't much chance that I'll get mugged.\"  This is like saying \"White people are more likely to be in a fatal car crash than any other race, and this is an example of brown privilege\".\n\n&gt;More men are raped than women, and until two years ago it was literally impossible for a woman to rape a man.\n\nI'm assuming this includes [prison rapes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2449454/More-men-raped-US-women-including-prison-sexual-abuse.html).  Rape in prison is a horrible thing.  We don't allow rape as a proscribed punishment for crimes, so we shouldn't passively allow it in prison.  I'm not sure how to solve this problem, other than isolate inmates who are suspected to be likely to commit rape, but I don't think this is necessarily part of this conversation.   \n\nThis is another issue where I don't understand how this is an example of female privilege.  The vast majority of people aren't rapists.  I'm not \"privileged\" by being able to rape someone and have them not be believed.  That's like saying I could beat my dog to death and get away with it - the fuck kind of horrible person wants to do that in the first place?  Male rape victims should definitely be treated kindly and believed when they say they were raped.  Rape should definitely include \"being forced to penetrate\".  The fact that those things aren't or weren't the case is horrible - but it's not female privilege. \n\n&gt;Woman claims she was raped and you are a savage monster if you don't take her word as gospel. Boy was factually raped by a teacher and he was one lucky SOB, right?\n\nAs other posters have pointed out, women are often not believed or are blamed themselves when they say they were raped.  Anyone, regardless of gender, should be treated well when they report a rape.  But it's not female privilege that male victims are disbelieved or dismissed for different reasons than female victims are disbelieved or dismissed.  \n\n&gt;Breast cancer doesn't need more awareness. Were all already as aware as we're going to get. Prostate cancer kills about as many men as breast cancer kills women- where's the tens of billions a year in donations for him?\n\nHow is this female privilege?  If I get a disease, I might live because there has been research into the disease?  These billions of dollars in donations didn't spring up out of nowhere - people created organizations to ask for donations.  Is it \"child privilege\" that people donate to Saint Jude?  Is it \"animal privilege\" that people donate to the ASPCA?  Saying \"people donate to this\" isn't an example of privilege, in my mind.  \n\n&gt;society doesn't give a shit about his problems\n\nWhere do you get that idea?  The VA hospital scandal effects mostly men, and people cared about that.  People care about the death of Michael Brown, a man.  People hear about shootings committed by men and start calling for better mental health treatment.  I think the issue may be that society things about problems that effect women as \"women's problems\" and problems that effect men as \"problems\".\n\n\nOkay, now compare all of this to white privilege (which I'm guessing we share).  I experience white privilege when I walk through a city with a \"stop and frisk\" law, and don't even worry about being effected by it.  I experience white privilege when I sneak a waterbottle through security in the airport without worrying about someone assuming I'm in ISIS.  I experience white privilege when I interact with a mostly white police force and receive more polite, less suspicious treatment than I would if I was of another race.  Privilege is something you are just given by existing in a society that privileges people with your skin type/ class/ gender/ religion.  It's not something that you take by getting a lesser sentence on a crime, or by getting a donation for something that may or may not ever effect you.  Just saying \"things aren't 100% great for men and 100% awful for women\" isn't proving \"female privilege exists\".\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cmxjzvh", "body": "Since you've said that you don't think anyone is challenging your actual view, I'll take a crack at it.  I don't think any of those things are female privilege.\n\n&gt;3% of people receiving alimony are men.\n\nThe link you provides says that men have to be talked into asking for alimony, that more women are paying alimony as time passes, and that 400,000 people are receiving spousal support - that's .3% of the female adult population.  Even the man who felt like he was discriminated against in his divorce hearing recieves $5,000 a month from his wife.  My family of three lives on less than that each month, and we're not pinching pennies.  I'm having a hard time seeing how this is privilege.\n\n&gt;96% of workplace deaths are men.\n\nIs that because when an employer hires a woman they gives her more safety equipment than a man, or do the employers that have poor workplace safety records also tend not to hire women?  If it's the first - okay, you may have a point.  If it's the second, then how is it female privilege?  Where do you think women go when they are laughed out of mines, construction sites, or farms?  They probably either stay at home with kids they can't afford to put into daycare, or they work in fast food or another low pay, low job security service field.  That hardly seems like privilege to me.  \n\nWorkplace safety isn't a man's issue, it's a workers' issue.  We should be trying to make all forms of work safer, regardless of who is doing the work.  And that is what is happening.  Both [non fatal](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/osh_12042014.htm) and [fatal](https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html) workplace incidents are very low (3.3% of workers suffered a non-fatal injury in 2013) and falling.  \n\n&gt;Three quarters of suicides are men.  \n\nWe should have better mental health care in general in this country.  [The ACA expanded mental health care services](http://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/health-insurance/) to help address this.  It's very unfortunate that anyone would chose to take their own life, but men being more likely to succeed in that attempt is no more female privilege than being unlikely to have Sickle Cell Anemia is white privilege.\n\n&gt;77% of murder victims are men.\n\nHow is this female privilege?  Murder is horrible, obviously, but a tiny, tiny percentage of people are murdered each year.  Unless you live in an extremely crime-ridden area, I doubt worry about being murdered is weighing heavily on your mind.  The issue here isn't some systematic prejudice against men that is causing them to be killed, it's the issues (probably poverty) that are causing people to commit murder.
