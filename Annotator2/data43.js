In some cases its as simple as a woman getting married and forgetting to update her drivers license with the new name (this actually just happened to my sister). In other cases people don't need a driver's license because they don't have a car. So we're going to block many, many people from voting in order to prevent few if any from improperly voting?

She will defend their talent and originality to the end of the earth.\n\nThis was in response to me expressing my opinion that pop music as a whole is not all the same and unoriginal, but certain groups certainly are. Taylor Swift is one. I don't particularly enjoy her songs, and have only just felt that she writes unique music in light of Blank Space. Even so, it's catchy, but not necessarily original with pretty superficial lyrics. One Direction I feel is not at all original! All they've ever written are simple chord songs, again, with very superficial lyrics. I'm sure there are more artists out there that I can point to (Demi Lovato? Selena Gomez? Maroon 5? I dunno, I don't actively listen for them).\n\nTo summarize, I think the characteristics I think make these groups unoriginal are the type of fans they attract (if your music isn't meaningful, it's not going to attract people who look for meaning and quality!), simple song structure, superficial lyrics, and an overall effort to be catchy and popular. CMV!\n\nThis is important to me because I want to be able to write complex, beautiful arrangements with a wide variety of genres (I want to be the musical director of our fusion a Capella group - we do mashups of Indian and Western music). Also because she plays a big part in our group, but I feel like her tastes are incredibly limited. She'd never listen to alt-J or Metric or Lorde even though they are also considered pop and imo make much better music.\n\nA bigger part of me thinks this conflict is silly and people like whatever music they like, but I really would like to understand things from her pov.\n\n**Edit**: Okay I have three finals coming up and I need to study, so I want to update with my new[er] pov. Thank you for all of you who replied. This truly is very important for me to understand since I'm going to have to arrange music that a group of 14 or so people will all enjoy singing, and that a decent portion of a whole campus full of people with diverse tastes will enjoy. What people enjoy includes music that I don't, and I want to do all music that we perform justice.\n\nFirst and foremost, what constitutes originality is subjective to a point, and is also genre specific. My definition of it was harmonic complexity, rhythmic complexity, lyrics (maybe superficial lyrics with subliminal messages), and diversity of different sounds that an artist implements, since that's the genre of the artists in question.\n\nThat being said, originality does not correlate with quality, and the fact that the songs are good, even excellent to a lot of different people. The artists are not devoid of musical talent, and they certainly are famous to an extent, but then again, there are a lot of artists who are talented who are not famous. I still hold the opinion that I should be able to evaluate their music for my own personal tastes, and should be able to dislike characteristics that I think are superficial. I have never extended that sentiment to say that my tastes are therefore better. They simply are.\n\nLastly, that's exactly it, that peoples' tastes are what they are, and that they have every right to value the music in whichever way they please, and collective values lead to popularity. I'll take this into account when I'm listening to music that someone has suggested and try my best to evaluate the music itself, not the lyrics or the fans or the stigma associated with the artists, but I won't agree to do a song that I genuinely think is bad, even in the context of a mash-up. I trust those in my group to pick good songs. They get the benefit of the doubt."}, {"id": "cmnbzir", "body": "As a person who loves both mainstream pop and some pretty inaccessible shit (black metal, free jazz, 12-tone classical, etc.), let me try to defend pop music a bit here. \n\nThe first thing that we both need to acknowledge is that pop music is a different ballgame. Some people wonder why pop music doesn't use a wider range of harmonic structures, time signatures, lyrical topics, or whatever.

I don't care what anyone tells you, Oops I Did It Again was huge and she was everywhere and everyone hated it. *Side note: Artists like Katy Perry have contracts with Clear Channel to promote her music on their radio stations. Meaning, her music will be played regardless of whether people like it or not. To me, that is manufactured. Britney Spears actually declined their offer which lead her to be blacklisted from all major stations. So if you heard her songs on the radio, it wad due to public demand. I didn't find this out until about 3 years ago.*\n\nBut anyways, by 2008, it was general knowledge that Britney Spears got a lot of flack. Even before any of her drama, she was always being picked apart. Too sexual, too manufactured, lack of singing ability, bad role model, too fat, etc. So she was just not someone I was checking for. The moment she shaved her head was the moment I began to notice her. Not to watch the downfall but because I was sincerely curious as to what was going on. I was going through drug problems at the time and was doing reckless things and friends were constantly criticizing me, so I could realte. I followed her drama closely, forgetting about her music altogether. Then I'm 2008 my cousin came to me ranting and raving about her new album Blackout. So I got high and took a listen. Let me tell you, I was hooked immediately. It was nothing like what was on the radio. It was straight up dance music done with electronic production, catchy pop melodies, and breathy RnB vocals that utilized vocal processing and very little AutoTune. It was cohesive all the way through, it had a signature Britney sound, and it influenced all pop music that followed. Yet all you heard was people talking about her personal life and that if it was a good album it was because of the producers who saved her. Even Britney herself did zero promotion. It made the album that much more intriguing to me and I began to investigate. Even though she only had one writing credit, every song was undeniably Britney. I learned that It was her first album in which she was Executive Producer, meaning she had the final say in which songs made the final cut. She challenged her producers by giving them complete creative freedom. She turned down tracks from Timbaland, Lil Jon, and Dr. Luke, to name a few. Finally, Danja presented her with 11 tracks, 5 of which made the cut and shaped the sound. Her long time collaborators, The Neptunes and Bloodshy and Avant, knew her on a more personal level and we're able to make tracks that fit the sound she was after.\n\n\nWriters and producers have always created songs and put them out there in hopes that some artist would by it. Some songs go through multiple artists before one pays more than the rest. Nelly Furtado recorded over 100 tracks for her album Loose. All the songs on Blackout were created specifically for Britney Spears. Her impact was so great that The Dream wrote \"Umbrella\" for no one else but her. When she turned it down Jay-Z paid a million dollars for it to give to  Rihanna. My point is that, while some artists write their own songs and brag about it (Beyonce is notorious for changing one word on a pre written song and taking credit) they still end up sounding manufactured and unoriginal; others like TSwift do in fact write their own original music, but they pair it with whatever sound is current. Britney wanted to invigorate the sound of pop and her presence behind the scenes directly influenced each track (making them original) and placed importance on not sounding like the current Top 40 (making them not manufactured for the mass public). People have different standards for the music they like. Personally I appreciate it when an artist has input and dislike artists who target the younger audience in order to secure success."}, {"id": "2oh10f", "body": "I got into an argument with a friend who unabashedly loves and defends Taylor Swift and One Direction as being talented artists who do indeed produce original, unmanufactured music with (in her words) cool harmonies and bridge shenanigans (probably means more complex song progressions with more layers).

A lot of the metal I listened to focused on feelings of anger and frustration, and I don't really feel that way much anymore, so I've stopped listening. That said, there's still a concept in my mind of what would be \"good\" metal versus \"bad\", informed mostly by what I've come to see as the most common characteristics of the genre, but ultimately I'm going to say \"this is bad metal\" if it doesn't fit into my conception of what metal is supposed to express. That conception differs wildly from one of my friends, who is mostly obsessed with speed picking and throaty growls, even if the subject matter doesn't seem to fit very well - he values the qualities of the sound/skill of the players, I value the qualities of what it conveys emotionally.  He absolutely hates some of what I like for that reason, and I'm not too fond of some of what he likes in the same way.  We've tried expanding each other's horizons, but pretty much found ourselves at the same impasse, so we just agree to disagree at that point.

She will defend their talent and originality to the end of the earth.\n\nThis was in response to me expressing my opinion that pop music as a whole is not all the same and unoriginal, but certain groups certainly are. Taylor Swift is one. I don't particularly enjoy her songs, and have only just felt that she writes unique music in light of Blank Space. Even so, it's catchy, but not necessarily original with pretty superficial lyrics. One Direction I feel is not at all original! All they've ever written are simple chord songs, again, with very superficial lyrics. I'm sure there are more artists out there that I can point to (Demi Lovato? Selena Gomez? Maroon 5? I dunno, I don't actively listen for them).\n\nTo summarize, I think the characteristics I think make these groups unoriginal are the type of fans they attract (if your music isn't meaningful, it's not going to attract people who look for meaning and quality!), simple song structure, superficial lyrics, and an overall effort to be catchy and popular. CMV!\n\nThis is important to me because I want to be able to write complex, beautiful arrangements with a wide variety of genres (I want to be the musical director of our fusion a Capella group - we do mashups of Indian and Western music). Also because she plays a big part in our group, but I feel like her tastes are incredibly limited. She'd never listen to alt-J or Metric or Lorde even though they are also considered pop and imo make much better music.\n\nA bigger part of me thinks this conflict is silly and people like whatever music they like, but I really would like to understand things from her pov.\n\n**Edit**: Okay I have three finals coming up and I need to study, so I want to update with my new[er] pov. Thank you for all of you who replied. This truly is very important for me to understand since I'm going to have to arrange music that a group of 14 or so people will all enjoy singing, and that a decent portion of a whole campus full of people with diverse tastes will enjoy. What people enjoy includes music that I don't, and I want to do all music that we perform justice.\n\nFirst and foremost, what constitutes originality is subjective to a point, and is also genre specific. My definition of it was harmonic complexity, rhythmic complexity, lyrics (maybe superficial lyrics with subliminal messages), and diversity of different sounds that an artist implements, since that's the genre of the artists in question.\n\nThat being said, originality does not correlate with quality, and the fact that the songs are good, even excellent to a lot of different people. The artists are not devoid of musical talent, and they certainly are famous to an extent, but then again, there are a lot of artists who are talented who are not famous. I still hold the opinion that I should be able to evaluate their music for my own personal tastes, and should be able to dislike characteristics that I think are superficial. I have never extended that sentiment to say that my tastes are therefore better. They simply are.\n\nLastly, that's exactly it, that peoples' tastes are what they are, and that they have every right to value the music in whichever way they please, and collective values lead to popularity. I'll take this into account when I'm listening to music that someone has suggested and try my best to evaluate the music itself, not the lyrics or the fans or the stigma associated with the artists, but I won't agree to do a song that I genuinely think is bad, even in the context of a mash-up.

You can't post here then complain that people try to change your view.\n\nI apologize for wording it that way. I'm not complaining about you guys, it was more the bitterness at my friend who was legitimately pissed at me for disliking the music. Which shouldn't matter, so I'll move on.\n\nYou assume that I haven't listened to her albums. You're right, I haven't actively listened to anything but her top 10 or so. I also haven't been able to hear anything that was released in 1989 because why would I go out and buy someone's work that I don't enjoy on a regular basis? It's not on Spotify so I can't access it there. I have, however, listened to my friends play many of her songs (several of them pre-ordered 1989, so I've heard stuff from there too), talk about them extensively and so on. I'm basing my opinions off of that. I have definitely made an effort to evaluate her music because currently we are indeed doing a mash-up of Blank Space, which going to be amazing. Even so, I see no reason why I'm not allowed to evaluate her on her top songs and singles as well as her lesser known songs, most of which, by the way, are similar in content and style.\n\nThat being said, I don't think that innovations that are not harmonic or lyrical in nature don't count. She can innovate using any aspect of music she wants. They all count. You're right. But that doesn't change the fact that she hasn't, and given her genre, probably won't. I don't see her experimenting with heavy beats and synthetics sounds like they do in electronic music, nor do I see her experimenting with the examples you brought up in metal music. That's all. I wasn't limiting her to a narrow field, I was just speculating which would be the most likely areas she would experiment in.\n\nAnd she as a musician has! And I never, at any point, said she wasn't musically capable! She absolutely is! But she is still someone who strives to make popular music that teens will love and girls will relate to, and I think the content is only just starting to become more meaningful. And I was asking if that makes it unoriginal, if it takes away from the quality of meaningfulness of music. What I have gotten from this thread is that it doesn't take away from the musical talent she has, but when you take tastes into account, some people will value that, and some people will dislike it. \n\nI'm not about to judge her musical skill based on her content, but I will stick with the opinion that I think her music is unoriginal in some ways because of it, as well as admit that a lot of the music I like is unoriginal too. \n\nAlso, you seem to defend her quite vehemently as well, to the point that you assumed I knew nothing about her. I don't know as much as you, but the opinions I have come from what I believe is a valid set of experiences, and based off of what I value in music, and yours come from your own values.\n\nEdit: wording."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2ogti2", "body": "First I want to say this is not to offend anyone.

Do you even know what the word instinct means? It sure seems like you don't, if you think that sagging pants and holding guns sideways qualifies.\n\nI don't think you know what instinct is. The instinct is simply e.g. \"Survive at all costs\". It's not taught, it's inherent to all animals. A cat in the wild will hunt. In the city, it'll scavenge. In a home, it'll be lazy and picky about the food it gets served on a plate. All manifestations of the survival instinct, just dependent on the environment. Kind of like going to Yale and selling meth are essentially means to the same end - survival - dependent on the environment of the person. Obviously it's gained by observing and imitating, but I will insist that children primarily internalize the fear from their surroundings, and secondarily the hate, which develops as a rationalization partly by itself, stemming from that fear.\n\n&gt; Guess what? That is viewing others to be lesser people than you because of a physical characteristic, the definition of racism and prejudice.\n\nThey are not viewed as lesser people. They're viewed as not-people, as animals. Kind of like you look at apes, even though we share the vast majority of the DNA. Do you hate apes? No. Do you give them the same rights as people? No. Does that make you speciist, is it discrimination? Literally, yes. But in the sense of modern day racism? I wouldn't say so. Or, to bring it closer to home, not giving kids the right to vote isn't viewed as discrimination, because they're not believed to have the mental capacity for it, not because we're being ageist. On the other hand, e.g. not giving Mexicans the vote because \"them wetbacks will outbreed us, take our jobs and push us out of 'murica,\" that's racism, because the the negative emotional component that goes with it. For races, the former would be an example of ignorance and the latter of racism. There's a difference in that the first can be \"cured\" much more easily than the second.\n\n&gt; You do not know that, nor do I know that we will.\n\nRight now, even if we detonate all the nukes on the planet, some life will survive and adapt. We literally cannot blow up the planet (yet), barely scratch its surface.\n\n&gt; Are you really trying to say that we're as stupid as monkeys to try and shift blame away from ourselves? That mindset is exactly why our Earth is crying, but most people are so out of touch that they don't recognize the signs of the destruction we are causing. The truth does not change based on how palatable you find it to be.\n\nIf you can't understand the difference between explaining something and excusing it/shifting blame, that's your problem. Our actions are due to our instincts, like it or not. That doesn't mean we're not responsible for them, nor that we're as stupid as monkeys, a statement which would make YOU speciist, because monkeys aren't stupid. You can't judge another species by our standards. The average monkey would survive much better in its habitat without tools than you, making you the stupid one.\n\nAnd, oh, the Earth isn't crying, don't dramatize. It's a planet. Otherwise I can say that the Sun is so psyched with what we're doing that it's literally exploding with joy.\n\n&gt; The instinct of having sex is FOR having kids, to reproduce.\n\nTo understand cause and effects at such a complex level, you need a human brain. Anything you specifically need a human brain for isn't instinct anymore. Having sex is the instinct. Having kids is the explanation for why that instinct exists. Kind of like eating is an instinct, and not dying of starvation is the explanation.\n\n&gt; GMO's are tinkering with genetics, not breeding.\n\nUnless you don't believe in evolution, selective breeding, and evolution by definition is also tinkering with genetics, just much, MUCH slower. After all, our early ancestors lived in water, and now we're here, a feat no human genetic engineering will be able to replicate for quite a while.\n\n&gt; You are literally trying to deny all of our technological progress FROM A COMPUTER.\n\nNope, I'm just calling the probe that landed on the comet a very distant descendant of the stones our very distant ancestors used to kill dinner.\n\n&gt; It is our duty to be the shepherds of life on Earth because we are the only ones CAPABLE of understanding what the fuck those words mean.\n\nAnd you just gave the exact rationalization for cultural ignorance I mentioned before.

Children are very intuitive when it comes to watching parents; they WILL pick up on the little things and imitate them, so when daddy's been a racist  his whole life, more than likely the child will grow up to be as well.\n\nFor the negative experiences, it is very easily to let the first few interactions sour your views towards everyone else. It is important to remember that everyone is an individual, no matter of race, sex, or nationality. There are assholes and idiots of every colour.\n\nThe second topic is more of a social commentary. Even if it was \"natural\", we have to remember that humanity has already beaten nature in almost every aspect. We live in inhospitable lands, destroy sickness with medicines, extend unhealthy lives for many years, and can annihilate anything we wish. When we have this power, it is important to remember that we cannot be bound by \"our nature\" for nature has been bested, therefore we must best this last challenge."}, {"id": "cmngije", "body": "&gt; This is showing that it is not a genetic predisposition but rather a taught bias\n\nNo, that is a complete non-sequitur. Our tribal instincts, like most of our instincts, emerge as we age. We universally gain our \"theory of mind\" about 3-4 years of age. I don't see how you can jump from \"babies don't have it therefore it is learned\". Does that mean pubic hair is a learned phenomenon?\n\nEdit: As far as whether babies show bias or not, it appears [they actually might](http://www.medicaldaily.com/can-babies-be-racist-infants-show-racial-bias-over-fairness-when-choosing-playmates-277196).\n\nAs far as your social commentary, that seems to match exactly what the OP was saying (and I would say). For example, it is very clear that our craving for sweets and high-fat food are innate, but our cognitive brain can recognize that and overrule it, though with difficulty. Similarly, we can recognize that we are innately riddled with all sorts of cognitive biases, and chose to set aside our feelings and intuition for what is true to go with what the evidence says. (This very hard for some people, however, it seems.)\n\nSimilarly, I would say -- having looked at the evidence for about 2 decades now -- that tribal in-group/out-group instincts are triggered by just about anything: sex, race, sports teams, politics, religion, etc. The [Robbers Cave Experiment](http://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html) is a great example of tribalism emerging from completely arbitrary, random (biased) perceptions due completely due to competition.\n\nBut we can set aside that instinct, recognizing it for what it is. *That* to me is what eliminating racism is about; not eliminating any inner feelings, but in simply ignoring them."}, {"id": "2ogti2", "body": "First I want to say this is not to offend anyone.

It can easily be said that racism is purely a learned practice because how can babies be racist if they haven't grown into the cognitive ability, as far as we know, to see differences in people based on race. So where am I getting this thought?\n\nAs said before you need to look at the big picture here. As a species in the animal kingdom, we have evolved from animals who have advanced from the basic reptilian brain to a mammalian brain. Over time, these species evolved into what would inevitably be a human.

This is passed down generation to generation through genetics and culture because the people alive believe this is what helped them and there ancestors survive.\n\nEDIT: Found this study that says what I'm saying better than I can. \n\nhttp://time.com/67092/baby-racists-survival-strategy/\n\nTLDR; Because of how humans evolved, biases, namely racial in this topic, are in our DNA and are impossible to just stomp out.

My background is with horses, because I ride and own them.   A problem most people have with horses is that the horse over reacts to fear by starting, spinning, or bolting off.  As prey animals their survival depends on avoiding danger.   \n\nMany horses start out as fearful of anything new (neophobic).    But what we find is that when the animals feel secure in their surroundings and they are exposed to a variety of things,  they start to show curiosity.    Scientists have identified a \"seeker circuit\" in animal and human brains that makes the animal want novelty. ([Source]( http://ifaab.org/2009/abstracts2009.htm) section 13).   \n\nTherefore there are two ends of this spectrum:  fear which drives neophobic thoughts &amp; behavior,  and security which allows for natural curiosity to seek out and explore new things. \n\nTherefore racism isn't hardwired.   If we're living in a state of insecurity, that fear can manifest itself in a number of ways including fear of those who look or act significantly different.    It doesn't help that were taught to fear different races/cultures by sensationalistic news, backwards conservatives, and isolated pockets of ignorance.   Right now racism sells newspapers and gets certain people votes and control. \n\nBut the people who aren't so insecure and know from education/exposure to new people that a different looking person isn't a threat tend not to be racists.     The feeling of curiousity is evoked around new people.\n\nWhat we need is to live in a society where we can be sure all basic needs are met.  And we need to ensure ALL young people get education and exposure to new ideas, to cultivate our natural \"curiosity\" drive\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2ogti2", "body": "First I want to say this is not to offend anyone.

So where am I getting this thought?\n\nAs said before you need to look at the big picture here. As a species in the animal kingdom, we have evolved from animals who have advanced from the basic reptilian brain to a mammalian brain. Over time, these species evolved into what would inevitably be a human. However, to get to this point, humans needed to compete with all other species to get higher up in the food chain, including other humans. So, since natural selection shows us that the strong survive, at some point the human, or protohuman, brain tells humans that anything different is dangerous. For instance, the first meeting between an African and Caucasian most likely ended in one killing the other simply because they didn't know the the hell it was because of the difference in skin color. \n\nOur brains are wired to rely on eyesight more than our other senses so it plays even more of a role in creating biases and over the centuries and millennia, all races, with the natural instinct to defend themselves and survive, only focus on the differences instead of similarities. This is passed down generation to generation through genetics and culture because the people alive believe this is what helped them and there ancestors survive.\n\nEDIT: Found this study that says what I'm saying better than I can. \n\nhttp://time.com/67092/baby-racists-survival-strategy/\n\nTLDR; Because of how humans evolved, biases, namely racial in this topic, are in our DNA and are impossible to just stomp out.

I'm looking at this through scientific eyes so if you are extra sensitive about race and are just going to try and change my mind with rage, please don't.\n\nWhen thinking about this topic, one must look at the entire picture, but here I will just focus on one aspect. It can easily be said that racism is purely a learned practice because how can babies be racist if they haven't grown into the cognitive ability, as far as we know, to see differences in people based on race. So where am I getting this thought?\n\nAs said before you need to look at the big picture here. As a species in the animal kingdom, we have evolved from animals who have advanced from the basic reptilian brain to a mammalian brain. Over time, these species evolved into what would inevitably be a human. However, to get to this point, humans needed to compete with all other species to get higher up in the food chain, including other humans. So, since natural selection shows us that the strong survive, at some point the human, or protohuman, brain tells humans that anything different is dangerous. For instance, the first meeting between an African and Caucasian most likely ended in one killing the other simply because they didn't know the the hell it was because of the difference in skin color. \n\nOur brains are wired to rely on eyesight more than our other senses so it plays even more of a role in creating biases and over the centuries and millennia, all races, with the natural instinct to defend themselves and survive, only focus on the differences instead of similarities. This is passed down generation to generation through genetics and culture because the people alive believe this is what helped them and there ancestors survive.\n\nEDIT: Found this study that says what I'm saying better than I can. \n\nhttp://time.com/67092/baby-racists-survival-strategy/\n\nTLDR; Because of how humans evolved, biases, namely racial in this topic, are in our DNA and are impossible to just stomp out. The only way to work through it is to realize these biases and how they affect judgement whether you want them to or not.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Even if you're not done talking about this topic, and you'd still like your view to be changed in regards to the *norm* of tattoos, you've made a statement that *highly* suggests you've changed *some* view (even if that view is in regards to how applicable an absolute statement is in this case). Can you not see how people could reasonably think this means a part of your view has been slightly changed?\n\nWhat's more, you seem to suggest with this statement:\n\n&gt; I can go on judging people with tattoos so long as someone gets a delta for pettiness, or one word choice?\n\nthat you can't give a delta and then continue the conversation about your refined stance (that the *norm* is irrational). This isn't true, you can acknowledge that you were incorrect in applying an absolute and then continue right along with getting the general view changed as well, a delta isn't a sign of defeat and doesn't mark the end of a conversation. In fact, if some side conversation came about regarding something totally not related to your view in this thread and something in that changes your view on whatever they're talking about, you can award a delta for that too if you'd like.\n\nAs for all the downvotes, well, as you said yourself, you're *angry* and frankly it shows in your wording.

"}, {"id": "cmn3dgh", "body": "Your sister is a solid example of the ritual significance some people attach to either the image they choose, the process (sometimes ongoing for weeks or months) of having it tattooed, or both. Memorial tattoos and filial bond tattoos are extremely common. An image imprinted on the skin seems like a pretty rational and apt way of marking those bonds. The choice of an image associated with a group affiliation that strongly influenced your brother's life is likewise, pretty rational. As responses to grief go, it's solidly on the rational end of the spectrum. So, the image is not unique. What she did by having it tattooed on her skin was to bind her memories of your brother to the image in a way that is not only meaningful to her, but will carry import with many who see the image and learn its significance. Also, she symbolically worked through her grief with an experience of controlled, physical pain. In other words, your sister's motivations were some of the more common and most rational for getting a tattoo. Do you think at some point down the road she'll decided, \"No, I didn't like my brother that much. Boy, that was dumb!\"? \n\nFor many people, the image is almost irrelevant, but getting a tattoo serves as a rite of passage: in part, an assertion that one understands permanence, at least the impermanent permanence of one human life. For many who continue to get tattoos, it's the experience as much or more than the image that holds significance. It's the controlled and deliberate submission to pain that binds the memories of a particular time of one's life into an image on the skin. The image is a record of the ritual, and the ritual is a key to who you were at that time.\n\nI know quite a few entrepreneurs, and at least half of them have extensive tattoos. Yes, for some people it's a drunken mistake, and plenty of people have mixed feelings later in life, but for those people you see who make tattoos part of their lifestyle, and even many with a single \"I got a tattoo\" tattoo, it's part of the rhythm of their life.

"}, {"id": "cmmzzy3", "body": "Edit: Just saw your edit while I was writing my post. Sorry you had a bad time. I hope you still read this.\n\n\"People with Tatoos\": This is an important clarifying question. Are you really talking about *all* people with tatoos? Most people? You call out \"generic tattoos\" as the worst, but I'm still not clear the extent of your view here. I know someone with a tiny tatoo of a star on her hip. It's super low profile, and no one but her and intimate partners see it. There's nothing offensive about it. I'm honestly not sure if its what you mean by \"generic\", but its certainly not unique. But there's just nothing controversial about it at all. If it brought her any joy at any point in her life, I don't see how you could consider it a bad idea. But then again, you'd never know about it, so you'd never judge her for it. So maybe that's not what you're talking about? I don't know, but its an example of a tatoo that I don't think fits your schema here.\n\n\"Irrational, unintelligent or rebellious\" / \"i.e. 'bad' people\" - Here's where I think you really rub people the wrong way, and make it hard for people to address whatever your view actually is. Irrational, unintelligent or rebellious is a pretty broad swath of people, and also quite vague. But I'm especially interested in the \"rebellious\" part and how that in any way correlates to \"bad\". Maybe the quotes around \"bad\" is supposed to convey something to I don't understand from your context, but as it stands I think its severely muddying what your view is, and possibly making it seem more extreme and hostile than you intend.\n\n\"Permanence\" - I don't really get this, except for in the really extreme cases. Like you say, they can be removed. But not everyone *wants* them removed. So at worst, you can say that getting a tatoo is a risk. You *might* change your mind later, at which point you'll have to undergo a procedure. But you also might *not* want it removed. So I guess I just don't get what the big deal is here. I know a guy who is well into his 50s who still goes to tattoo parlors to extend his tatoos. And their not the secret hidden variety. It goes all the way down his leg and is clearly visible if he wears shorts. But he's married, has a wildly successful career, and his tattoos are a part of his style and self-expression. Not only does he not have regrets, but he enthusiastically continues to do work on it. He's an awesome person, so I don't get why you would place any kind of negative connotation on it. You can call him rebellious, but I don't see that as being bad.\n\nMeanwhile, I know a younger person who has tattoos that I think you would find more \"bad\" or whatever. There's one on her shoulder and one on her arm, and while they're not in any way offensive, I think they're a bit silly and less tasteful. But she got them years ago, likes them, continues to like them, and they haven't interfered in any way shape or form in her personal life. This is going back to the \"risk\" and \"not actually permanent\" ideas I mentioned. Its plausible that she might regret them in the future at some point. But its also possible she won't. And if she does change her mind, it'll be a pain to reverse, but certainly not impossible to do so. And if she does reverse them, that doesn't automatically make them a mistake. If she enjoyed them for 15 years, but *then* decides to undergo a painful/expensive procedure to remove them, does that make it a \"mistake\"? I don't think so. It still seems like an overall net positive.\n\nOn a related note to the \"risk\"/\"permanence\"/\"cost to undo\" train of thought. I put a down payment on a house last year. A 30-year mortgage feels a whole lot closer to \"permanent\" than a tattoo. I think it was the right choice, but *if* I were to have buyer's remorse in the next few years, I would *wish* that reversing it were as simple as having a tattoo removed!"}, {"id": "2ogpce", "body": "I cannot conceive of a single reasonable reason why someone would get a tattoo.

"}, {"id": "cmn15p1", "body": "&gt;I cannot conceive of a single reasonable reason why someone would get a tattoo. \n\nDecoration.  Same reason someone would want to get a nice haircut, wear certain clothes, or get braces to fix their teeth.  Their opinion is that they look better with the tattoo.  You are free to disagree, but that's a matter of opinion, not fact. \n\n&gt;Nothing - be it an idea, an interest, a love, etc. - is permanent.\n\nCorrect.  This includes the existence of one's body.  Even if the tattoo lasts for the rest of your life, life isn't forever.  \n\nWell, given that, we can actually make a rational argument even for getting a BAD tattoo, let alone a good one.  All you need to do is acknowledge that the benefit of the tattoo might outweigh the regret of having a dumb tattoo when you are old.  I mean rational rational, in real economic terms, check it out: \n\n(I assume you are familiar with the economic concept of utility here): \n\nA 20-year-old person gets a dumb tattoo, knowing that it's dumb, but they like it anyway.  They (correctly) expect to get 10 utility per year from enjoyment of having the tattoo in their 20s, 5 utility per year from it in their 30s, and -1 utility per year thereafter (due to the shame of having a dumb tattoo that they need to keep hidden most of the time.)\n\nIf they live to 70 this means they get 100 + 50 - 40 = +90 utility from the tattoo, even though they spend 20 years liking the tattoo and 30 years not liking it. \n\nSo, in literal terms, it is quite possible to rationally decide to get a tattoo, because (since people are mortal) the harm that a tattoo can do to your life is finite - even if you regret it, it's possible to come out ahead anyway, and it's possible to get the tattoo knowing you will eventually regret it and it's STILL a rational decision. \n\nNow, this doesn't always apply, but it can and does apply some of the time.

I don't care what your political movement is, it needs to be well thought out, advertising isn't cheap. The facts\n\n* Rape &amp; risky pregnancies make up only a fraction of total abortions.\n* Adoption is a real alternative for essentially all other pregnancies.\n\nThe vast vast majority are done out of convenience (no doctor appointments, no morning sickness, no worry of emotional attachment, don't have to deal with social ramification of abandoning your child etc)\n\nI think the prolife movement is focusing on the wrong things for a simple reason. They think they're going to \"convert\" prochoice people when in reality they need to sway the public's opinion.\n\nObviously people who get abortions care less about whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a parasite, fetus, zygote, bunch of cells etc, than themselves. Why even bother trying to fight that fight?\nIs talking about when their heart beats going to change their mind? Is showing a little bloody person going to change their mind? No... it's not. Because people aren't stupid. They understand all of that. It's not that they don't understand it, it's that they've done the calculation in their head and the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nSimply put they've decided that 9 months of inconvenience isn't worth it. There are some people that claim that of course the child \"would rather be dead than an orphan\" or that the world is overpopulated (factually incorrect). But it's really just about shrugging off the responsibility for 9 months. You certainly aren't required to care for the child after that by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nI think that it's become so back and forth that in many of these arguments it's almost as though prochoice people forget that adoption even exists. Because the movement stopped focusing on that and started focusing on... well I don't even know what they're focusing on? I don't understand this angle at all.\nAnd that's why I think the movement has lost its way. I think the movement needs to remind people that the 1st alternative is adoption, and drive that point home by drawing attention to the elephant in the room. That these children will never be born, simply because it's easier. \"It's my body, and this is a lot more convenient. I'll never have to go to the doctor appoints. I can still drink and party. I won't have to tell my parents. This is a lot easier. $400 later, and this will all be over.\"\n\nI fail to see how the current prolife movement will do anything besides make itself look ridiculous. It's becoming a parody of itself. No one, not even profilers like myself think a giant billboard of a fetus is helping the movement, it's hurting it.\n\nI think the strongest argument in the debate is pointing out the thing that no one wants to talk about. That we're throwing fetuses in the trash to make our lives a little easier. And somehow \"body autonomy\" is some concept to be held high... barf. I'd like to see the light shown on how \"beautiful\" that concept really is.\nCMV\n\nedit : formatting after repost (yesterday was fresh topic friday)"}, {"id": "cmmxsro", "body": "*Why the current focus is used*\n\nThis one is pretty simple.

I don't care what your political movement is, it needs to be well thought out, advertising isn't cheap. The facts\n\n* Rape &amp; risky pregnancies make up only a fraction of total abortions.\n* Adoption is a real alternative for essentially all other pregnancies.\n\nThe vast vast majority are done out of convenience (no doctor appointments, no morning sickness, no worry of emotional attachment, don't have to deal with social ramification of abandoning your child etc)\n\nI think the prolife movement is focusing on the wrong things for a simple reason. They think they're going to \"convert\" prochoice people when in reality they need to sway the public's opinion.\n\nObviously people who get abortions care less about whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a parasite, fetus, zygote, bunch of cells etc, than themselves. Why even bother trying to fight that fight?\nIs talking about when their heart beats going to change their mind? Is showing a little bloody person going to change their mind? No... it's not. Because people aren't stupid. They understand all of that. It's not that they don't understand it, it's that they've done the calculation in their head and the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nSimply put they've decided that 9 months of inconvenience isn't worth it. There are some people that claim that of course the child \"would rather be dead than an orphan\" or that the world is overpopulated (factually incorrect).

You certainly aren't required to care for the child after that by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nI think that it's become so back and forth that in many of these arguments it's almost as though prochoice people forget that adoption even exists. Because the movement stopped focusing on that and started focusing on... well I don't even know what they're focusing on? I don't understand this angle at all.\nAnd that's why I think the movement has lost its way. I think the movement needs to remind people that the 1st alternative is adoption, and drive that point home by drawing attention to the elephant in the room. That these children will never be born, simply because it's easier. \"It's my body, and this is a lot more convenient. I'll never have to go to the doctor appoints. I can still drink and party. I won't have to tell my parents. This is a lot easier. $400 later, and this will all be over.\"\n\nI fail to see how the current prolife movement will do anything besides make itself look ridiculous. It's becoming a parody of itself. No one, not even profilers like myself think a giant billboard of a fetus is helping the movement, it's hurting it.\n\nI think the strongest argument in the debate is pointing out the thing that no one wants to talk about. That we're throwing fetuses in the trash to make our lives a little easier. And somehow \"body autonomy\" is some concept to be held high... barf.

So a pregnancy, which can costs thousands and pre-natal care, and $10k in labor--THEY DON'T HAVE.  Not that many people have that available in their savings account.  So what do most people do? They go into debt.

I don't care what your political movement is, it needs to be well thought out, advertising isn't cheap. The facts\n\n* Rape &amp; risky pregnancies make up only a fraction of total abortions.\n* Adoption is a real alternative for essentially all other pregnancies.\n\nThe vast vast majority are done out of convenience (no doctor appointments, no morning sickness, no worry of emotional attachment, don't have to deal with social ramification of abandoning your child etc)\n\nI think the prolife movement is focusing on the wrong things for a simple reason. They think they're going to \"convert\" prochoice people when in reality they need to sway the public's opinion.\n\nObviously people who get abortions care less about whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a parasite, fetus, zygote, bunch of cells etc, than themselves. Why even bother trying to fight that fight?\nIs talking about when their heart beats going to change their mind? Is showing a little bloody person going to change their mind? No... it's not. Because people aren't stupid. They understand all of that. It's not that they don't understand it, it's that they've done the calculation in their head and the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nSimply put they've decided that 9 months of inconvenience isn't worth it. There are some people that claim that of course the child \"would rather be dead than an orphan\" or that the world is overpopulated (factually incorrect). But it's really just about shrugging off the responsibility for 9 months. You certainly aren't required to care for the child after that by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nI think that it's become so back and forth that in many of these arguments it's almost as though prochoice people forget that adoption even exists. Because the movement stopped focusing on that and started focusing on... well I don't even know what they're focusing on? I don't understand this angle at all.\nAnd that's why I think the movement has lost its way. I think the movement needs to remind people that the 1st alternative is adoption, and drive that point home by drawing attention to the elephant in the room. That these children will never be born, simply because it's easier. \"It's my body, and this is a lot more convenient. I'll never have to go to the doctor appoints. I can still drink and party. I won't have to tell my parents. This is a lot easier. $400 later, and this will all be over.\"\n\nI fail to see how the current prolife movement will do anything besides make itself look ridiculous. It's becoming a parody of itself. No one, not even profilers like myself think a giant billboard of a fetus is helping the movement, it's hurting it.\n\nI think the strongest argument in the debate is pointing out the thing that no one wants to talk about. That we're throwing fetuses in the trash to make our lives a little easier. And somehow \"body autonomy\" is some concept to be held high... barf. I'd like to see the light shown on how \"beautiful\" that concept really is.\nCMV\n\nedit : formatting after repost (yesterday was fresh topic friday)"}, {"id": "cmmyc8d", "body": "OP, the way you talk about pregnancy and abortion makes you seem wholly uninformed.

I think the movement needs to remind people that the 1st alternative is adoption, and drive that point home by drawing attention to the elephant in the room.

Big claims require big proof.  Can you please provide unbiased evidence of your claims?  Exactly Exactly what %?\n\n \n\n\n&gt; Adoption is a real alternative for essentially all other pregnancies.\n\nYou claim that \"risky pregnancies\" don't happen often.   I believe ALL pregnancies are risky.   Any pregnancy can result in the woman getting a serious infection, needing surgery, an extended hospital stay, or death.    until you can find a way to solve these very serious problems, I feel like you're disregarding the health and life of a woman.  How can one be pro life but force a woman to do something she doesn't want and may kill her?\n\nAdoption isn't an option if the fetus has serious birth defects.   It's not an option if the cells never quite divided properly in the first place but kept growing anyway (molar pregnancy).\n\nAdoption isn't an option if the egg implanted outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy)\n\nAdoption isn't an option to a sick woman who needs chemo or other toxic drugs to protect her own health knowing the drugs will cause defects. \n\nAdoption isn't a reasonable option to a woman who isn't mentally healthy.  Taking control of her body for the next 9 months may send her over the edge and she wants to die.\n\nIs it an option if the woman risks losing her job, her home, her boyfriend to be forced to carry to term?   It's not \"Convenience\" that makes these women feel they have no choice. \n\nWhy don't you address the reasons why women seek abortion?   Do that and there won't be demand for it.  Why isn't birth control free and easily accessible to all?  Why is it so difficult to get sterilized?   Why aren't obgyn appointments for birth control/ pregnancy always free to everyone?   How about free taxi rides for people who don't have a car and can't walk to the obgyn?    Better condoms that don't break?   Better education and no more of the useless abstinence only lecture?    Reform of employment laws in all states so women aren't paid less, fired for pregnancy,  etc.  Why doesn't the us have paid guaranteed maternity leave like other 1st world countries? \n\n\n&gt;I think the prolife movement is focusing on the wrong things for a simple reason. They think they're going to \"convert\" prochoice people when in reality they need to sway the public's opinion.\n\nYou can't sway a significant amount of public opinion without swaying those who side with choice.\n\n&gt;Obviously people who get abortions care less about whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a parasite, fetus, zygote, bunch of cells etc, than themselves. Why even bother trying to fight that fight?\n\nWhat if I told you many women who get them are very sad to be forced to make this choice.    It's not uncommon for a woman to grieve.  There are special grief counselors just for this situation. \n\n&gt; Is talking about when their heart beatsgoing to change their mind?\n\n\nWomen aren't stupid.  They know the fetus heart starts beating early on.  It makes the choice more emotionally upsetting but it doesn't change the reasons why a woman feels she must do it.\n\n\n\n&gt;Is showing a little bloody person going to change their mind? No... it's not.\n\nThis is where you're wrong. A fetus is not a person.  It's a *potential* person.  But one can argue that birth control also destroys *potential people* by denying the eggs a chance to be fertilized. \n\n\n&gt;Simply put they've decided that 9 months of inconvenience isn't worth it. \n\n\nMay I ask: have you given birth? \n\nI had my first child this year.  She's a beautiful angel who we wished and planned for -- but as much as we were excited the pregnancy and birth was far far more than some little inconvenience. \n\nno matter how much you love babies, to call pregnancy an \"inconvenience\" shows such denial of what pregnancy is like.   It's willful ignorance of the permanent changes pregnancy and childbirth make to the body.  It ignores that any pregnancy comes with it risk of hemorrhage, infection, or death for the woman.   It ignores how common gestational hypertension,  pre eclampsia, hyperemesis, and gestational diabetes is.  How about a third of all delivers require major surgery (c section) .   Even a routine vaginal birth can cause such tearing it goes through connective tissue and muscle,  taking months to heal.   \n\nEconomically the pregnancy and birth can easily cost $30,000 in medical bills in the us.  Not everyone has insurance.    Who has $30k in case laying around?   Although not technically legal, you will find many stories of women who could get hired or who were let go because of pregnancy or delivery.   \n\nInconvenient is when you go to the grocery store and the only parking spots left are in the back row.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; There are some people that claim that of course the child \"would rather be dead than an orphan\" or that the world is overpopulated (factually incorrect). \n\nYou keep calling it a child but you don't back up this claim with any facts.  It's not a child.  It cannot live independent outside of the uterus.  It is not physically or cognitively developed to the level of an infant.  If you can call a fertilized egg a \"child\" why can't I call an unfertillized egg during unprotected sex a child?\n\n&gt; But it's really just about shrugging off the responsibility for 9 months. You certainly aren't required to care for the child after that by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nWho is required to care for the woman for those 9 months and for her recovery?    Who is required to care for the woman who is required to be on bed rest?  Who cares for her for the month post delivery while her c section heals?   Who cares for the woman who gets an infection and ends up hospitalized?    \n\nWill you care for me?   I had a 2nd degree tear and massive internal and external hemorrhoid from 12 hours of labor.  Who drove me back to the hospital emergency room 3 days after discharge because of these complications?    Where were you when my blood pressure kept going up around time of birth and once it crossed 160/100 I felt so sick and needed urgent help.   Where were you when I had to soak my perineal tear stitches several times a day in a sitz bath in agonizing pain? \n\nWho will care for the women who struggle with post partum depression?   It's a very common problem.   Do those women deserve to suffer for months or years in order to reproduce against their wishes?\n\n&gt;I think that it's become so back and forth that in many of these arguments it's almost as though prochoice people forget that adoption even exists. \n\nAdoption isn't the answer to everything.  Focusing only on adoption. fails to acknowledge the reasons why women feel they need to terminate.    Adoption isn't the answer to ectopic pregnancy or serious birth defects.

They think they're going to \"convert\" prochoice people when in reality they need to sway the public's opinion.\n\nObviously people who get abortions care less about whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a parasite, fetus, zygote, bunch of cells etc, than themselves. Why even bother trying to fight that fight?\nIs talking about when their heart beats going to change their mind? Is showing a little bloody person going to change their mind? No... it's not. Because people aren't stupid. They understand all of that. It's not that they don't understand it, it's that they've done the calculation in their head and the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nSimply put they've decided that 9 months of inconvenience isn't worth it. There are some people that claim that of course the child \"would rather be dead than an orphan\" or that the world is overpopulated (factually incorrect). But it's really just about shrugging off the responsibility for 9 months. You certainly aren't required to care for the child after that by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nI think that it's become so back and forth that in many of these arguments it's almost as though prochoice people forget that adoption even exists. Because the movement stopped focusing on that and started focusing on... well I don't even know what they're focusing on? I don't understand this angle at all.\nAnd that's why I think the movement has lost its way. I think the movement needs to remind people that the 1st alternative is adoption, and drive that point home by drawing attention to the elephant in the room. That these children will never be born, simply because it's easier. \"It's my body, and this is a lot more convenient. I'll never have to go to the doctor appoints. I can still drink and party. I won't have to tell my parents. This is a lot easier. $400 later, and this will all be over.\"\n\nI fail to see how the current prolife movement will do anything besides make itself look ridiculous. It's becoming a parody of itself. No one, not even profilers like myself think a giant billboard of a fetus is helping the movement, it's hurting it.\n\nI think the strongest argument in the debate is pointing out the thing that no one wants to talk about. That we're throwing fetuses in the trash to make our lives a little easier. And somehow \"body autonomy\" is some concept to be held high... barf. I'd like to see the light shown on how \"beautiful\" that concept really is.\nCMV\n\nedit : formatting after repost (yesterday was fresh topic friday)"}, {"id": "cmmxlbk", "body": "The problem is that both sides are focused on the wrong half of the equation.

I don't care what your political movement is, it needs to be well thought out, advertising isn't cheap. The facts\n\n* Rape &amp; risky pregnancies make up only a fraction of total abortions.\n* Adoption is a real alternative for essentially all other pregnancies.\n\nThe vast vast majority are done out of convenience (no doctor appointments, no morning sickness, no worry of emotional attachment, don't have to deal with social ramification of abandoning your child etc)\n\nI think the prolife movement is focusing on the wrong things for a simple reason. They think they're going to \"convert\" prochoice people when in reality they need to sway the public's opinion.\n\nObviously people who get abortions care less about whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a parasite, fetus, zygote, bunch of cells etc, than themselves. Why even bother trying to fight that fight?\nIs talking about when their heart beats going to change their mind? Is showing a little bloody person going to change their mind? No... it's not. Because people aren't stupid. They understand all of that. It's not that they don't understand it, it's that they've done the calculation in their head and the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nSimply put they've decided that 9 months of inconvenience isn't worth it. There are some people that claim that of course the child \"would rather be dead than an orphan\" or that the world is overpopulated (factually incorrect). But it's really just about shrugging off the responsibility for 9 months. You certainly aren't required to care for the child after that by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nI think that it's become so back and forth that in many of these arguments it's almost as though prochoice people forget that adoption even exists. Because the movement stopped focusing on that and started focusing on... well I don't even know what they're focusing on? I don't understand this angle at all.\nAnd that's why I think the movement has lost its way. I think the movement needs to remind people that the 1st alternative is adoption, and drive that point home by drawing attention to the elephant in the room. That these children will never be born, simply because it's easier. \"It's my body, and this is a lot more convenient. I'll never have to go to the doctor appoints. I can still drink and party. I won't have to tell my parents. This is a lot easier. $400 later, and this will all be over.\"\n\nI fail to see how the current prolife movement will do anything besides make itself look ridiculous. It's becoming a parody of itself. No one, not even profilers like myself think a giant billboard of a fetus is helping the movement, it's hurting it.\n\nI think the strongest argument in the debate is pointing out the thing that no one wants to talk about. That we're throwing fetuses in the trash to make our lives a little easier. And somehow \"body autonomy\" is some concept to be held high... barf.

Giving someone a few thousand dollars out of your own pocket to help with the cost of raising a child is far more genuine and goes further than rolling your eyes, complaining it's not your responsibility, and then calling the woman an immoral slut.  A 3 week fetus is the same as a 3 week old newborn, you say?  Well, if you're willing to pay money out of your own bank account to keep a newborn alive, you should be willing to pay your own money to keep a fetus alive.

If you do nothing, this tumor will develop into a 5 to 10 lb mass inside a quart of retained fluid, during which time you'll experience discomfort and permanent, visible changes to your body. Meanwhile your doctor has informed you that you can't take anything for the discomfort, drink, smoke, lift heavy objects at your job, eat a very long list of foods, clean your cat's litter box, do any activity with a risk of falling, and much more -- restrictions that complete strangers will feel obligated to enforce in your life, for safety's sake. If you're unlucky, you might also end up confined to a bed for weeks or months. After about nine months of this...you'll need to either expel the tumor from your body in a drawn-out, excruciatingly painful process (you'll have the option of partial pain relief via a long needle inserted into your spine) or have major abdominal surgery. Either way, you're then to have a mandatory weeks-long absence from work to recover, during which you might not receive pay, as well as a hospital bill in the thousands, and that's IF you doesn't develop further complications which can include a fairly high risk of weeks of uncontrollable vomiting, diabetes, or permanent urinary incontinence, and non-negligible risks of hemorrhage, life-threatening blood clots and/or death.\n\nOr, you can take a pill as soon as you're diagnosed, and all that will never happen.

Of course, that doesn't mean that men are wrong, it just means that it's incredibly easy for them to overlook or be oblivious to a certain set of experiences.\n\nI think that when talking about abortion, the anatomy of the person giving an opinion, which in most cases, but doesn't necessarily correspond to their gender, is important, since pregnancy is a very real situation for about half of the population. I've seen enough abortion debates on this forum that are dominated by clueless male pseudo-philosophers presenting irrelevant/useless thought experiments and have the privilege of having to not even worry about the subject matter being directly applicable to them, saying incredibly ridiculous things on the subject because they lack important perspective. While it's certainly possible for women to engage in the same behavior, it's really far less likely in practice.\n\nSo, it's not OP's gender that matters, it's their birth sex assignment that matters, because this is a topic where one's anatomy **strongly** influences ones perspective on abortion.\n\n&gt; There's plenty of men AND women ignorant about how their own bodies work, including pregnancy\n\nAbsolutely. That being said, if someone on the internet is being largely ignorant about pregnancy and the experience that pregnant women have to go through, what anatomy are they more likely to have?

From a pro-choice viewpoint, the foetus is simply the potential to become a child, in much the same way that a gamete has the potential to be fertilised and become a zygote. Gametes aren't special, foetuses aren't special, but what is special is people's right to decide what they do with those things - whether they decide to have unprotected sex and give the gamete a greater chance of being fertilised, or to abort a foetus so that it does not develop into a child.
