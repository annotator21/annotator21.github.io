There are many variations of bottle designs, but overall we can group these into two categories: \"cap on top\", where the cap is at the top of the bottle and as far from the base as possible, and \"cap on bottom\" where the bottle actually sits on its cap.\n\nCap on bottom designs are a fairly recent invention, made possible by the use of arbitrary plastic shapes for liquid packaging. So I understand that cap on top designs are entrenched, culturally.\n\nSome products (often shampoo and conditioner pairs) actually use the same packaging, but with labels in opposite orientation to suggest that one end our the other is the top. I don't care about that: my only concern here is that the product can sit stably on the cap, regardless of whether the text is now upside down. I would count that as a \"cap on bottom\" design because the bottle can sit on its cap without concern of toppling.\n\nMy argument is very simple: cap on bottom designs are better, because as the remaining liquid gets to a low level, it remains by the spout and can easily be ejected. Otherwise, high-viscosity liquids require a lot of shaking and squeezing to eject from the bottle, as they have settled to the end furthest from the spout.\n\nI believe cap on top designs (defined here as designs where the bottle cannot rest on its cap without being at risk of falling over) are functionally inferior, with no functional advantages. The only advantage to them at all is that, by having no concern for stability, the cap can be artistically shaped for visual pleasure in arbitrary ways. I don't think this is anywhere near as important as being able to easily access the contained product, and this I believe I would be happier if all liquid shower products had cap on bottom designs.\n\nPlease try to convince me that the \"cap on top\" design has redeeming qualities, so I can stop being annoyed by them.\n\nCMV!"}, {"id": "cmwlnse", "body": "One word: *kids*.

IIRC, something like 3/4 of student loan dollars come from the feds.\n\nSecond, student loans used to be bankruptable.  There were some scandals with med students finishing school and promptly filing BK.  \n\nDiscretionary authority exists among bankruptcy judges already to refuse discharge of debts entered into when the debtor planned to file, for example.  That authority could be expanded on and guidelines established to look specifically at immediate post-graduation/disnerollment bankruptcies.\n\nAnother possible solution would be to require that student loans can only be discharged through Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  On Chapter 13, you have to enter a payment plan and live on a pretty strict budget, with all excess income going to your debts for 3-5 years.\n\nBut I think that bringing student loans into a well-established legal institution for dealing with debt is a good idea in the long run, even if some special rules need to be adopted to prevent abuses.

Or are you saying that scholarships should be available to **all** students instead of student loans, making the US more like Europe with its subsidized universities?  \n\nBecause if you're not saying scholarship money is available for all or most students, and if you're not saying the US should switch to subsidized education, then you are effectively saying that your own situation is irrelevant to the vast majority of college students. It doesn't matter if you were able to win the few competitive scholarship awards available: the simple fact is that scholarships don't have the funding required to cover all students. Which necessarily means most students must seek other sources of funding, like loans.  \n\nDoes it change your point of view knowing that most students by definition cannot have access to scholarships? \n\nWould you then say that those students simply shouldn't go to college? But then what would happen to American industries who find themselves unable to find qualified employees in the coming years? Should the entire country become less qualified and less capable of competing in a global economy, just because the idea of easing student debt burdens offends you? \n\nStudent loan debt is currently around [$1.2 trillion](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/10/25/student-loan-debt/17773131/): it's the largest single source of private debt outside of home mortgages ($13 trillion). It therefore exerts an enormous downward pressure on the economy, as young educated people just entering the workforce find their buying power greatly reduced (average student loan debt for people 20-29 is $25,500). And unlike a mortgage, you can't sell your degree for equity or take a HELOC loan.  \n\nThe US government made $66 billion in profit on student loans from 2007 to 2012. Bully for people who like to lower federal deficits, right? But does it make sense to lower corporate and capital gains taxes on the backs of young students just trying to make their way in the world? The feds should not be profiting off people trying to get an education: it makes far more economic sense for them to pump money into educating young Americans than to extract money from them.  \n\nFinally there's an underlying problem that affects **all** students, and parents, regardless of whether they personally take on student loan debt or not: [tuition hikes](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2012/0606/Student-debt-What-s-been-driving-college-costs-so-high-anyway). Everybody knows American university tuitions have been rising far above the rate of inflation for a couple of decades. The reasons why are complicated, but it seems pretty likely that cutbacks in state budgets have been largely to blame. As state university systems, formerly generously subsidized Euro-style to enable in-state students to afford college, have seen their public endowments shrink, they have naturally shifted to other sources of revenue. One major source of revenue: tuitions. Federally-subsidized student loans... which count among the best-secured debts in the entire country... have risen to fill the gap. And you can see that a vicious cycle is born. Colleges need money, so they raise tuitions. In order to meet the higher costs, students borrow more. Congress increases borrowing limits, and universities raise tuitions again. Now, rather than competing for endowment funds and direct federal grants, the way universities used to do, they can compete for the ability to increase tuitions, and increase the loans available to pay tuitions. \n\nIt is these large, complex, macroeconomic shifts in the cost of education that people want to see addressed. Reducing the student debt burden on young people will help boost consumer spending and therefore drive the economy. Reducing the cost of education in the first place will broaden the availability of education to more people, thereby making the country as a whole more competitive globally. \n\nThis has nothing to do with scholarships."}, {"id": "2ph14y", "body": "I'll start this off by saying that I am in my last year of high school, and I will hopefully be attending a school that is about 60k a year.

I know of a few for law and medicine (and I'm sure there are others that I don't know about because I don't personally know people using them).  And they aren't just coddling people who decided to go to expensive schools and didn't want to think about who was going to pay for their schooling.  The debt forgiveness programs have tangible benefits from society.\n\n\n For example, there are several doctors that I know who had their student loans reduced or forgiven in exchange for working in underprivileged areas (think Appalachia region).  These are regions that pay very very little, but have a high need for services.  Someone with a lot of debt would not be able to afford to work in that area, as they would have to prioritize salary over everything else.  By offering loan forgiveness, it is making it possible for quality doctors to choose to work in these areas.  You can't expect someone to want to live out in the middle of nowhere, with very little resources (hospitals don't have the necessary equipment, constantly understaffed so you are going to have to take on more work), for a salary you are struggling to live on, AND also have a mountain of debt to work off.  Without loan forgiveness programs, the good quality doctors would not choose to live in those conditions and e underserved areas would be even worse served.\n\n\n\n I have another friend who is a Harvard educated lawyer.  She wants to work with children who have been abused. Not surprisingly, that is the kind of law job that pays next to nothing.  It is also a high burnout job that few people want. The amount of loans she had to take to get a Harvard law degree means that without loan forgiveness, she would not be able to do that.  She simply wouldn't be able to afford to live and pay back her loans.  So instead of working for abused children (an area of law that sorely needs better lawyers than they can attract with the salary the state gives) she would be working for a big firm, doing work that is much less rewarding.  Because of loan forgiveness, she is able to help these children instead of rich businessmen.\n\n\n\n\nEducation is really expensive.  Someone who graduates with a prohibitive amount of loans has to go for the job that makes a lot of money to pay it off.  This leads to a brain drain to big corporations, and away from certain areas of need.  Loan forgiveness allows people to prioritize differently.  It gives our best and brightest the opportunity to contribute to the world, instead of just working for whoever pays them enough to pay off their loan.  We stagnate society by forcing people to prioritize money over other values.  And a huge loan is forcing someone to make money their number one priority (maybe forcing isn't the correct word, but it definitly contributes in a substantial way to the decision making process)."}, {"id": "2ph14y", "body": "I'll start this off by saying that I am in my last year of high school, and I will hopefully be attending a school that is about 60k a year.

I feel like people should be allowed to walk around naked if the weather permits and they want to.  The primary arguments against it seem to be either religious modesty or \"we can't let our children see that.\"\n\nAs a none religious person I base my morality off a simple question: Does this action harm another individual?  Sometimes if the answer could be yes, we can analyze the situation and determine that the person \"harmed\" is actually wrong (I.E. someone saying something silly offends them.)  I cannot see how someone being nude can harm another person.  If you don't want to see it, then don't look.  I understand an unattractive person not wanting their SO to see an attractive person naked, but the internet exists and their SO can see the hottest people on the planet naked with the click of a button.  Also, their SO is going to be thinking about that the next time you're together, and their sex drive will be better as a result.  Furthermore, people become desensitized to nudity rather quickly.  If public nudity became mainstream, it wouldn't take long for people to not even really think about it any more.  To me that makes that argument moot.\n\nChildren exposed to nudity is a much more controversial topic, and I think the line has to be drawn somewhere, but I think shielding them from any information is definitely not where the line should be drawn.  We obviously don't want our children to grow up with a skewed view of sex (so obviously they shouldn't watch some fetish porn or something) but does it really do some kind of damage to a child to see someone naked?  We are the only animal on the planet that covers up, and as far as I know, the only animal that won't allow children of the species to view sexual acts.\n\nObviously I don't want someone hurting my kids, or trying anything sexual with them, so having a guy in the bushes jerking off is definitely past where the line should be drawn, but I really see no harm whatsoever in my kids seeing people walk around in the natural form.  I don't think it will cause any damage and I think it will actually be psychologically good for them, since they won't be led to believe that something is wrong with their body so they have to cover it up.\n\nAm I seriously demented or is this a more common view than I'm aware?  Change my view?\n\nP.S.  Is it against the rules to comment on a post saying something like \"I agree with you, but here are the arguments that I've heard against your view,\" or are replies limited only to people who disagree?  The rules state not to make a post like that, but I'm not sure about a reply.\n\nEdit: I didn't think about the sanitary effects of public nudity.  Perhaps some restrictions such as \"you cannot be in a situation where you would be in physical contact with another human or your genitals would be in contact with someone else's property or public property.\"  That rule would allow someone to walk down the street, ride a bike, drive their car, swim, lay on the beach, sun tan in their front yard, etc. while prohibiting things like riding the public bus naked.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Most people who realize they aren't attractive won't display the level of nudity that's currently legal, but some will, and in those cases we can simply look away if it isn't something we want to see."}, {"id": "cmwug49", "body": "As long as you're willing to shoulder all the implications of changing this societal norm I don't have much I can say.

I feel like people should be allowed to walk around naked if the weather permits and they want to.  The primary arguments against it seem to be either religious modesty or \"we can't let our children see that.\"\n\nAs a none religious person I base my morality off a simple question: Does this action harm another individual?  Sometimes if the answer could be yes, we can analyze the situation and determine that the person \"harmed\" is actually wrong (I.E. someone saying something silly offends them.)  I cannot see how someone being nude can harm another person.  If you don't want to see it, then don't look.  I understand an unattractive person not wanting their SO to see an attractive person naked, but the internet exists and their SO can see the hottest people on the planet naked with the click of a button.  Also, their SO is going to be thinking about that the next time you're together, and their sex drive will be better as a result.  Furthermore, people become desensitized to nudity rather quickly.  If public nudity became mainstream, it wouldn't take long for people to not even really think about it any more.  To me that makes that argument moot.\n\nChildren exposed to nudity is a much more controversial topic, and I think the line has to be drawn somewhere, but I think shielding them from any information is definitely not where the line should be drawn.  We obviously don't want our children to grow up with a skewed view of sex (so obviously they shouldn't watch some fetish porn or something) but does it really do some kind of damage to a child to see someone naked?  We are the only animal on the planet that covers up, and as far as I know, the only animal that won't allow children of the species to view sexual acts.\n\nObviously I don't want someone hurting my kids, or trying anything sexual with them, so having a guy in the bushes jerking off is definitely past where the line should be drawn, but I really see no harm whatsoever in my kids seeing people walk around in the natural form.  I don't think it will cause any damage and I think it will actually be psychologically good for them, since they won't be led to believe that something is wrong with their body so they have to cover it up.\n\nAm I seriously demented or is this a more common view than I'm aware?  Change my view?\n\nP.S.  Is it against the rules to comment on a post saying something like \"I agree with you, but here are the arguments that I've heard against your view,\" or are replies limited only to people who disagree?  The rules state not to make a post like that, but I'm not sure about a reply.\n\nEdit: I didn't think about the sanitary effects of public nudity.  Perhaps some restrictions such as \"you cannot be in a situation where you would be in physical contact with another human or your genitals would be in contact with someone else's property or public property.\"  That rule would allow someone to walk down the street, ride a bike, drive their car, swim, lay on the beach, sun tan in their front yard, etc. while prohibiting things like riding the public bus naked.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Now, I know what you're thinking- they downvoted you for besmirching feminism!  No.  The incredulity was that I said female privilege was a thing and when I answered the \"totally respectful feminist\" who \"politely\" asked for examples I pointed to the legal system and how women serve 40% the sentence men serve for the same crimes and make up something like 3% or 4% of the prison population.\n\n* First Counterargument:  This is actually oppression because women are seen as fragile children who can't do time or couldn't hurt someone so badly.  \n\nNo.  This isn't oppression.  Yes, it's sexism.  But it's women benefiting from sexism, which is what I understand as the definition of privilege (An unfair advantage rooted in some bigotry or other, eg White Privilege) \n\n* Second Counterargument:  Men commit more crime, so they're a larger portion of the prison population.\n\nWell this is pretty obviously bigotry, so I'm just going to say \"It's the same racist argument racists make, but they swap out \"men\" for \"the blacks\"\" and move right along.\n\n* It's not privilege, it's \"benevolent sexism\".\n\nNo.  This is a double standard that does a backflip over facts and turns \"women get an unfair advantage here\" into \"women get an unfair advantage here **but** they're still the victim\".\n\nThis is on the order of calling sexism against men \"reverse sexism\".
