But by talking about it like it's entirely their fault is to absolve any blame from the content of the film and to belittle the value of their feelings in the world. \n\nThey can do all the petty attacks against luxuries like Pornhub and Netflix they want... I actually think those companies have better encryption and security policies than even Sony, sad to say. But just because they pirated some movies, that gives us the right to go in and kill thousands of innocent people? To upset the balance of global power?

For my comment, lets assume that North Korea is responsible for the hacking.\n\nI am by no means an expert on military capabilities, but I have trouble believing that we \"could take out the regime...in a matter of weeks.\" I am not sure how shitty their missiles are. I believe they are in commission, somebody feel free to come in to correct me. Sure they may not be able to bomb L.A., but our allies such as S.K. and Japan are well within range. Do we really want to put our allies in that type of risk? And if we do, how will we deal with the inevitable international fallout? From the looks of it, S.K. and Japan do not want war. Another regarding the nukes, we have to first question why they have these nukes in the first place? I am inclined to say that this is a bargaining chip so that U.S. and their allies won't be so inclined to attack N.K. This position implies some sort of rationality regarding North Korea, which I will deal with later on.\n\nAnother thing that we mustn't forget is the not so cuddly panda behind N.K.: China. Recall that back in the Korean War in the 50s, China came to N.K.'s aid and reversed their fortunes. The situation is of course very different, i.e. China was raging to prove it's legitimacy, and the very legitimate threat of first N.K., next China mentality that the vehemently anti-commie U.S. had at that time. However, I am inclined to believe that an attack on N.K. won't sit very well with China. \n\nThen the next matter which I saw in one of OP's responses is N.K.'s rationality. It seems OP's argument is centered around the fact that N.K. is a crazy country and that if they are so serious about a stupid movie, what are they going to do in the future? Well, first off I am going to say that most if not all international leaders or actors are rational, i.e. they are utility maximizing. In fact, my thoughts on the deceased Dear Leader Kim Jong Il is that he was a brilliant leader. I have come to this conclusion by looking at N.K.'s past decisions in the 90's North Korea Nuclear Proliferation decision. \n\nDuring that time was when our Dear Leader started to rapidly ramp out its Nuclear capabilities. At that time, President Clinton was seriously contemplating whether to invade N.K. or not. However, Mr. Lewinsky hesitated. The reason for this hesitation was the question of what does North Korea want? If North Korea wanted nuclear armament so they could attack other countries such as S.K. and U.S., then there was no helping it. No matter what concessions or \"goodies' that U.S. and its allies offer, its pointless. That should be obvious. Orr alternatively, all N.K. wanted was respect and the the ability to use its nukes as bargaining chips for any international disputes. Its possible that Dear Leader did not want to use nukes at all because after all, he is living the high life. Why would he risk getting ensnared in a war where he would surely lose (albeit without inflicting heavy possibly even irreparable costs to U.S. and their allies). \n\nGiven N.K. is non malicious, U.S. should not give any concessions and should just let N.K. build its nukes. If U.S. runs with that rationale, N.K. will have no reason to build its nukes because the nukes were there just to get \"goodies.\" That is why Dear Leader has incentive to misrepresent N.K.'s utility curve. Basically he became like a rabid dog and said \"death to America, South Kolea blah blah.\" Mr. Lewinsky figured that N.K. was more in between the two types of N.K. I was talking abut (completely malicious N.K. and non-malicious N.K.). Long story short, N.K. got some goodies and respect for developing its nukes, and the whole world has not degenerated into nuclear fallout. If you look at the outcome, N.K. did VERY well. Dear Leader died in his sleep after a great 20 more years at the top, and N.K. got lots of goodies and respect from the rest of the world. For that very reason, I am inclined to say that N.K. is a rational actor.\n\nGiven that N.K. is rational, I believe this cyber attack is just a mini thing for them to say \"hey respect us\", just as they have done multiple times in history. At the end of the day, I don't believe they want war, and they are careful enough to not do anything drastic enough that U.S. will ever consider going to war with them.\n\nThis next part is a little bit more personal. I find issue with you saying that we must attack them before we lose pornhub and netflix. I am sure you are joking around as I have done with some parts of my post. But you do know how serious war is, right? People die. I mean living, breathing people. North Koreans, Americans and their allies whatever. It is very unrealistic to map this out like a Civilization game and just go \"lets attack!\" There is an extremely human element to this. And to just go oh boy what are we going to do without our porn and beloved tv shows, ok guess we can always go to war. The first reaction I honestly had from reading this post was \"if we could easily take care of North Korea in a matter of weeks, don't you think we would have done this sooner?\" To me there is just something very irresponsible and even a little childish to go at this issue with this viewpoint.\n\nTL;DR It is harder to attack N.K. than we think (China and nukes being the main issue). N.K. is rational and don't want war; they just want respect. It is very silly to just sacrifice human lives because we are losing our entertainment.\n"}, {"id": "2pofyc", "body": "North Korea has demonstrated an ability and intent to carry out cyber attacks against the U.S.  This time, it was because of a Seth Rogan Movie, but nothing is stopping them from carrying out further cyber attacks for propaganda purposes or whatever reason they want.

Increased immigration to close the gap and ways to encourage couples to have more kids through tax breaks and the like.

It is a phenomenon called [demographic transition.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition)\n\nBasically, when a nation's standard of living increases, people stop having as many kids. This is due to a few reasons.  When medicine isn't as developed in your country, you are going to have more kids both to have a greater chance of having at least some of them surviving childhood illness and reaching adulthood, and because much of the work in less developed countries is manual labor such as farming, and wouldn't you know it, kids are a source of free labor for you! \n\nHowever, as a country's economy improves, more opportunities become open to the individual. There is more education available to get into more specialized fields, with a large subset of the population waiting longer to enter the workforce.  Nations tend to become more liberal as they develop (not in every case, but for the most part this trend sticks), meaning women have more opportunities to do things with their lives other than giving birth and raising kids, causing lower birth rates. And since medicine is better in developed nations, one doesn't need to have as many children to try to continue your family line. Birth control is also more widely available.\n\nSo yes, the shrinking of birth rates in developed nations can cause some growing pains like the ones you mentioned (social security, an aging work force in an increasingly technologically advanced society, etc.), but this trend of demographic transition is reasonably predictable, so we can't exactly be surprised by it.  This just means that we must plan for the inevitable.  \n\nThe thing about demographic transition models is that it assumes the more advanced a society becomes, the higher the standard of living is. And, for example, this is definitely true in the US compared to where we were at 50 years ago. However, increasingly we are seeing income inequality become a problem around the world. The idea is that despite the social security system looking like its heading to its doom, as an increasingly prosperous nation, this shouldn't be a problem because when there are less people, the per capita wealth should go up, minimum wage should increase, and there shouldn't be as much need for social security. But this isn't what is happening and the average wealth is actually decreasing in relation to the cost of living.  \n\nThis leads us to possible outcomes for the future. If income inequality isn't addressed and the birth rates don't actually decrease, we could meet a terrible fate. This was the prediction famously made by Thomas Malthus, more or less, called the [Malthusian catastrophe.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe) Basically Malthus said that populations would continue to exponentially grow ([which looks like this](http://biology.unm.edu/ccouncil/Biology_112/Images/exponential.gif)) until our agricultural production couldn't keep up and the population would crash. However, there is a more optimistic possibility that says if we continue to develop and make sure that the standard of living raises for everyone in a society, our population will level off, meaning we hopefully wouldn't have to worry about things like social security. This kind of growth can be seen in [this graph.](http://14yunhyu.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/logistics.gif)\n\nThis is the hope for environmentalists, that the world will develop into a more equal global society which would naturally stabilize population growth, and then we can work on increasing our technology and minimizing human damage to the environment. \n\ntl;dr Basically, decreasing birth rates *can* be a problem, but they don't have to be. In fact, this can actually make our lives better. But we have to plan for this and ensure that income is more equal to not have serious problems facing us down the line.

Pretty much every immigrant wave to the US has become more affluent over a few generations and had their birth rate decline as well.  You can see this in other western nations, but it is most pronounced in the US due to being true each new immigrant wave.  What's important to realize is that birth rates, especially without immigration, are a factor that determines maximum growth of an economy.  More people entering the economy = more growth.  \n\nThe real problem (insomuch that a shrinking economy is a problem) in western countries is not declining birth rates, but increased political opposition to immigration.  I'm not advocating any particular immigration policy or stance, but to not understand that introducing policies that heavily restrict immigration is naturally going to have a negative effect on economic growth is a serious mistake.  We can see this right now in the economy of Japan and we'll see it soon in most of Western Europe if Islamophobia has a big impact on immigration policy there (and it's increasingly looking like this is the case).\n\nEDIT: Reading some of your responses in the thread it seems you don't accept immigration as a valid solution to this problem due to social complications.  Let the history of the US be your guide, immigrants only strengthen the nation, and are far more successful than natural born citizens even controlling for racial background.  Example, Chinese immigrant is far more likely to be successful than an American of Chinese ancestry born in the US).

For example, let's consider two friends Jane and Anna. Jane has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $25k per year and Anna has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $150k per year. Assuming both women have similar incomes and lifestyles before children, most child support calculations would award Anna much more child support than Jane. But why? Is Anna's child more deserving of money than Jane's child?\n\n* Why should calculations assume a relationship or marriage? Many child support calculations are based on the income that would have been dedicated to the child if the parents lived together. If a woman gets pregnant from a one night stand or a non-serious relationship, why should there be any assumption by the courts that the parents would have lived together and raised the child together? A married couple living together with children spend their income differently than single people without children. So why should a relationship be assumed and considered when it did not exist in the first place?\n\n* Why is standard of living important? Some child support calculations take into account the accustomed or increased standard of living when calculating support amounts. Let's be honest here, is there ever really a need for $5k per month in child support? Just because someone is wealthy, why does that mean they are automatically expected to provide a high level of financial support to their children. Where exactly is that money going? In most cases it isn't all going to the child and I think that is problematic. The point of child support money is for support of the child, not the creation of an expensive lifestyle for the child and custodial parent. \n\nIn my opinion, a basic formula should be developed (adjusted for cost of living by area) that accounts for the average amount required to support a child's basic monthly needs at varying age levels. This amount would take into account food, transportation, clothing, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. The child support amount could be then simply read off a table rather than dedicating time and resources into courts and legal decisions. \n\nIf this amount is more than 15% of monthly net income, the child support paying parent would be limited to pay 15% as support for that child. A parent shouldn't be struggling financially to pay their own bills in order to be able to keep up with child support payments. \n\nFor parents where this amount is less than 15% of monthly net income, they would pay the set amount as given by the formula.\n\nIf parents have 50/50 joint custody, there would be no child support awarded, because both parents should be equally supporting the child. For other custody situations the child support amount would be calculated down or up based on custody percentage. \n\nSo am I missing something here? To me what I've described above seems to be a much fairer system than the way child support is currently calculated. So please, CMV. \n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That is, if one parent can afford to shower the child with gifts and the other can't, the child may/will tend to appreciate that parent more. If the child can live in a big mansion with a huge room, big-screen TV in their room, lots of expensive toys, etc., versus a small room in a modest house with the other parent, the child will tend to want to stay with the richer parent.\n\nThe *idea* at least seems reasonable. My problem with it is the implementation. The standard of living approach is what we use in Canada. The way they calculate it actually violates the very principle it is supposed to be built on. \n\nThe way they do it is they make use of a statistical metric used to measure trends in standard of living, called the 40-30-30 rule. This rule recognizes that due to economics of scale, that a 2nd person in a house does not require double the income for the people to enjoy the same standard of living. That is, you don't need a house twice as big, twice as much energy, twice as much utility costs, etc. But you do need more income. If you start with one adult of some nominal income $X, call them 1 Adult Equivalent Unit (1 AEU). Estimates for the added amount for others have suggested about 40% more (0.4X) for the 2nd person, then 30% more (0.3X) for each subsequent person, i.e., 1 person = 1 AEU, 2 people = 1.4 AEU, 3 people = 1.7 AEU, 4 people = 2 AEU, etc. Another approach is using sqrt: AEU = sqrt(n) for n people, which gives about the same for reasonable family sizes: 1, 1.41, 1.73, 2.\n\nSo far so good, except that this metric is admittedly arbitrary by Statistics Canada (and other national statistical institutions). It used to measure trends over time and not a literal equivalence of standard of living. Fine, but let's move on.\n\nSo to calculate child support (in Canada), they set the non-custodial/primary parent's house to 1 AEU and calculate their after tax amount, minus child support payment, CSP. They then set the custodial/primary parent's house to the number of AEUs and calculate their after tax income *plus* the CSP, e.g., for 1 child:\n\n(X-tax - CSP)/1AEU = (Y-tax + CSP)/1.4AEU\n\nYou can then solve for CSP. What this would do, in principle, is set the available money to spend in the two houses such that both houses enjoy the same standard of living. Sounds like it fits the principle of equalizing households as above, right? Nope.\n\nNote that the non-custodial parent is assigned 1 AEU. That means their house and cost is treated as if they were a single person *with no children* to pay for. That is, it assumes they don't need an extra room, extra bed, etc. No added costs for travel, visitations, Christmas and birthday gifts, etc. It assumes their house will be 40% smaller, more or less. In other words, it assumes they have zero involvement in the child's life that would add any costs. Any actual costs related to the child that the non-custodial parent might have *reduces* their standard of living compared to the custodial household.\n\nAlso note this equation sets *all money available* to equalize the standards of living. That is, *everywhere* that money goes. Sure, a 40% bigger house, 40% more electricity and water, 40% more food, etc. But also 40% more gifts, 40% more savings. If the non-custodial parent can afford $100 gift for the child, this equation means the custodial parent can afford $140 gift for the child. This flies in the face of the whole point of the principle about one parent \"buying\" the love of the child. One has a smaller house with no bedroom or bed for them and gives smaller gifts.\n\nIt gets worse. After setting these household \"equal\" in standard of living, there are added costs. Child care is added over and above this equalization, even though child care is de facto included in the 40% for that child. Costs like sports and education are also additional. And, of course, spousal support (alimony) is independent and additional. So the custodial parent will generally have much more than 40% more to spend on needs.\n\nThere is one slight fix, of course, which is that the calculation of CSP arbitrarily replaces Y = X. That is, rather than take in both incomes, it arbitrarily assumes that the custodial parent (Y) makes as much as the non-custodial (X). Since the Y = mother usually and X = father usually, and women *tend to* make less overall than men statistically (though may not in a given pairing), this tends to help equalize those issues, but only marginally. Statistical estimates suggest it only corrects for costs if the non-custodial parent only sees the child 5% of the time.\n\nBut even beyond that, it makes no sense for this arbitrary change given the goal principle in the first place. It also makes no sense to ignore the particulars of the given parents on the basis of some generalized statistics. \n\nOverall, it's just a very poorly designed system.

No, fathers should not be \"mildy inconvenienced\" by the child support. Fathers should be made to pay the amount that is required for the child to have a decent living. If that is inconveniencing, fine, let it be so. If he makes 7 figures and a figure of, say $2k is not inconveniencing, also fine. Also, notice how child suport is directly tied to one's income, yet the \"day to day struggles of child rearing\" is not.

If you did, and still he kept being stingy while claiming he loved you, then he might simply be an asshole. \n\nEither way, I'm sorry about your situation, but the truth is: if the father wants to be a stingy asshole, it's his right to do so as long as he provides for a decent living for the child. If the father refuses to recognize or even see the child, once again, it's his right to do so, provided he suports.

Some also consider age of the child, difference in income between parents, standard of living adjustments, etc. \n\nIn theory I get it, but the implications in practice really bother me and I think the basis behind the laws regulating child support calculation are a little outdated and unfair. \n\nHere's a summary of my objections: \n\n* Above a certain amount why should income be taken into account? For example, let's consider two friends Jane and Anna. Jane has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $25k per year and Anna has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $150k per year. Assuming both women have similar incomes and lifestyles before children, most child support calculations would award Anna much more child support than Jane. But why? Is Anna's child more deserving of money than Jane's child?\n\n* Why should calculations assume a relationship or marriage? Many child support calculations are based on the income that would have been dedicated to the child if the parents lived together. If a woman gets pregnant from a one night stand or a non-serious relationship, why should there be any assumption by the courts that the parents would have lived together and raised the child together? A married couple living together with children spend their income differently than single people without children. So why should a relationship be assumed and considered when it did not exist in the first place?\n\n* Why is standard of living important? Some child support calculations take into account the accustomed or increased standard of living when calculating support amounts. Let's be honest here, is there ever really a need for $5k per month in child support? Just because someone is wealthy, why does that mean they are automatically expected to provide a high level of financial support to their children. Where exactly is that money going? In most cases it isn't all going to the child and I think that is problematic. The point of child support money is for support of the child, not the creation of an expensive lifestyle for the child and custodial parent. \n\nIn my opinion, a basic formula should be developed (adjusted for cost of living by area) that accounts for the average amount required to support a child's basic monthly needs at varying age levels. This amount would take into account food, transportation, clothing, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. The child support amount could be then simply read off a table rather than dedicating time and resources into courts and legal decisions. \n\nIf this amount is more than 15% of monthly net income, the child support paying parent would be limited to pay 15% as support for that child. A parent shouldn't be struggling financially to pay their own bills in order to be able to keep up with child support payments. \n\nFor parents where this amount is less than 15% of monthly net income, they would pay the set amount as given by the formula.\n\nIf parents have 50/50 joint custody, there would be no child support awarded, because both parents should be equally supporting the child. For other custody situations the child support amount would be calculated down or up based on custody percentage. \n\nSo am I missing something here? To me what I've described above seems to be a much fairer system than the way child support is currently calculated. So please, CMV. \n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Some also consider age of the child, difference in income between parents, standard of living adjustments, etc. \n\nIn theory I get it, but the implications in practice really bother me and I think the basis behind the laws regulating child support calculation are a little outdated and unfair. \n\nHere's a summary of my objections: \n\n* Above a certain amount why should income be taken into account? For example, let's consider two friends Jane and Anna. Jane has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $25k per year and Anna has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $150k per year. Assuming both women have similar incomes and lifestyles before children, most child support calculations would award Anna much more child support than Jane. But why? Is Anna's child more deserving of money than Jane's child?\n\n* Why should calculations assume a relationship or marriage? Many child support calculations are based on the income that would have been dedicated to the child if the parents lived together. If a woman gets pregnant from a one night stand or a non-serious relationship, why should there be any assumption by the courts that the parents would have lived together and raised the child together? A married couple living together with children spend their income differently than single people without children. So why should a relationship be assumed and considered when it did not exist in the first place?\n\n* Why is standard of living important? Some child support calculations take into account the accustomed or increased standard of living when calculating support amounts. Let's be honest here, is there ever really a need for $5k per month in child support? Just because someone is wealthy, why does that mean they are automatically expected to provide a high level of financial support to their children. Where exactly is that money going? In most cases it isn't all going to the child and I think that is problematic. The point of child support money is for support of the child, not the creation of an expensive lifestyle for the child and custodial parent. \n\nIn my opinion, a basic formula should be developed (adjusted for cost of living by area) that accounts for the average amount required to support a child's basic monthly needs at varying age levels. This amount would take into account food, transportation, clothing, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. The child support amount could be then simply read off a table rather than dedicating time and resources into courts and legal decisions. \n\nIf this amount is more than 15% of monthly net income, the child support paying parent would be limited to pay 15% as support for that child. A parent shouldn't be struggling financially to pay their own bills in order to be able to keep up with child support payments. \n\nFor parents where this amount is less than 15% of monthly net income, they would pay the set amount as given by the formula.\n\nIf parents have 50/50 joint custody, there would be no child support awarded, because both parents should be equally supporting the child. For other custody situations the child support amount would be calculated down or up based on custody percentage. \n\nSo am I missing something here? To me what I've described above seems to be a much fairer system than the way child support is currently calculated. So please, CMV. \n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Do you know think there is a point where the amount of child support becomes ridiculous? 1k, 2k, 10k, 50k? \n\n&gt;The \"bias against men\" in custody hearings is entirely choice based, in that the men don't want custody. If they attempted to get custody then they wouldn't be paying child support. If the man gets full custody then guess what: the mother pays child support.\n\nEvidence to support this? I don't believe that the bias against men is entirely due to not wanting custody. There are many many stories of men being denied custody in favour of an unstable mother. Further, the data I have seen shows that men who are given custody are much less likely to receive awarded support and the amounts are significantly lower. "}]}
