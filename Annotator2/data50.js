Evolutionary changes are results, not causes. \n\nTo expand on this a bit, Evolution is slow. Like, really really really slow. Mutations happen randomly, and they sometimes give an advantage, and sometimes they give a disadvantage. Sometimes the advantage they give doesn't matter, as the subject dies from an unhappy accident well before it gets a chance to mate. As a result, it takes a lot of generations before you get widespread changes in a population(depending in part on how harsh the selective pressure is). \n\nAs humans, we have trouble fully grasping how big some of the numbers we talk about really are. If it takes 10000 generations to get significant differences, and each generation takes 10 years, that's 100,000 years. That's so far back that your brain doesn't really fully register how long it is. This is part of why I really like the calender year perspective on time scales. It turns numbers that are really hard to understand into a much more recognizable fraction.

There was never a fish which gave birth to a quadruped. \n\nEvery animal is the same species as it's parents. The thing you need to look at is populations. A good analogy is languages. \n\nPremise 1 - French and Spanish are distinct languages. \n\nPremise 2 - every child spoke the same language as their parents. \n\nWith both of these premises being true, how could the two languages share a common ancestor? \n\nBy very small changes adding up over a long period. You have group of people who splits into two, maybe over a territorial issue or maybe because one group finds a new area to live. The two are now separated and do not directly interact very much. In each group over the generations people develop accents in different ways, saying words a little differently. Some have different names for animals which they originally shared but prefer at a different rate, some make up new words to better describe a particular idea. Over time these changes keep adding up, all the while not mixing between the two groups. After many years the new accents and words along with the changes in meanings of shared words make the two languages distinct enough to not be considered the same. The point where we would consider them different languages is the point where one cannot understand the other. This is called speciation. \n\nIf you want a good example of this look at ring species. These are a type of animal who live at a geographical divide, such as a mountain range. The original species moves to the mountain from nearby and starts to breed, let's say from the north . They spread out along both directions of the mountain range. As they are unable to live up in the tops of the mountains, they start to have two distinct populations, those on the left and those on the right for example. Over time the animals continue to move further south on either side of the mountain, all the whole accruing small changes which make them distinct. Eventually the populations have grown down both sides of the mountain range and meet at the bottom. But a strange thing happens. The south-east species can't breed with the south-west species. The south-east can breed with the east, the East with the north-east, the north-east with the north, the North with the north-west, the north-west with the West, and the West with the south-west. But the two at the south can't breed. This is because the small changes don't cause complete infertility in one go, but when they add up over a larger time you can't breed well enough to form a single population. \n\nThere is a species of lizard in California which has gone through this exact experience and is well documented. \n\nIf this can work over this small scale it shows the process. If we can then make predictions based on this about what should be found where we can then verify or falsify the applicability of this theory to longer time scales. \n\nI want you to have a look at an species called Tiktalik. This is a transitional form between fish and lizard. The fossil was found based on predictions made by the scientists involved. They looked at what they already knew about the earliest land animals and where on Earth the animals just prior to them should have lived. They then looked for a place on Earth now where land from that layer and environment was currently exposed. They went digging and found the exact type of fossil they were looking for.

In short, cognitive dissonance is the psychological tension that you experience when you hold two conflicting beliefs or ideas; or when your beliefs and your actions are not congruent. Cognitive Dissonance makes people uncomfortable, so to alleviate this discomfort, one of two things needs to happen: the person needs to either accept one of these ideas over the other, or they need to rationalize the two conflicts. \n\nFor instance, consider smoking as an example. In this situation, our hypothetical person smokes cigarettes, and yet, they know that cigarettes are bad for your health. This person's actions and beliefs are incongruent.

Nothing in the book claims that the account in Genesis *has* to be taken literally and to claim that would require evidence to support it. It doesn't require you to abandon faith. In fact, many (most) people who believe that the current Theory of Evolution is *currently* our best model are religious people. During cases in the court of law, the people defending Evolution are chosen due to their knowledge on the subject and religions *and* non-religious people are chosen to help back it up.\n\n \n\n&gt;Additionally, I feel that there is no evidence for the possibility of spontaneous generation, which I feel would be necessary for the first life form, from which everything else is descended.\n\n \n\nThere is an important distinction here. You are making a connection between Abiogenesis and the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection and Genetic Mutation. While many people who understand and accept Evolution as the best *current* model of explanation believe that life started from non-life, it *isn't actually necessary* because they are technically non-overlapping magisterial.\n\n \n\nIf you don't support the current ideas about Abiogenesis, you COULD believe a Creator did it and still believe in the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection, because the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection *only* is relevant when life *already exists*. While we have ideas about how life could possibly have been created, we don't currently have an answer that is definitive. It is very fair to withhold belief until there is sufficient evidence.\n\n \n\n&gt; I am unable to refute many of the other posts here, but I remain unconvinced because I do not know how the first ancestor existed.\n\n \n\nAgain, how the first ancestor got here is irrelevant to Evolution and so you should consider the facts that you have not been able to refute.\n \n\n&gt;This is entirely based on an interpretation of Genesis. I wouldn't say that I am certain of these things, but I have accepted them.\n\n\nJust for consideration, the Bible is generally considered (by everyone who has ever existed and not followed an Abrahamic faith) to be a collection of stories that have little to no factual basis. Would you be willing to put the Bible to the same level of scrutiny as you do scientific ideas?\n\nAgain, not to attack but I *am* curious. Is it fair to dismiss actual scientific knowledge based on your religious text? Is there a more fair way to compare the two? Especially since the Bible never actually *says* that it's version of creation has to be taken literally?\n\n&gt;The concerns I have with using this as evidence of evolution, and these concerns may be part of a misunderstanding of evolution, are that we do not see living examples of these steps, while we do have living examples of less evolved primates.\n\nBy definition, Evolution happens in slow and gradual steps. If you *require* evidence that takes place very rapidly in large, multicellular animals, then you are requiring evidence for something *other* than the actual theory.\n\nScientists believe that the ancestors to Humans and Chimpanzees/Bonobos split approximately 5-7 million years ago. If you are requiring \"intermediate forms\" to be living today, doesn't that mean that you are expecting species to not go extinct? Basically ever?

Extinction and the removal of species is what opens up new niches for new life forms that are better adapted to those situations.\n\n&gt; Evolution, as I understand it, doesn't hold that homo erectus converted to homo sapiens it holds that homo sapiens evolved out of homo erectus.\n\nThis is correct for an important reason. Saying \"Homo erectus converted to homo sapiens\" would mean that every single member of Homo erectus gave birth to a Homo sapien. Instead, if we evolved from Homo erectus, part of the population developed traits that led to Homo sapien, then coexisted for a bit and Homo sapien eventually survived and Homo erectus died out.\n\n&gt; Would it not then hold that homo erectus would be more viable than various forms of primates? Why would homo erectus go extinct before these primates?\n\nThis is another *very important* part of your misunderstanding (and probably of no fault of your own). Most people think of humans as \"the pinnacle\", at least of the primates. **But this is wrong**.\n\nHumans are not the \"goal\" of Evolution. We are the product of selection that took place with our ancestors, which took a slightly different path than our proverbial cousins.\n\nHomo erectus becoming extinct has nothing to do with Chimpanzees, Gorillas, etc. because they were never in competition with each other. *WE* were the competition of Homo erectus.\n\nAs it turns out, our closest relatives ARE endangered because of *us*. If Homo erectus went into the part of the world where Chimpanzee's ancestors were evolving, they would probably start competing against Chimpanzees. Maybe they would do better because of their upright gait and intelligence. It is *also possible* that the ancestors of Chimpanzees would have an advantage, because they were probably much stronger than Homo erectus, just like Chimpanzees are MUCH stronger than Homo sapiens.\n\nIf two species are competing in the same area for the same (or similar niche), THEN it might be feasible to ask why one survives and the other doesn't. But our ancestors lived in a different place and time than our other relatives, so they have no bearing on each other.\n\n&gt;I would be willing to consider it and would even appreciate it; although, I feel that the more important issues for me are the issues with the common ancestor and the extinction of homo erectus.\n\nI hope we can move on to this, but I would like to clarify any questions you have with Homo erectus as well.\n\n&gt; I suppose my lack of understanding of those issues are the greatest inhibitor to an acceptance of evolution.\n\nWhile Evolution by Natural Selection can basically be boiled down to a simple *concept*, it's *finite details* are complicated. Unfortunately, they also help bring the entire thing together so we can't just put them to the side.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, I do not understand how changes can be selected for which aren't immediately useful.

Nothing in the book claims that the account in Genesis *has* to be taken literally and to claim that would require evidence to support it. It doesn't require you to abandon faith. In fact, many (most) people who believe that the current Theory of Evolution is *currently* our best model are religious people. During cases in the court of law, the people defending Evolution are chosen due to their knowledge on the subject and religions *and* non-religious people are chosen to help back it up.\n\n \n\n&gt;Additionally, I feel that there is no evidence for the possibility of spontaneous generation, which I feel would be necessary for the first life form, from which everything else is descended.\n\n \n\nThere is an important distinction here. You are making a connection between Abiogenesis and the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection and Genetic Mutation. While many people who understand and accept Evolution as the best *current* model of explanation believe that life started from non-life, it *isn't actually necessary* because they are technically non-overlapping magisterial.\n\n \n\nIf you don't support the current ideas about Abiogenesis, you COULD believe a Creator did it and still believe in the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection, because the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection *only* is relevant when life *already exists*. While we have ideas about how life could possibly have been created, we don't currently have an answer that is definitive. It is very fair to withhold belief until there is sufficient evidence.\n\n \n\n&gt; I am unable to refute many of the other posts here, but I remain unconvinced because I do not know how the first ancestor existed.\n\n \n\nAgain, how the first ancestor got here is irrelevant to Evolution and so you should consider the facts that you have not been able to refute.\n \n\n&gt;This is entirely based on an interpretation of Genesis. I wouldn't say that I am certain of these things, but I have accepted them.\n\n\nJust for consideration, the Bible is generally considered (by everyone who has ever existed and not followed an Abrahamic faith) to be a collection of stories that have little to no factual basis. Would you be willing to put the Bible to the same level of scrutiny as you do scientific ideas?\n\nAgain, not to attack but I *am* curious. Is it fair to dismiss actual scientific knowledge based on your religious text? Is there a more fair way to compare the two? Especially since the Bible never actually *says* that it's version of creation has to be taken literally?\n\n&gt;The concerns I have with using this as evidence of evolution, and these concerns may be part of a misunderstanding of evolution, are that we do not see living examples of these steps, while we do have living examples of less evolved primates.\n\nBy definition, Evolution happens in slow and gradual steps. If you *require* evidence that takes place very rapidly in large, multicellular animals, then you are requiring evidence for something *other* than the actual theory.\n\nScientists believe that the ancestors to Humans and Chimpanzees/Bonobos split approximately 5-7 million years ago.

Religiously motivated beliefs are always sensitive, and having a serious and mature discussion about them is difficult at best. But too many people never really take the time to question their beliefs about the nature of the universe - despite how important they may be! - so I'm always delighted to meet someone who does.\n\nOkay, let's see. You believe birds and dogs don't have a common ancestor. Yet they share many similar features - two eyes, two nostrils, a mouth, four limbs and a tail, brain in the skull, lungs and heart in the ribcage, all other vital organs in the abdomen... I could go on. They are similar to each other in a way that they are not similar to, say, a jellyfish or a carrot.\n\nOf course this doesn't prove anything. Such similarity doesn't have to indicate common descent, just a common designer. If all animals were made by the same being in the same way, you'd expect some similarities to show up. But you would probably not expect any meaningful pattern in the similarities.\n\nHow would you tell whether two species are related? Well, presumably you'd look at various traits of those animals - ideally, their DNA, if you can get it - and see how similar they are. The more two species have in common, the more recently they must have diverged. And if you take a large number of species, you can draw a [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) showing how closely related they are to one another. This is like a \"tree of life\" picture you may have seen, with the leaves representing currently living species and the branches representing their various ancestors.\n\nNow, if the world was created 6,000 years ago with the animals fully-formed, I would expect to see those trees \"cut off\" at that point. You'd have several leaves joining up into larger branches, and then stopping. Since there were no ancestors past that point, any similarities between animals are because they live in similar environments, not because they have family relations. Which means the similarities between animals present at the creation of the world should be more-or-less random, while the similarities between their descendants should follow their family structure.\n\nBut we don't see this. The tree structure continues all the way back, and there's no visible cutoff around the 6000-year mark. Or anywhere. You can draw a diagram like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Tree_of_life_SVG.svg), purely from DNA analysis, unifying all life from bacteria to humans. (We're on the right edge of the red sector - look for \"Homo Sapiens\".)\n\nFor that matter, I can think of a living thing that wouldn't appear on that tree: a synthetic life form created in the lab. We can almost make life from scratch. We certainly know what something that shares no common ancestors with us would look like. Such a creature would have less in common with us than we have with a flu virus. We know what you get when you create two life forms that don't share a common ancestor, and they certainly wouldn't be anywhere near as similar to each other as dogs and birds."}, {"id": "2o6paa", "body": "I first learned about evolution as a young child.

How is it that us and a monkey can come from the same gene pool.  Though we look somewhat similar there are too many little unique differences between us that make it impossible to imagine all of the changes that must've taken place inbetween.  But if you think about things in the right way, you begin to realize some things that make things more understandable.\n1) Genetic Variety\nLook at all the people around you.  Look at all the types of dogs, cats, and other plants and animals that have been bred to varying degrees.  While this does not tell us the whole story by itself.  It shows us that genes in fact do have a lot of flexability.  Once you except this premise you can begin to start to examine in detail what degree of flexibility these genes have.   Scientists have been doing this for years now and they have gotten to the point where they can not only tie physical and mental traits to genes but they can also see the lineage behind a particular type of animal.  I`m sure there`s enough links posted on this thread to look at on your own, but philosophical it is important that you see and understand this concept.\n2)  Speciation\nMany Christian websites seek to play a semantics game over the definition of this term in order to confuse people from properly grasping the concept.  I`m not going to spend a lot of time on this, but suffice to say species arise when for physical or environmental reasons two animals are no longer to mate anymore.  To get from our common ancestor with chimps to where we are now, you need a lot of little steps and grey areas.  Over time residual genes will be flushed out or carried on vestigaly.  \n3) Shared Forms and Functions\nI couldn`t think of a better title for this section, but the basic point I want to make here is that though animals come in all shapes and sizes, anatomically, we all share the structures.  I think the top post shows a really good example of this with the whale examples, but it`s a really strong piece of evidence in support of evolution.  Not only can you see with whales, but you can see it with all closely related species and this evidence corroborates with the DNA evidence we`ve gathered over the years.  (you can even see this in our own species with males and females sharing the same reproductive structures expressed differently genetically.  Again this shows to what degree genes can be altered)\n4) Viability\nWith this last concept I`m going to go kind of deep so it might be hard to follow, but I think it`s important, not in just understanding evolution but also understand form and function in general. In short, things only exist because the conditions for them exist, exist. Weird thing to say I know, but this gives rise to a new way of viewing the world.  I first picked up this world view when I got into philosophy in high school.  Buddhism in particular made me see the world in different terms and when i was able to do this, things like evolution began to make more sense.  \nTo demonstrate this in a thought experiment let`s look at you yourself.\nWhy are you able to live.\nOne reason is that you`re well suited to your environment in that you can easily adapt to any slight changes (be it weather, the air, whatever).  But there is a  limit to this.  Say, for example you lost all access to food accept for food that was poisonous to you, like berries or some kind of fruit.  If you could not adapt to this change you would lose the sustenance you need to exist.  Likewise if the temperature suddenly fell well below zero and you didn`t have a jacket you would be screwed as well.\nAll of this is pretty obvious right? \nWell now take these ideas and apply them to groups of individuals and through genetic variance and all of the things I talked about into the mix.\nIf there conditions of an environment allow for something to exist, they will.\nIf the conditions change to the point that a species cant exist they will all die and only if some of them have a mutation or the genetics to save them will ensure the survival of their species.  This is an obvious oversimplification of Evolution (there are tons of other things that drive genetic changes-mating patters,random mutations,etc\n) but as someone from a religious background I imagine you were raised to see things as separate forms, whole in their creation, as is the philosophical underpinnings of Judeo Christian tradition.  \nIn reality, things are interlinked and codependent and slight variations in this network of interdependence can cause vast changes, especially when time is a factor.\nWith this view biological evolution not only makes sense, but so does geological and physical evolution.  We live in a universe where forces are constantly acting upon each other which puts us in a state of constant flux.  Life developed perception so that we wouldnt be moving around in a state of random particles (though some primitive animals do see the world more in those terms)  Our response to aesthetics and emotions also have evolved over time and have led us to appreciate this beautiful universe in which we exist.\nI don`t know if this was helpful at all, but hopefully it go you think about things differently a little bit."}, {"id": "2o6paa", "body": "I first learned about evolution as a young child.

With your much broader base of knowledge, are you aware of any counterexample to this?\n\nWell, it might be true, it's just not how the major ethicists have universally understood their positions.  If something like a Millian argument is right, that it's evident from the experience or nature of pleasure that it be an intrinsic good, then moral judgments based on this end don't seem to be based on intuition--except in the broadest sense that takes \"intuition\" as meaning any sort of information being apprehended from acquaintance with the world.  Or if something like a Kantian argument that truly moral reasoning can only be determined by universal principles, and the only universal principles which can determine moral reasoning are the formulations of the categorical imperative...  Or some kind of contractarian argument that it follows from what we mean by morality hat morality it is how rational beings negotiate their use of freedom in community...  Or some kind of virtue ethical argument that morality can only be meaningfully construed in terms of the perfection of the moral agent, and the stakes of our perfection are objectively grounded in general facts about human nature...  These are arguments attempting to provide a ground for ethical distinctions other than intuition--whether they ultimately work."}, {"id": "cmkbzkk", "body": "Logic cannot tell us if something is true or false. It can only tell us that if certain things are true (or false), then other things must also be true. So the problem with applying logic to ethics is where you get your basic facts in the first place.\n\nUnder utilitarian ethics, the basic facts are the outcomes. But we still need to know what constitutes a good or bad outcome. For example, if the goal is to minimize suffering, then we have the problem that we don't actually know that the deaths of the five people in the trolley problem will cause more suffering than the death of the one. If the train kills everyone instantly, and if we assume that dead people don't suffer, then it seems utilitarianism would be concerned with minimizing the suffering of the survivors. But what if the five people are a family, so killing all of them means that nobody has to suffer the loss of a family member? Perhaps the total suffering in the world is actually less that way.\n\nAnd of course, there's no basic utilitarian justification for \"minimizing suffering\" being the goal. That's just something we chose. You could equally well say that the utilitarian goal is to maximize economic value. That seems wrong, doesn't it? Maximizing economic value seems like much less of a worthy ethical standard than minimizing suffering. But isn't this just \"an adherence to instinctive reasoning?\" Why, other than instinct and intuition, should we say that human suffering is more important than dollars?\n\nSo I would say that both utilitarian and deontological ethics are grounded in \"instinctive reasoning\" and both apply logical reasoning to these basic facts. They just do it in different ways.\n\nThe trolley problem encourages us to take a basic mathematical fact (5 &gt; 1) and place it in the position of a moral argument. But this then introduces a *duty to kill*, which seems like a pretty bad idea. How far does this duty extend? What if, instead of the unrealistic certainty given in the problem, I'm only *reasonably sure* the trolley will hit the 5 people? Do I still have a duty to kill the one person, or to push the fat man off the bridge? Does it make a difference how long the tracks are - should I still pull the lever if the trolley will take a day or a month or ten years to get to the 5 people?\n\nDo I have a duty to kill in other areas? For example, suppose my neighbor has a severely polluting car. He absolutely refuses to get it fixed, and I have run the numbers and found that if he continues to drive it for the 10 more years it will remain operational, that 5 people will die of respiratory diseases who would otherwise live. My neighbor lives in an impenetrable fortress, so I can't damage the car, but tonight he has left a window open, so I have the one-time-only opportunity to shoot him with a rifle. Do I have a duty to kill my neighbor? If not, what's the difference?"}, {"id": "cmkfc55", "body": "&amp;#8710;\n\nI am not sure how this has changed my view just yet, just that it very much has.

The emotions convince us to act in a way that is optimal beyond what we can comprehend (large-scale societal benefits, etc.),  whereas logic gives the optimal answer when we have a complete set of knowledge to work with. \n\nThe answer obviously becomes much more dependent on emotion when we complicate the situation, as it obscures our ability to properly weight and be certain of the outcome."}, {"id": "cmk81dz", "body": "It's not absolute at all - if I were presented with a good enough argument I would definitely change my view."}, {"id": "cmkdxtk", "body": "You have refused to even entertain the arguments posed so far, so why do you think we are under the delusion that you might listen to one? You came here so that we could change your view for the sole purpose that you could not view your friends as horrible people due to the fact that they would not pull the lever. So, instead of arguing as to why pulling the lever, or not pulling it, is the right choice or not, I will argue as to why you shouldn't think your friends are horrible people. \n\nFor one, you have a utilitarian view of human lives. Very few people see the world like this, most of us do not count lives and add it up to get the fewest number of deaths no holds barred. A much more popular opinion is that killing people is bad. I'm actually going to bet money that your friends hold this view of the world, killing someone who is not trying to kill you is a deplorable act. This is almost the complete opposite of a humanitarian view, but that does not mean it is still not a valid view on human life. \n\nThat is key. Just because they disagree with you does not make their view any less valid than yours. This isn't math, you can't prove one view is better or worse than the other, you can only offer philosophical arguments. In fact, it is quite healthy that they disagree with you. If you and your friends agreed on everything, especially this one, then not only would all of your conversations devolve into a massive circlejerk (which you may prefer IDK, to each his own) but it would introduce a huge confirmation bias into your life. \n\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, your friends are not comfortable with killing people. They see the act of pulling the lever as killing someone. You don't have to agree with them, but that is how they see the problem. At this point, you are now calling them potentially horrible people on the one basis that they are not comfortable killing someone. That doesn't sound like a very utilitarian view to me. Instead, you should commend their friends. \n\nBy choosing to not pull the lever, your friends are actually making two choices. They chose to *not* murder someone, and they chose to stick by their morals. They don't see the world like you do, they don't see it as choosing to let another 4 people die. They see it as killing someone intentionally or not killing them.

Perhaps those 5 people were child murderers and that 6th person would have gone on to cure cancer.\n\nYou can't possibly know all the facts in the scenario, so while your rationale for choosing the 5 over the 1 seems sound it could ultimately lead to you making the wrong decision and causing the net loss of life to be much higher or the net amount of suffering in the world to be much higher than inaction.\n\nYou chose to murder hoping that your purely pragmatic decision works out for the best, but those friends of yours who refuse to pull that lever aren't as interested in the numbers as they are the morality of their own actions (which is the only thing they can truly know and have any control over).\n\nOr to put it another way, the end doesn't justify the means.

Not so sure about Magnificence and Greatness of soul for example and would definitely include benevolence, kindness and compassion. As applied to the trolley problem, different moral agents have different characters and will respond differently in the same situation. This particular problem has such awful outcomes one way or another I don't think it is clear cut that choosing to sacrifice one for the sake of five is necessarily the choice every virtuous person would make. \n\nOne virtuous person,  truthfully knowing they tend to make poor decisions under pressure decides not to pull the lever reasoning that they cannot possibly make a considered choice in the time available. This decision takes great courage and truthfulness about oneself because they will have to live with the deaths of the five people and knowledge that they could have prevented those deaths. Additionally it shows benevolence, kindness and compassion because the agent recognising their inability to make an informed decision, have acted to minimise as much harm as justifiably know they can do.\n\nAnother virtuous person, much quicker minded under pressure decides to take no action. In an instant they recognise the choice before them and realise truthfully, courageously, benevolent, kindly and compassionately that the choice of who should live or die in this particular circumstance is not one they can justifiably take. This second virtuous person has not chosen to *not* pull the lever and has chosen to not interfere through lack of justification. Although the practical results are the same, the lever does not get pulled, the reasons and application of the virtues are very different. \n\nIt's important to note this second person considers in this particular circumstance they are not justified to choose who lives and dies. It's not always unjustified to do this as in many cases doctors with limited resources justifiably choose to treat some patients over others knowing that people will die as a result of their decisions. Doctors are not infallible however and at times their decision to treat one patient over another was made in error and not justified. At this point I'd normally launch into a discussion of the importance of practical wisdom *(phronesis)* though that is another conversation.\n\nI'll admit to not having a good example of a virtuous person who would pull the lever. At least not without adding information to the example such as stipulating the one person is a serial killer and the 5 innocent children.

Just to give you one example of a possible difference you may not have thought of: it might be wrong to treat a person as a means to an end, rather than an end in themselves. In the switch example, you are not using a person as a means (you use the switch and track as the means, and the person happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time).

The point of a formalized philosophy is to extend our intuitions to edge cases where they conflict. No (widespread) moral philosophy disagrees about whether the random murder of an innocent for no good reason is acceptable. Rather they differ in their interpretations of complex situations that require a more rigorous definition of \"good\" to evaluate. \n\nMy point is, at least in my opinion, you can't prove that Kantianism is \"false\" (because that doesn't really mean anything when applied to moral ideas) but you can show that it doesn't agree with most human's moral intuitions on base cases that seem pretty strong.

Axioms can't be wrong, but they're not useful if they don't correspond to our built-in hardware.\n\nRationality doesn't prescribe terminal goals, only intermediate. I agree that Kant's philosophy is internally consistent, but I don't think it actually corresponds to how people act and think. I feel confidant you can construct scenarios where almost anyone will be willing to murder instead of dealing with the alternative consequences, and so far as I can tell a majority of people blame others for things that occurred early because of inaction.\n\nEverything is relative, but some things are less relative than others.
