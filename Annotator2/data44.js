You may view it as an inconvenience, they may view it as completely life altering/ruining decisions. Your PR strategy can be completely thwarted by just a few truly heart wrenching stories about either 16 year olds being tricked about birth control, forced out of an abortion dying in childbirth, or about a mother of 3 who thought she was infertile, again somehow prevented from getting an abortion, losing her job due to the pregnancy, getting her kids taken from custody and now alone and homeless. It doesn't take much to show that some abortions aren't trivial or because of simple inconveniences. \n\nbut say your campaign works and rich white guys decide abortion is evil, dirty, lazy whatever. So now what have you done? Well you've completely trivialised one of the most important things women deal with - this is likely going to extend into other things. I mean, women couldn't even see that they were being shallow and stupid over getting abortions! How can they possibly cope in a workforce? it allows sexism to creep in because your message is  - women are stupid and shallow and we need to tell them this because they're too stupid to notice it.\n\nthe second thing it does is drive abortions 'underground'. You mention the drug war stuff and how people now have a view of drug users - this hasn't really helped drug users get help has it? yes now we all hate the stereotypical junkie - but the problem remains and is possibly more toxic because we shame these people more than we offer help. The same thing will happen - back alley abortions, pregnancies kept secret and the children abandoned in dustbins. if we're shaming abortions, we're sort of also shaming unwanted pregnancies, not everyone will feel able to access the adoption system much like not all drug users can get into rehab right now. And because the pregnancy/drug use is shamed, the act of getting the help (adoption/rehab) is also kind of shameful.\n\nWe also have the issue that there are too many children in the adoption circuits anyway and there is loads of stuff that children in foster care just don't do as well as children raised by their families, so the woman is still making a choice to make the child's life worse for her convenience. If we follow your logic it wouldn't be long before adoption was banned under most circumstances. Also we don't have the infrastructure for an influx of adopted babies\n\nfinally we'd have the issue of stats. A lot of women who get abortions are either young or old. IE teenagers, or women who thought they had lost fertility through the menopause. These are also the groups who are more at risk during pregnancy. If we essentially remove abortion from the table we're going to get an increase in death and serious complications happening, and increases in infant mortality.\n\nEssentially the PR strategy you describes falls flat really quickly. It's going to be destroyed by a few sob stories. Or it's going to lead us back in time where we just let women stand and look pretty because they're brains aren't that great. And if it does work, it works with very bad consequences including back alley abortions, a lot of shame and increases in birth related complications. Essentially if you do want your goal of trying to stop abortions, this is an awful way to go about it. Maybe a better strategy would be to really, really celebrate adoption. A lot of smiling women handing their babies to smiling families 'i thought i had ruined my life, but instead i made the lives of an entire family perfect' this way it's still the woman's choice - but she's a hero for picking adoption, the shame goes away. it's still not perfect, but i think it's better.

It seems that you've decided that most pro-choice people would discard an argument from the personhood status of the fetus and instead accept an argument from the mother's body autonomy. Presumably this is why you think the most effective campaign would be to attack that argument alone. A quick search didn't turn up any surveys on what pro-choice people think, and I wouldn't trust any national organization such as the Pro Choice Action Network to speak for the closely held beliefs of almost half of the nation.  \n\nThe Supreme Court actually uses both arguments in Roe v. Wade. Here is the personhood section:  \n&gt;This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this \"compelling\" point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State. **With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the \"compelling\" point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.** State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion [p164] during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.  \n\n[source](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113#writing-USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZO)  \n\nThe Supreme Court also interprets the 14th amendment as protecting a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy on the grounds of privacy, which I suppose could be construed as an argument from body autonomy. If pro-choice people base their opinions on the Supreme Court decision, then the most effective campaign would be to attack both body autonomy and the personhood arguments simultaneously, rather than just focusing on the body autonomy argument as you have suggested.

Also, I can't see where you were downgraded to BBB-. In case you can't read it, I'll quote some of the factors they considered:\n\n&gt;The country is a frequent issuer with refinancing needs of more than EUR200 billion in 2012. Although future policy actions within the euro area could reduce investors' concerns and stabilise funding markets, the opposite is also increasingly possible. \n\nSo, your country is constantly refinancing debt and using debt to pay off debt. That's not good. \n\n&gt;As indicated by the A2 rating, the risk of default by Italy remains remote. Nonetheless, Moody's believes that the structural shift in sentiment in the euro area funding market implies increased vulnerability of this country to loss of market access at affordable rates that is incompatible with a 'Aa' rating. Moreover, the preponderance of downside risks and the potential for rapid rating transition which those risks imply are not compatible with a rating at the top end of the 'A' range. \n\nThey state that there is a low risk of default, which is to be expected from most governments. They think there are significant risks so they pushed you out of Aa range, but still, it's a decent rating.\n\n&gt;The Italian economy continues to face significant challenges due to structural economic weaknesses. These problems -- mainly low productivity and important labour and product market rigidities -- have been an impediment to the achievement of higher potential growth rates over the past decade and continue to hinder the economy's recovery from the severe recession it experienced in 2009. \n\nLooks like you're not as productive as you could be and since you aren't growing, you're a riskier investment.\n\nAnd here's the big one:\n\n&gt;Finally, there is increasing uncertainty for the government to achieve fiscal consolidation targets. Since more than half of the consolidation measures are based on government revenue growth, the plans are vulnerable to the high level of uncertainty around economic growth in Italy and elsewhere in the EU. Moreover, political consensus on additional expenditure cuts can be difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the government may find it challenging to generate the primary surpluses that are needed to place the public debt-to-GDP ratio and the interest burden on a solid downward trend. Moody's expects Italy's public debt-to-GDP ratio to reach 120% at the end of this year, up from 104% at the start of the global crisis. As well as posing a risk to Italy's financial strength, which is a key consideration under Moody's sovereign methodology, failure to achieve fiscal and debt targets could increase the country's susceptibility to financial market shocks.\n\n&gt;Also, they don't simply analyze data.\n\nI'm sorry, but they do analyze your data. Here are two articles, [one from Feb 2014](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-changes-outlook-to-stable-on-Italys-Baa2-government-bond--PR_292815) and [the other from Oct 2014](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Italys-accelerated-reform-efforts-and-fiscal-strengths-offset-credit--PR_310496) explaining their methodologies. I don't have the time to do a comparative analysis between Italy and Germany but I will say that Germany is a long-time economic powerhouse in Europe whereas Italy has had plenty of issues. Italy is still be ranked Baa2 which isn't a horrible rating, it just means there's modest risk. On top of that they've got the long term outlook as stable.

Whatever that number is, compare it to how long you think we can sustain an advanced civilization here on Earth without significant investments in Earth. At some point, you have to acknowledge that if we don't take care of our current planet, we might die out before we actually have the technology to leave. In that sense, even if you think we'll *eventually* need to master space travel, that technology is a long term investment, and we're screwed if we don't tend to our current planet long enough for the investment to pay off. So it doesn't necessarily make sense to focus exclusively on space travel.\n\nI'm not personally optimistic that space travel itself will be actually be a great idea in the foreseeable future. But historically, the *pursuit* of such technology has resulted in the development of technology with awesome earth bound applications. So I consider it a great investment even if we never actually leave Earth en masse.

Thus two messed up planets full of people, not a great mars and an empty earth.\ne.g. Those that have the money to go to Mars will go because its better then Earth.

Allocating funds to go to Mars is the best use of that money. I'll tell you why.\n\nPeople think about their immediate needs and concerns. Other people think about their country's population that has poor living standards, or even about the part of humanity that has no access to food, shelter, water, healthcare, etc. We should preserve the Earth, and I obviously agree.\n\nBut although understandable and kind (in the case of people wishing to spend money to make Earth a better place), this is all very short-sighted. It lacks vision and scope at the species level.\n\nIn our immediate future, sure, we need to make sure we can stick around on Earth for as long as possible. So-called \"green\" energy and reducing our emissions is essential if we don't want to destroy ourselves.\n\nBut going to Mars is an excellent first step in mitigating future risks. We'll learn how that planet became the arid desert it is today. We might find extraterrestrial life in the bedrock. There is water to exploit for human exploration there. A small initial colony might turn into a settlement with more and more people, and as the challenges for life there become harder and harder, we'll develop new valuable technology to overcome them, that might benefit humanity as a whole (counting on that pioneer spirit that stimulates human creativity). Keep an open mind on what we could potentially achieve there. We're not talking about building a new high-speed railway line between SF and LA here.\n\n$17 billion to go to Mars is an investment in the future. It might be allocated elsewhere for more immediate benefits, but these benefits will be for comfort and supporting an existing population that is already far too numerous to prevent any damage to the planet. If we never allocate the money needed to make the extra step out of our comfort \"zone\", we might never develop the technology we need to eventually expand our reach to other stars. And I truly feel sorry for people who think this is just science-fiction. Humanity once found ways to domesticate lands. Then to travel quickly over land. Then to cross the oceans to reach new land. Then to fly through the air to move around faster. The next step is to expand across planets and get \"comfortable\" in doing so, the same way we once believed crossing an ocean could never be achieved but we now board a plane to be in a different country in a few hours.\n\nIn short, keeping investments for everything Earth-based only is like owning a beautiful but slowly collapsing house. It's already yours, so the obvious solution is to spend money to maintain and improve it.

Every other interpretation of the word is useless and incoherent, to my mind at least. Let me put it this way: the only way the word \"colour\" has any meaning to a blind man is through its scientific definition. If colour lacked such a definition, the entire concept would be entirely without consequence to him. What constitutes \"meaning\" *does* actually lack a rigorous definition, so if you ever want to have a productive discussion about it with someone who does not already agree with you, you have to come up with one. \n\n&gt; But that doesnt mean wine doesnt exist.\n\nWhich is why I preceded that point with the assumption that some people do find real meaning.

I believe that opposition to this viewpoint is mainly driven by the educational establishment (which has a vested interest in dismissing homeschooling), and by a mainstream culture that a) has difficulty accepting something so unusual and b) is typically presented with only the crazy \"fringe\" of homeschooling.\n\nBefore I present my reasons for believing this, I want to throw out a few caveats:\n\n1) Homeschooling can certainly go wrong, and is a more variable experience. Individual homeschoolers (particularly whose parents have a purely religious reason for homeschooling) will have poor outcomes.\n\n2) While ideal, homeschooling is simply not possible for most families, as it requires significant parental involvement and would be next to impossible to conduct without at least one parent staying home.\n\n----------------\n\n*A note on empirical data*\n\nBefore we begin, there is very little empirical data to support the idea that homeschooling produces any sort of negative outcome, and [most opposition is based on the view that the state, rather than parents, should shape a child's education and ideals](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798508). Until the last 5-10 years, most empirical research that *was* produced was [either small scale, or funded by homeschooling advocates.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798516) However, as [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798510] article notes, that's primarily been driven by the fact that educational institutions (which fund almost all educational research) have very little incentive to fund research into a method of education they cannot provide, and therefore have not -- while the smaller scale studies have, despite their funding, been generally rigorous and controlled.\n\n\n*Academic Achievement*\n\nHome schooling lets the teacher focus on the individual student's strengths and weaknesses, tailor their curriculum specifically, move rapidly through the things they pick up quickly, spend more time on the things they pick up slowly, and deeply explore what the student finds interesting. Frankly, for me, college was a startlingly boring experience -- because if I understood the material as a child, I could take a test, get an A, and skip forward to something else.\n\nThe ability to focus on what interests you makes you *like* learning as a child, and not understand why anyone would not -- and that produces students who are curious for life.\n\nLooking at the research, home schooled students unanimously have better educational outcomes ([1](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836), [2](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02732173.2014.895640),[3](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01619560701312996) ), and while the homeschooled is more likely to be white and middle class, race and income had no statistical effect on their outcomes -- the only school environment in which they do not. [1](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893891),[2](https://www.nmu.edu/education/sites/DrupalEducation/files/UserFiles/Moreau_Kathi_MP.pdf)). \n\nParents who homeschool for religious reasons [do have poorer outcomes](http://eus.sagepub.com/content/43/3/339.short) than those who do so for academic reasons, but the [majority do it for academic reasons, and religion is declining as a reason to homeschool](http://eus.sagepub.com/content/37/3/307.short).\n\n*But what about socialization?*\n\nThis question is posed to me in every conversation, and seems to assert that the only way to interact with peers in a class setting. In fact, most homeschooled students [regularly engage with peers and adults outside the home](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836), as there are a massive amount of extracurricular activites and coop classes available to homeschoolers -- and [most home schoolers engage frequently with their peers and adults outside the home.](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836)\n\nIn fact, the key difference is that homeschooled children have *more* agency in who they interact with, and *more* responsibility to act 'grown up'; all of your friendships are voluntary and you can leave any peer group you find toxic or that bullies you, leading to [\"higher quality friendships and better relationships with their parents and other adults. They are happy, optimistic, and satisfied with their lives. Their moral reasoning is at least as advanced as that of other children, and they may be more likely to act unselfishly. As adolescents, they have a strong sense of social responsibility and exhibit less emotional turmoil and problem behaviors than their peers. Those who go on to college are socially involved and open to new experiences. Adults who were homeschooled as children are civically engaged and functioning competently in every way measured so far.\"](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.796825). [Second source](https://www.nmu.edu/education/sites/DrupalEducation/files/UserFiles/Moreau_Kathi_MP.pdf) [Third Source](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02732173.2014.895640)\n\nIn fact, home schooled college students [experience lower rates of depression, similar self esteem, and higher academic success than their traditionally schooled peers.](http://www.biomedsearch.com/article/impact-homeschooling-adjustment-college-students/294895885.html)\n\n*Aren't homeschoolers weird?*\n\nYes, a bit. I tend to think that, in the absence of an environment that constantly enforces stereotypes, homeschoolers tend to be less sterotypical; often, we *are* pretty nerdy, because there's no group of \"cool kids\" that we want to be like -- so if we like trains, we're going to learn all about some goddamn trains. But fundamentally, that's *good*. You can learn to look cool in college, when you're not a needy teenager and you realize how fundamentally unimportant it is.\n\n*Not everyone can homeschool, and not everyone should.*\n\nI'm NOT advocating that every parent homeschool; only those who can afford to invest the time it requires, and who are willing to take the significant financial impact of losing one parent's income.\n\nLikewise, I'm NOT advocating that there be no regulation of homeschooling; I've got no issue with requiring standardized testing to ensure that students are learning, and I've got no issue with requiring periodic medical tests to ensure students are healthy. What I DO have an issue with is governmental control of the curriculum -- if it produces good results (healthy knowledge, reading ability, mathematical skills, etc), then the more variation we have in educational styles, the better.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

My family also was in a co-op with several other families, and the parents who were qualified would teach a subject. For example, one of the moms had her degree in Math. So she taught Algebra 1, geometry and Alg 2. My dad is good at public speaking. My mom loves biology. Although they aren't experts in the field, they were able to help motivate us to learn the material ourselves, and helped when necessary.

Parents may think that the socialization is better, since they can keep a close eye on their children, and ensure interaction only with nice students. But this means their child never interacts with, well... with jerks. Or cheats. Or children from vastly different social spheres.

I'm not sure, but I would not be surprised if that number is in the single digits."}, {"id": "2oei7p", "body": "I was homeschooled K-12, and strongly believe that, done right, home schooling provides a better experience than most mainstream learning environments. I believe that opposition to this viewpoint is mainly driven by the educational establishment (which has a vested interest in dismissing homeschooling), and by a mainstream culture that a) has difficulty accepting something so unusual and b) is typically presented with only the crazy \"fringe\" of homeschooling.\n\nBefore I present my reasons for believing this, I want to throw out a few caveats:\n\n1) Homeschooling can certainly go wrong, and is a more variable experience. Individual homeschoolers (particularly whose parents have a purely religious reason for homeschooling) will have poor outcomes.\n\n2) While ideal, homeschooling is simply not possible for most families, as it requires significant parental involvement and would be next to impossible to conduct without at least one parent staying home.\n\n----------------\n\n*A note on empirical data*\n\nBefore we begin, there is very little empirical data to support the idea that homeschooling produces any sort of negative outcome, and [most opposition is based on the view that the state, rather than parents, should shape a child's education and ideals](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798508). Until the last 5-10 years, most empirical research that *was* produced was [either small scale, or funded by homeschooling advocates.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798516) However, as [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798510] article notes, that's primarily been driven by the fact that educational institutions (which fund almost all educational research) have very little incentive to fund research into a method of education they cannot provide, and therefore have not -- while the smaller scale studies have, despite their funding, been generally rigorous and controlled.\n\n\n*Academic Achievement*\n\nHome schooling lets the teacher focus on the individual student's strengths and weaknesses, tailor their curriculum specifically, move rapidly through the things they pick up quickly, spend more time on the things they pick up slowly, and deeply explore what the student finds interesting. Frankly, for me, college was a startlingly boring experience -- because if I understood the material as a child, I could take a test, get an A, and skip forward to something else.\n\nThe ability to focus on what interests you makes you *like* learning as a child, and not understand why anyone would not -- and that produces students who are curious for life.\n\nLooking at the research, home schooled students unanimously have better educational outcomes ([1](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836), [2](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02732173.2014.895640),[3](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01619560701312996) ), and while the homeschooled is more likely to be white and middle class, race and income had no statistical effect on their outcomes -- the only school environment in which they do not. [1](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893891),[2](https://www.nmu.edu/education/sites/DrupalEducation/files/UserFiles/Moreau_Kathi_MP.pdf)). \n\nParents who homeschool for religious reasons [do have poorer outcomes](http://eus.sagepub.com/content/43/3/339.short) than those who do so for academic reasons, but the [majority do it for academic reasons, and religion is declining as a reason to homeschool](http://eus.sagepub.com/content/37/3/307.short).\n\n*But what about socialization?*\n\nThis question is posed to me in every conversation, and seems to assert that the only way to interact with peers in a class setting. In fact, most homeschooled students [regularly engage with peers and adults outside the home](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836), as there are a massive amount of extracurricular activites and coop classes available to homeschoolers -- and [most home schoolers engage frequently with their peers and adults outside the home.](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836)\n\nIn fact, the key difference is that homeschooled children have *more* agency in who they interact with, and *more* responsibility to act 'grown up'; all of your friendships are voluntary and you can leave any peer group you find toxic or that bullies you, leading to [\"higher quality friendships and better relationships with their parents and other adults. They are happy, optimistic, and satisfied with their lives. Their moral reasoning is at least as advanced as that of other children, and they may be more likely to act unselfishly. As adolescents, they have a strong sense of social responsibility and exhibit less emotional turmoil and problem behaviors than their peers. Those who go on to college are socially involved and open to new experiences.

This would serve to make the marketplace much more competitive, as there would be hundreds of millions of consumers making purchasing choices. The cost of the monthly premiums could be written off by the taxpayer, instead of the employer taking advantage of a big chunk of that tax write-off.

Errrrr no.\n\nSo that's my opinion anyway hehe ;)"}, {"id": "cmmy0rx", "body": "That's interesting. I didn't know that plants that size would fight against unions.\n\nI'd consider myself pretty left-winged on economic matters, and I feel like unions accomplished a lot to give us the world we have today (40 hour work week, paid benefits, safe workplaces), but I also feel that they've overstayed their welcome and effectiveness. I don't really like it when either group (workers or management) gets to take advantage of the other, and some unions have gone too far and made it so that workers pretty much get to do what they want.\n\nI worked at a plant a couple years ago as a non-unionized employee. You're right. It's pretty much impossible to get fired if you're unionized. I have sympathy for employees that aren't that good at their job, but still try and are decent people. However, unions shield employees that are outright mean, disobedient, and stubborn to their managers and everyone around them.\n\nAlso, you're right, it creates a \"brotherhood\" and a \"us vs them\" attitude, which really shouldn't exist. It just leads to a ridiculous amount of antagonism in the workplace (between unionized workers and non-unionized workers), which simply doesn't need to exist.\n\nHonestly, I think a well-enforced and well thought out set of labour laws that apply to any worker can do much better than a union can.\n\n**EDIT:** Also, \"seniority\"? What the fuck? I need to cut a position, but I can't cut based off the relative merits of all the workers, I have to cut based off \"first-in, last-out\"? I need to decide who best to assign a task, and I don't get to pick the person who can better do the task, rather, I have to offer it to the worker with the most \"seniority\"? I know not all unions have such \"seniority\" policies, but to me, the concept just seems ridiculous."}, {"id": "cmmsdrl", "body": "Depends on the industry. To add to your answer ...\n\nFor example, I work in an automotive factory, for one of the Top 3 manufacturers (ranked by volume). Plant is in North America, where many of the competing manufacturers are also present, and most of them are unionized (maybe even all of them within this region, I'm not sure).\n\nThe plant I work at has well in excess of 5,000 employees, and has been in operation for more than 2 decades. We're not unionized. The union has tried multiple times to get in, and fails.\n\nThere are a few reasons this is the case:\n\n1. There's a perception that unions breed &amp; shield lazy workers. When the majority of the employees want to come to work, do their job &amp; do it well, there's a lot of resentment towards the people who are already perceived as lazy. \"Just imagine what he/she would be like if a union got in. Ugh. They'd never get fired\". The people who get frustrated with laziness applaud the company for walking-out the dead weight, and firmly believe that a union will only shield the lazy ones.\n\n2. The company does enough, without a union, to stay competitive with the other manufacturers. Where I work, this is probably the biggest reason people have for voting against union membership. The company makes changes based on what is bargained-for at the competition, usually tweaks it upwards a teensy bit to sweeten the pot, and that's enough. So what will the union be able to do? The union that's trying to get in, is the same union representing the competition. If the competition can't afford the consessions that the union *could* demand from my employer, then there's a perception that the union won't fight to get us anything better than what we have anyway - otherwise, the union would be shooting itself in the foot by pissing off the members that work at the other car companies.\n\n3. This goes along with &amp; expands on your #5. Aside from government, any sort of company-sponsored pension is a mythical unicorn these days. Higher-than-average starting salary + bonuses twice a year + 10+ weeks vacation + free health/dental/etc benefits + guaranteed pre-planned annual pay raises + pension ... all these things are disappearing in most industries. My employer offers all of these things (and much MUCH more) without a union ever having been here. We don't want to be greedy. We want the company to remain competitive and profitable, so that we actually have a pension when we retire. We want the company to keep the factory in North America, because it means we keep our jobs. We don't want anything (or anyone) to come into our house &amp; fuck shit up, and potentially lose *everything* all because some dipshit in a suit decided that the best way to ensure our support is to guarantee that we all get paid $1 more per hour ... he won't be the one who is unemployed if the company decides that the negotiated contract cuts too deep into their margins.\n\n4. I, personally, have never met a pro-union person who I get along with or even *like* that much. There are plenty of them kicking around where I work. In my experience they're always the ones who will eventually get up in your face, ready to have a screaming match to prove that they're a better person because they \"want a union to support our brothers in need\".

It's just an analogy.\n\nI can speculate though because of a few reasons I know:\n\n1. Some employers try very hard to ensure that unions don't happen in their company. This is difficult to do legally. However, Wal-Mart has gone as far as to close stores if there's serious traction toward the store's workers unionizing. \n2. Some companies are just too small and there isn't enough manpower or motive to create a union.\n3. Some jobs are really for the short-term with high turn-over, so there aren't many long-term employees that go through the task of forming a union. Example: Fast-food workers.\n4. Although it's illegal to do so, some workers risk being fired if they attempt to unionize.\n5. Finally, the most common case: in some jobs, particularly with professionals, the work environment, compensation, and benefits are excellent because the company knows this is necessary to hold on to competent professionals/workers.

In companies where each job has very different responsibilities and work conditions individuals are likely to feel that they are better off negotiating for themselves.\n\nJust as there are some bad companies, there have been some bad unions.

This would serve to make the marketplace much more competitive, as there would be hundreds of millions of consumers making purchasing choices. The cost of the monthly premiums could be written off by the taxpayer, instead of the employer taking advantage of a big chunk of that tax write-off. This idea will only work under the condition that the employee is compensated by employer for the full value of the benefits that s/he is no longer receiving, and this is the angle from which I am making my argument, so please consider this when making your argument.\n\nThanks!

Before WWII fringe benefits like health insurance were a rarity. However, due to a number of different factors, inflation increased. The federal government tried to maintain it by instating a wage freeze. The idea was if people had no more money to spend, prices would not rise due to inflation (by classic definition, the increase int he money supply).\n\nOf course, this failed. Businesses wanted to offer more tempting deals to potential employees so they could compete for better employees, but they couldn't increase wages. So what did they do? They started compensating employees indirectly; the most common way was employer sponsored health insurance.\n\nIn 1954, health insurance compensation by employers was deemed nontaxable. It therefore benefits both the employer and the employee to use such compensation packages.\n\nUnfortunately, with 2 parties looking for profit (doctors and health insurance companies) and 2 parties who did not pay the full price of said health expenses (employer and employee) caused health insurance prices to rise. By no means was this the only reason health insurance in the US has become so expensive,  but it has contributed.\n\nThat being said, government, when it steps out of its boundaries and does too much, tends to fuck shit up more than it helps.\n\nPersonally, I think if an employer and an employee agree to do fringe benefits, they should be allowed to do so. I also don't think people should  be penalized for not buying health insurance if they don't want it. \n\nCompromising either of those two things would be a violation of personal liberty. Unfortunately, thanks to The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, liberty has been compromised.\n\nIf you want to increase competition to decrease the cost of health insurance, allow people not to buy health insurance. Obamacare artificially increases demand, which by the laws of economics, drives insurance companies and doctors to increase prices. As heartless as this sounds, if less people bought health insurance (and got sick or died as a result), the prices would decrease for every one else. Supply and demand, that is all.\n\nAlso, state and federal regulation limit the kinds of plans people can buy and from where they can get them. If we get rid of those regulations, less expensive plans could be offered, even if they dished out less benefits. Deregulation the healthcare industry and letting people buy what plans they want would also increase competition, which would in turn drive down prices.\n\n"}, {"id": "2oed8a", "body": "I believe that all types of insurance should be extracted from the \"benefits\" of employment altogether.

Rather they extract money that could be spent on healthcare, and by getting between customers and healthcare providers (approving, denying, rationing care, etc.), they impose a heavy burden in all kinds of ways. Ask any doctor: during the past 30 years, they've had to hire lots of staff just to negotiate repayment and approvals from insurers.\n\nA single payer system, for one example, would be entirely more efficient because it creates a single point of contact for payment, approval, etc. \n\nTL;DR.

It's really a form of socialism.\n\nHealthy people who don't require much in the way of medical services are subsidizing the older, unhealthier folk. The young and healthy put far more money into the system than they get out. It's a raw deal for the young, but since everyone gets old eventually it all evens out.\n\nThis model breaks down if you actually let people choose whether or not they get health insurance. The young and healthy will opt out of the system, and those who are left will have much higher premiums. With higher premiums, now the slightly older and moderately health are on the losing side of the equation and they will opt out as well. Eventually, the premiums will get too expensive for anyone to afford and the system breaks down entirely. This is known as the insurance death spiral.\n\nWe deal with this by insuring large groups of people with a distribution of ages and don't give them the opportunity to opt out. This is why we ended up with employer-based insurance coverage. But wait, you say, I can opt out of my employer's insurance coverage. Well, yes and no. Your employer coverage is partially paid for by you, but the larger part of the premium is paid for by your employer. If you \"opt-out\", you don't have to pay for the employee portion of the coverage, but your employer is still going to pay its part of the premium on your behalf. This is the compromise that allows the system to work.\n\nThe Affordable Health Care Act tries to extend this system to individuals by mandating that everyone have health care coverage.

But the main reason I would say is to take advantage of the law of large numbers. So basically this is the concept that the more risk (employees) you can pool together the more you can spread the risk across several imputes(employees). So if you have a policy and you only have 10 people and you have a claims risk of $100 dollars and fixed cost to administer the insurance of $100 dollars, an insurer will allocate $10 dollars of claim cost to each employee and $10 dollars of admin cost to the employee for a total of $20 per employee. But if you have 100 employees, the fixed cost will actually decrease and the claims cost will go up evenly, so the cost per employees will go down. Say $10 dollars of claims cost again (10x100=$1000), and fixed cost we will say will be $9 dollars for a larger group (so 9x100=$900), for a total of $1900, so $19 per employee. Remember not all insurance is required so having employer provided coverage helps increase the pool of risk the insurers can spread the cost over and make higher amounts of insurance coverage cheaper for the consumer. \n\nAlso, their are administrative advantages like paycheck deductions, etc.. you can offer through an employer that you cannot offer on a direct market basis, etc.."}, {"id": "2oed8a", "body": "I believe that all types of insurance should be extracted from the \"benefits\" of employment altogether.

This idea will only work under the condition that the employee is compensated by employer for the full value of the benefits that s/he is no longer receiving, and this is the angle from which I am making my argument, so please consider this when making your argument.\n\nThanks!

Of course, if your body is so dependent on it that you risk death or actual injury from not weaning yourself off, then by all means, wean yourself off instead of stopping right then and there.

In this case, to not quit.\n\nSecondly, the drugs are using neurochemicals to trick their way into your most basic instincts. Trying to quit a drug is literally as difficult, if not moreso, than trying to eat or breathe as far as your brain is concerned. Have you ever not eaten for a few weeks/months, or not breathed for a few minutes? You can tame that for a bit, but after a while, *every fiber of your being* cries out for air or food, to the point where you will literally kill to get some. And in the cases of food and air, that is a legitimate survival response. That is the danger of addiction: it is fooling your brain into wanting the drugs *more than food or air*. Consider now that your brain is the bit of you that can weigh your choices.\n\nI posit that if you think that being unable to quit addictions cold-turkey is a sign of a weak will, I posit that you should be able to willingly refuse to eat for 2 months, to prove that your will is strong."}]}
