Children becoming addicts goes to the part where you said that people need to make informed choices. You can argue against his point better without using the slippery slope fallacy. Suicide and what you mentioned to counteract that point aren't comparisons.\n\n&gt;For example, take euthanasia. I'm all for it.

Hence, I don't think they should be making that choice.\n\nI agree with your points about proving sanity and all of that for people who want to off themselves if they are terminal. But simply, some people just want to die. It is not that they aren't happy, some can't even see a future for themselves and some simply don't want to have a future. It is too painful for them. But that being said I would implement a system where it isn't just rash decisions.

It's silly to assume that people haven't already taken that road. \n\nThat is really all I have to say. I agree with /u/yougolplex that suicide isn't selfish, but only if it isn't rash and isn't fueled by anger. If the OP reads this I want him to know that it doesn't get better by itself. Seeking help and finding someone you can trust is Step 1. Suicide is about Step 100. It is after you exhaust all of your resources multiple times. It is selfish to commit suicide without thinking about whether or not you are seeing things clearly.

It goes back for generations.  My grandfather committed suicide.  He poured gasoline on himself and set himself on fire.  \n\nMy great-uncle also committed suicide.  \n\nMy aunt attempted suicide just last year, and she very nearly succeeded.  She is very lucky to be alive. \n\nEven my mother has been suicidal, although she has never tried it because she's afraid of dying.  \n\nThis is all due to their depression.  You probably feel hopeless.  I get that.  I mean, I *really fucking get it*.  \n\nDepression is an illness that can be treated.  You have to be headstrong in this battle.  There are tons of viable treatment methods available that can help you.  \n\nTalking won't help.  I get that too.  Talking about how you feel works as well for depression as it would for a bacterial infection.  You can talk about your symptoms all you like but it isn't going to cure you.  \n\nMedication will though.  \n\nDude I know you feel like shit.  I'm sorry you're going through this.  I know your thoughts are clouded and you can't see the potential you have for getting better.\n\nWould you rather have the underlying cause of your desire to die taken away, so that you can live a happy life, or would you rather die feeling miserable?  That's the very premise for wanting to die.  You aren't happy.  You wish you could be happy though.\n\nYou can.  \n\nI have seen so much of what you are going through, and I know words won't cure you.  What I want you to do is go to your psychiatrist (assuming you're seeing one, if not, find one right now) and tell them you're having problems.  A good psychiatrist can and will prescribe medications that will *change your life*.  \n\nI don't know what else to say.  \n\nI get what you're feeling, I get that you feel hopeless/down/distant and maybe guilty, and I know that you probably aren't capable of understanding what I'm telling you.\n\n*but*...  I am someone who has witnessed great change in my family.  My mother is a functioning adult with a good paying job who is mostly happy in her life. \n\nMy aunt, who attempted suicide just last year due to her depression, is now happily married and doing well...  *because we forced her to see a psychiatrist*.  You may not believe me, but you can be helped.  It's very simple.  \n\nOn that day you don't feel like getting up, get up anyway and go see the doctor.  \n\n"}, {"id": "2osz8g", "body": "That's people's favorite counter to suicide - it's so selfish.

She cannot describe who she is, or what she does, or what the point of her life is without referencing her role as a mother to this son.  If he commits suicide then he is killing her identity as well.  His mother is not sad just because she feels bad for him or for herself, but because she feels sad that their bond, the most basic part of who she was, has been destroyed against her will.

This means I do not believe in free will. However, I also don't believe that anyone is destined to kill themselves. Suicide is the one choice we have as human beings. Who are we to fault those who choose to end their own lives? Who are we to fault those that take advantage of the one true choice we have? I find it incredibly rude. \n\nBut just because a person chooses their fate to die does not mean it was meant to be that way. People are all born happy. We are all destined to live happily. Hardships will always happen. Pain will always happen. But in the end happiness and love will always win out. \n\nThings may seem bad now, but remember your depression does not define you. Wanting to die does not define you. You are not that person. You are a person who was born happy and is destined to be happy. Think of yourself as a baby or as a small child. When you were unequivocally you down to your very core. Remember how happy you were? Remember how wondrous everything used to be? \n\nThat person is still inside of you. A lot has changed. Maybe a lot of sadness and pain has crept into your life.  But you are still unequivocally you down to your very core. You just need to find him/her again. \n\nI lost my boyfriend to suicide about a year after we started dating. He was my first love. I had never loved anybody like I had loved him. The day he went missing and the morning I found out he shot himself in the heart were surreal. I've never felt such pain. About a month after my boyfriend died my grandfather also shot himself. I was numb at that point. I didn't know how to handle the grief. I fell into a very intense suicidal depression. With every new situation I was in I would think about how I could kill myself. I genuinely wanted to die. \n\nThe scariest part wasn't how willing I was to die. The scariest part was when I realized that I had become a different person. I didn't know how to find myself. It took me a year to pull myself out of the darkness and the fear. When I was finally better, when I finally remembered how to be happy, when I was unequivocally myself again I realized just how beautifully alive I was. I realized how desperately I wanted to live. I realized that I am and everyone else, including you, are destined to be happy and live long and happy lives. \n\nUnfortunately I cannot change your view on suicide because I agree with you. I don't think it's selfish in the slightest. I think labeling suicide as selfish is a really fucked up thing to do. I will defend my loved ones' choices to my own grave. \n\nBut I do disagree with suicide simply because I don't believe it to be the right choice. Nothing is permanent. It's hard to see now. It's hard to stay positive. But if you can just put off killing yourself I think you'll one day find that you're actually better. You won't have to remind yourself to live because you're already living. It's the most natural thing in the world a person can do. \n\nFor the record, if you're contemplating suicide at all I strongly recommend counseling. It saved my life. If you're posting here already that means you want to live and want help. Go easy on yourself. Don't bully yourself for not being able to get up and be productive. Start out small. Read children's chapter books. When You Reach Me is a great one. Express yourself through any sort of medium you find interesting. Go to therapy and talk about it. Congratulate yourself when you're able to get up and take a shower. Remind yourself of the people who love you. Sing it as a mantra every night before you go to sleep. My aunt taught me that. \"Mom loves me. Dad loves me. My sisters love me. Grandma loves me.\" I'd list off all the people I could think of that love me every night before I went to sleep. \n\nEventually you don't have to try as hard because living will once again come more naturally.

The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront. Of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act. There often are for rape, and there almost always are for dynamite. But if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer's suicidal automatic machines.

I totally agree that people should be able to do what they want with their own body but with a clear mind making a decision like that caught in the clutches of depression is not a good idea and if people dont do it because its considered selfish in my books it would be selfish not to consider it selfish as people ochre kill themselves"}, {"id": "2osz8g", "body": "That's people's favorite counter to suicide - it's so selfish.

However, this logic is incorrect -- both parties can be selfish simultaneously.\n\nI believe that suicide can be selfish or unselfish, depending on the reason for the suicide:\n\n1. There are situations in which terminally ill or severely disabled individuals might commit suicide in order o spare their loved ones from the burden of caring for them or from the pain of watching them slowly waste away. In this case, suicide is not selfish because it is performed out of concern for others rather than concern for oneself.\n\n2. Another situation, and the one I believe most people have discussed here, is that suicide is performed in order to escape personal struggles (e.g. Depression). In these cases, suicide is selfish because the motivation weights the individual's personal issues more than the inevitable issues that while arise for loved ones following the suicide. \nWhen I say that this form of suicide is selfish, I do not mean to say that it is inherently bad or that it is never the proper course of action. Whether or not suicide is right for you depends on your own personal philosophy. If you believe that the good of others is more important than your own (or that there are specific individuals whose good supercedes your own[e.g. Your children]), then suicide to escape your own issues is wrong for you so long as it will harm others. If you believe that your only duty is to yourself and your own happiness (like myself), then suicide is the proper course of action if you believe that your life is so terrible that non-existence would be preferable."}, {"id": "2osz8g", "body": "That's people's favorite counter to suicide - it's so selfish.

I don't think it should be too hard to conceive of such a situation -- if if a bit unlikely or absurd. \n\n&gt; It's that person's life, they can do what they want with it.\n\nThis is largely irrelevant and doesn't necessarily support your point.  You can do what you want with lots of things -- whether they are yours or not.  That doesn't mean that what you choose to do with these things can't express selfishness.  \n\nThe issue isn't whether or not any particular act of suicide is selfish or not, almost innately it is something self-serving.  But the more pertinent question is how your suicide would effect others -- which may or may not be in their best interests.   A suicide undertaken in an effort to help people -- perhaps to provide them with insurance money or to raise awareness of their plight -- would arguably be different than a suicide undertaken which would have negative repercussions for people (for example, if a single parent committed suicide even though no one would provide for their family in their absence).\n\nAlso... I think it's probably worth pointing out that situations sometimes change and become more tolerable -- or even good.  And suicide is something which is, arguably, often undertaken with too much haste and without broader consideration of how suddenly and completely a person's situation can change.  It is, arguably, that irrational lack of insight which makes depression qualify as a psychological disorders.  People can survive in concentration camps and as slaves.  People can survive war zones for years without killing themselves.

You never actually gave a reason why killing yourself was not selfish. All you said was that \"It's that person's life, they can do what they want with it.\" That doesn't make it less selfish. For a comparative lets talk about a husband and father running away from his family. Your logic should apply here. He is not causing anyone any more harm than someone who kills themselves, but by leaving his family alone he is being selfish. He disregards what will happen to anyone other than himself when he leaves. Just because the people getting hurt by him leaving are worried about what will happen to themselves when he is gone doesn't make his leaving any less selfish.\n\nI think the point you are making is more that it is justifiably selfish. To this I have only one argument. Depression is a disease that affects how you think. Making any decisions while in a depressed state is equivilent to making a decision while impared by drugs or alcohol. If you are dying inside than the depression is making decisions for you. Suicide is a one way trip, it isn't something you can take back, so in making a decision like that you should not be impared by anything, be it a disease, alcohol, or anything ells.

While we can talk about the triple amputee with an inoperable tumor in the brain, most cases aren't like that. I do think there is a difference between euthanasia (even self-euthanasia) and suicide, so I want to define that for the sake of argument. Euthanasia seems to be the result of a long=lasting disease that was treated without effect that will cripple the person for the rest of their life, often the rest of their life will be extremely short. For example: after round 4 with cancer, the patient decides to call it quits and intentionally overdoses. Suicide often comes from a person with a strictly mental illness decides to end their life based on the belief that the future will be lousy. There's a key difference there and it is treatment. Euthanasia comes when all practical treatment options have been exhausted and there is literally 0 hope for improvement by any uninvolved party. Suicide often happens when options haven't been *fully* explored.\n\nThe problem with suicide is that it is extremely selfish, imho. There are a few reasons for this.\n\nOften times, the suicidal believe that their death won't hurt anyone. However, they never discuss it seriously with friends/family. If they are *truly* unloved, there's no harm in saying \"Hey Mom, I'm in a lot of pain right now and need to discuss my options with you.\" Instead they never give their friends/family the chance to say \"No, I don't think that's a good option, what about [blank].\" It takes a certain self-centered outlook to say 'I know and therefore I don't have to ask/confirm.'\n\nIt is often a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I know that it's not always easy to see a light at the end of the tunnel. However, there are things you can do to approach this in a far manner. You owe yourself the best shot at life you can get. Set a date a year or two plus in the future. A year isn't so long. You can try different solutions and things may honestly change in a year's time. However, if you don't you're robbing yourself of everything you wanted to do. Hell, maybe you just wanted to take a trip to France: do that in that year so that you know that trip wasn't going to change your life. Give it the best shot you have even if you go home every night and count the days to your suicide date. If you miss it, obviously things are not as horrible as they seem. If you get to the date, you can honestly say that you tried the treatment and you tried waiting to see if you could see a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nTake a look at suicide like losing a limb. I draw, I'd be devastated if I lost my right hand. If I got a hook, I wouldn't be very good with it. If I used my left hand, I'd still suck. I wouldn't see the light and I don't think you could blame me: I lost 15 years of hard work and dedication. However, wouldn't it be worse for me if I gave up and killed myself before even really *trying* with my hook, left hand, etc.? It wasn't that my problem was insurmountable, I was just so focused on how much I *didn't* have and what I lost that I lost sight of my possibilities. I stole that future where I was painting with my hook away from myself. And really? That one year when I focused on my hook would probably be enough to get me over the hump (so to speak). I threw away the rest of my life because I couldn't spend one year trying to learn with my hook.\n\nSo basically, make sure it really is beyond hope. It is selfish to A - assme how other people will feel about you if you feel unloved and B - steal your future from yourself. Take a year, seriously explore *all* treatment options, whether they be travel, psychological/psychiatric help, doing things with people, etc. However, you must aggressively treat it for that year or two. You owe it to yourself, or if it's not working you owe yourself that trip to France (or wherever)."}, {"id": "2osz8g", "body": "That's people's favorite counter to suicide - it's so selfish.

I think that institutions and political efforts that act for the benefit of a specific race or for the promotion of so called 'diversity' are inherently racist and reinforcing the problem. I **understand** what institutionalized racism is and how our cultures stereotypes can make it difficult for people of certain backgrounds to change the stereotypes in the first place (i.e. a self-fulfilling prophecy)\n\nYet, I agree with Ron Paul in that ending these stereotypes is not a matter of actively promoting diversity or mandating changes to our system. Instead, I believe that we have to provide absolutely equal opportunities to everyone regardless of race, stop asking for it in the paperwork and stop teaching the racial stereotypes to our youth. In short, I think we have to stop caring about race to stop caring about race.\n\nIt seems that any opinion I hold is discounted by *my* race, because I can't possibly understand the struggles of minorities, which I find quite ironic as white *is* a minority in my town. This fact seems to distract every argument and I never get a reasonable response, so please CMV!\n\n**EDIT:** I've read through everyone's comments and appreciate the discussion. Perhaps I need to clarify because the title doesn't directly assert my main opinion, but I certainly have a deeper understanding of the problem now. I don't disagree that racism exists, I don't disagree that it should be changed, and I don't disagree that people should be aware of it existing...instead I believe that promoting the pride of racial identities and the organizations which help to unite such groups are promoting the continuance of racism. I understand that, much like unions form to give workers a say who would otherwise have no bargaining power, these minority groups and identity groups exist to make their voice heard and have, in the past, made huge changes to the law. However, culturally, these united groups will only continue racism, because you can't rule over people's attitudes.

Because people feel like they \"shouldn't\" notice race, but instead what it does is stigmatize race. By getting comfortable enough with racial characteristics where they truly are just a physical description, saying someone has darker skin should be exactly the same as saying they have darker hair. The only reason why someone shouldn't want to say it is if they feel there is something negative about it, which is where the true problem lies.

Racism is not the ONLY cause of income disparity, but it is one of them, just like a runny nose is caused by a cold, the flu, or crying- and in the same way that you might have multiple diseases at once, one might be black, poorly educated, AND come from a family situation that isn't conducive to success- all contributing to poverty. \n\n Proving that income disparity is the root cause and unrelated to race by pointing to rich people of color and poor white people is like trying to prove global warming is false by pointing to south Florida in the winter- just because it isn't true EVERYWHERE doesn't invalidate the trend.\n\nHow is it to be changed? Addressing ALL causes of income disparity. Making sure ALL schools are as good as we can make them. Making sure employment is fair. Supporting kids when their parents have made decisions or suffer circumstances that hurt their potential. \n\nIn order, I just pointed to good education policy, affirmative action, and welfare. \n\nAlso, the toy metaphor is apt. Let's explore it just a bit more:\n\nIf one kid has all the toys and cries when a parent forces them share, the ridiculousness is clear- we expect the child to get over it. What about when the kid hoards 70% of the toys? They aren't making a clear play to control the toys, but they are-intentionally or not- using more of the toys than the other kids. It probably seems a bit more malicious if a parent scolds a child over controlling 20% more of the toys than they should, but in this clean cut mental exercise, we see that the parent is justified. \n\nWhat if it's 51%? A parent scolding a child over taking 1% more of the toys than they should sounds mean, but ethically, it's the right thing to do. \n\nMy point is this: we look at lynchings, and we have reached a broad concensus that it was wrong, and it was right for the government to step in. We look at segregation, and it's the same- clearly wrong, clearly good for the government to step in- but it was muddied for a while by separate but equal. \n\nBut now (and I'm ABSOLUTELY NOT SAYING THAT WE ARE THIS CLOSE TO RACIAL EQUALITY) that the moral lines are less clear, that the problem isn't of life or liberty to the common white perspective, it's like we're at 51%- it's harder to see the good that is being done over the pain of being scolded. It's easier to feel that we have EARNED that extra one percent, that extra pay, that extra confidence with police, that extra trust from people on the street, that extra credibility from juries. \n\nNone of these seem like a big deal to one person at one time, and it's easy to blame government intrusion for any number of things. It's easy to feel blamed for being white when hearing about racism. But remember that the extra pay is 20% or more for the same work, that extra confidence from the police is probably the root cause of Michael Brown's death, that extra credibility from juries is the reason more black men are on death row than should be.

That is bold, and I hope that he does not really mean that.  And the antidote to racism is liberty? I do not know what he means, liberty is an idea.

Well, if a majority of people are 'color-blind' (or at least they think they are), then they would not see any existing racism being perpetuated by the minority that clings to their old ideals (much like what we see today). This means that you are more likely to dismiss the experience of a minority pointing out racism because of color-blind ideology on the basis that you believe this racism would end if they just didn't bring it up so often.  \n\nBut that's not how it works. Not bringing up racial discrimination doesn't make it go away, just like ignoring sexual harassment in the workplace doesn't make it go away.

The result is that black people tend to have mostly or exclusively black friends, Latinos are friends with Latinos, Asians are friends with asians, and, most importantly, whites, the people with all of the power, are friends with whites. \n\nIf I understand correctly, when we say \"end racism,\" we mean \"have everyone treated as equal, regardless of race,\" and to be honest, that will be impossible so long as people segregate and self-segregate along racial lines. The fact of the matter is that most people are comfortable with what is familiar (which is probably a large contributor to self-segregation), so if I grew up around only white people, then I will be most comfortable around only white people, and I will be suspicious of all other people. This also work in the other direction: if I've only ever been friends with black people, then I'll be comfortable around only black people and suspicious of all other groups. This is true of babies, it's true of children, and it's true of adults. I believe it is impossible (regardless of effort) to treat people that we are comfortable with the same way as we treat people we are uncomfortable with. The results is that the majority of white people are incapable of treating black people the way they treat white people, the majority of black people are incapable of treating white people the way they treat black people, and so on. This means that the only way for racism to disappear is for all races to become comfortable with one another, and I believe that the only way to achieve that is intermixing, which is not happening with the current system of clustering into groups of familiar people for protection (this occurs even in the most liberal of institutions -- I go to Columbia University, one of the most diverse universities in the country, and a very liberal one, and people still show up and immediate choose the groups they want to be a part of based on race). \n\nI think that the only way for racism to be eradicated is for minorities to step out of their comfort zone and start involving themselves in activities with the groups they are least comfortable with and that are least comfortable with them. Groups that are formed on the basis of racial divides need to be broken up to the greatest degree possible, so that when they need to find friends, people will not have a place to run and hide for what's uncomfortable -- they will instead be forced to become comfortable with what is uncomfortable. I believe that there was a time for hide i groups for protection when black people got lynched for coming too close to white girls. However, in this day and age, racism is almost universally  frowned upon: people try not to be racist as much as possible, so I don't think sticking together for protection is benefitting minorities anymore -- it's holding them back by not giving people the opportunity to become comfortable with one another.\n\nBefore I get asked why minorities should be doing the reaching out rather than white people, it is a matter of practicality. White people have the least to gain from this, so they have the least incentive to reach out. Minorities, on the other hand, have a lot to gain from reaching out, so it seems to me that minorities are the most likely to willingly leave their comfort zones in order to achieve that gain."}, {"id": "2osnqc", "body": "To elaborate, I was in an argument over at /r/libertarian over a [quote from Ron Paul](http://i.imgur.com/2IBCRuv.jpg) that was getting a lot of flak.

The people who ascribe to these beliefs have their hearts in the right place but may be unknowingly working on assumptions that are harmful.\n\nConcerning your example, there is a belief common on the left that opinions must be informed by lived-experience. OK, I get the motivation for that. To walk a mile in someone's shoes, sure. Where it gets uncomfortably close to racism however is that it places increased or decreased value on someone's opinions based upon their race. \n\nNow, I'm a humanist. I believe that all humans have incredible potential for rational thought and, far more importantly, incredible empathy. We can empathize with the plights of another human very effectively, especially because all humans likely experience emotions related alienation, exclusion, injustice, etc. Even white men.\n\nThus, I make it a strict policy to judge a person's beliefs based ONLY upon the reasoning that they have used. Never will I give extra credit to ANYONE based upon something like race or sex. Just as I don't believe that any 'type' of person has a monopoly on understanding mathematics, I don't believe that any 'type' of person has a monopoly on understanding oppression. To behave differently, even when the motivations are reasonable, I feel is harmful and dehumanizing. \n\nBeyond that, it takes people out of the conversation, which is the opposite of what we want.

Perhaps I need to clarify because the title doesn't directly assert my main opinion, but I certainly have a deeper understanding of the problem now. I don't disagree that racism exists, I don't disagree that it should be changed, and I don't disagree that people should be aware of it existing...instead I believe that promoting the pride of racial identities and the organizations which help to unite such groups are promoting the continuance of racism. I understand that, much like unions form to give workers a say who would otherwise have no bargaining power, these minority groups and identity groups exist to make their voice heard and have, in the past, made huge changes to the law. However, culturally, these united groups will only continue racism, because you can't rule over people's attitudes. Thank you for reading and I encourage anybody to continue the discussion.\n"}, {"id": "cmq8csd", "body": "Partially I agree with you, partially I don't.\n\nI don't think the solution is to stop talking about race.  For one it's a completely unworkable solution.  For two, it'll do little to address the underlying attitudes.  \n\nThe problem comes in about how we talk about race.  Many white people, rightly or wrongly, feel like they're being attacked when people talk of white privilege, and no one likes to be blamed for the actions of people in the past they happen to share a phonological similarity to.  The way many talk about race reinforces an us vs them mentality.\n\nA lot of the problem comes down to a lack of empathy.  Lots of people talk, but don't feel heard.  Lots of people talk, but only to people who already agree with them.  And often when people talk to people who don't agree, they talk in anger.\n\nI find there are a lot of racists of all colors.  When someone tells me I believe something or am the way I am because of the color of my skin and my particular ancestry, it's a racist remark.  \n\nIn short, we need to be more civil to each other, and try to understand how and why people feel.  I know a lot of black people who feel very marginalized and under siege by society.  I know a lot of white people who feel they can't openly express themselves on matters of race without being called racist.  Once we begin to do that, we can begin the process of finding common ground.  The truth is, there's a lot of common ground.

If the US happened to help out a bit fine, and if it didn't fine, but the Iraqi government would stand on its own.

Help, not cause.\n\nThe drastic drop in oil prices and the rebirth of American oil production, on the other hand, is primarily a function of technological advance with a side of (mostly Saudi-driven) geopolitics, taking the ball out of the President's court on that one.\n\nGay marriage and marijuana legalization have been issues brewing for a very long time across the country, and while Obama has been somewhat supportive, he's hardly the prime mover.\n\nForeign policy is unambiguously the domain of the President, and there the record is mixed, too.  The death of Bin Laden and the neutering of Al-Qaeda worldwide is a a signal and smashing success of the Obama Administration, if one achieved by sometimes-controversial means.  America -did- draw down and end combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but only to see Iraq drawn into much deeper turmoil and Afghanistan facing the specter of potential further bloodshed.

You presented a solution: make things safer for funeral processions and drivers through education like we did with railroad crossings.\n\n\nI think we need to weigh the cost of educating or redesign against the benefits of the processions.\n\nSure, we could still allow people to fire guns off in celebration if we educated everyone on gun safety and cleared all areas of civilians when the guns go off.  We could also design and erect portable shields to allow people to fire willy-nilly.\n\nObviously that's absurd, but I do think that railroad crossings have a more vital impact and service than funeral processions, and the cost of restructuring crossings or railroads themselves is far greater than the cost of prohibiting a funeral processions (or any private procession on open, public roads).\n\nTo change my view, I think you'd have to demonstrate that the value of funeral processions taking place on open public roads outweighs the risk of processions on open roads, or that funeral processions are of such vital importance as to justify the risk.\n\n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2osb8h", "body": "My point is, only now, we with all this technology we can save SOME of the people that take the decision of taking their own life, and while we do it, we negate the message they tried to express while \"living that experience\".  \n\nOf course they would be in a different state of mind, shortly after being saved from death, after receiving attention, and being taken seriously.  \n\nAnd its easier for society to handle a failed suicide, rather than a succesfull suicide with proper reasons. \n\nWe all take life changing decisions, even ireversible ones, and we consider \"free will\" as the reason for taking them.

So I am a firm believer in cultural relativism, that you can not judge a culture base off of morals or societal norms you gained from your own culture. So we have example one, that being gay is okay because we have seen it throughout history in many different cultures, the Greeks being a prime example. However they also were constant offenders of pedophilia, forcing twelve year old boys to give oral sex to grown men. We bring up pacific island cultures, that idolize drag queens and transgenders, however there are also cultures where the women teach the 9 year old boys how to have sex. How can the first be okay but not the second. They are both acceptable in their respective cultures just one is deemed disgusting in our culture. We bring up animals, point out how so many different species have gay relationships, but animals also start having sex as soon as they are able to produce babies, which is like twelve for us. Being gay is natural, being a pedophile is natural, we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the \"norm\" but are widely accepted in many cultures. However, westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic Christians what they think about gay people, they say it's disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad, I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia, when in truth they are very much alike. \n\nBefore I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester, I figured I'd state my views. I am in full support of the gay community, I have a gay sister that I love very dearly. I am in noway condoning or promoting pedophilia I too find it disgusting and wrong but understand that that viewpoint is a product of the society I grew up in.  \n\nEdit: view has been changed, giving credit to /u/terribleusername. He argued with the idea of cultural relativism in mind. Not blindly calling pedophilia rape because kids cannot give consent. As I argued with many of you the consent line we draw is arbitrary. Others seemed to just be arguing on the premise that being a pedophile is bad, when my view was that it is related to being gay regardless of right and wrong. Everything seemed to opinion based. Like it causes harm, which I understand is by our standards wrong, but is still an opinion. Whats the correct age of consent, all still opinion and too loosely defined for my liking, to actually change my view. However /u/terribleusername pointed out that the difference would be that every culture has a cultural line for it. The fact that every culture must make a different line for the age of consent makes it a bit different from homosexuality. I know I argued consent with a lot of people, but the point is that we or even culture have to question consent, it makes it a little different from being gay. Although I still find them related, not nearly as closely than when I first began.                  \n\nP.S. apologize for the hurt feeling, I understand I could have worded the title a little bit better.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That's the core of what my position (and sense of morality) is about, that humans are uniquely able to recognize their actions and understand that they should not do something to others that they would not be OK with having done to themselves. We're self aware, recognize that we exist as a physical body, but also as a consciousness. Other animals feel pain or aggression, but they aren't consciously aware of it, it's an instinctual response. Most importantly, other animals don't have the consciousness which means they don't recognize that other animals would have it too. While human pain is subjective, the fact that humans are conscious and consciously *suffer* isn't.\n\nI'm not religious, but it's a little like the concept of a human soul but in a secular and more scientific sense. We know there is a difference between human cognition and an animal's. We all implicitly understand this, I have no reason to point a gun at you because I know you have no reason to point one at me, and I *understand* that pointing a gun at you is wrong because you are a conscious being who will be aware of what I'm doing. When someone either through action or words demonstrate that they don't understand this concept, it means they don't uphold the reciprocal nature of how these rights work. There's no objective way to deem one human's existence more valuable than another, so these rights must be equal and reciprocal. \n\nIf you pointed a gun at me, I (or a third party) would be justified to shoot you because through your actions you've implicitly shown you don't respect my right to life. If you lock me in a cage for no reason, you've demonstrated you don't respect my freedom which arises from my right to self, and I or a third party would be justified to use force to get me out of the cage. That's what justifies imprisonment, you can only be justly imprisoned if you demonstrate you don't respect the rights of others. The response needs to be proportional, if someone lightly pushes me I'm not justified to slug them in the face, and if someone steals $20 I can't shoot them to get it back, because that's a disproportionate (and thus not reciprocal) response.\n\nThe death penalty is another can of worms, I'd consider the death penalty just under the same logic as above with self defense, if you murder someone you don't recognize their right to life and thus have forfeited yours, and whether or not you're executed or killed by someone defending themselves the end result is the same, you've disregarded another's right to life, and rendered yours forfeit. That being said, it's one of those things where a practical application is hard. Personally I believe the death penalty is justified in principle if you've either taken or made an attempt on someone's life, but I don't support it as a policy because of the chance an innocent person would be executed. \n"}, {"id": "2orvv0", "body": "I know this is a widely hated view in the gay community however, I just can't help seeing the truth in it.

However, the main consideration, and why pedophilia is taboo, is the psychological effects. Just because someone is physically ready for sex, doesn't mean they are mentally ready. Every person is mentally ready at a different point in their life - some before they are physically ready and others not until a decade later or more. However, from a legal standpoint, it's impractical to evaluate every single person on a case-by-case basis, so we decide on a cutoff age for giving consent. As a society, we figure that by that age, most people are old enough to understand what they're giving consent to. In a societal sense, rather than a legal one, we do something similarly, but without a hard-set age. We know 8 is too young, and 18 is probably too old, but what about 14? 16?

Being gay is natural, being a pedophile is natural, we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the \"norm\" but are widely accepted in many cultures. However, westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic Christians what they think about gay people, they say it's disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad, I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia, when in truth they are very much alike. \n\nBefore I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester, I figured I'd state my views. I am in full support of the gay community, I have a gay sister that I love very dearly. I am in noway condoning or promoting pedophilia I too find it disgusting and wrong but understand that that viewpoint is a product of the society I grew up in.  \n\nEdit: view has been changed, giving credit to /u/terribleusername. He argued with the idea of cultural relativism in mind. Not blindly calling pedophilia rape because kids cannot give consent. As I argued with many of you the consent line we draw is arbitrary. Others seemed to just be arguing on the premise that being a pedophile is bad, when my view was that it is related to being gay regardless of right and wrong. Everything seemed to opinion based. Like it causes harm, which I understand is by our standards wrong, but is still an opinion. Whats the correct age of consent, all still opinion and too loosely defined for my liking, to actually change my view. However /u/terribleusername pointed out that the difference would be that every culture has a cultural line for it. The fact that every culture must make a different line for the age of consent makes it a bit different from homosexuality. I know I argued consent with a lot of people, but the point is that we or even culture have to question consent, it makes it a little different from being gay. Although I still find them related, not nearly as closely than when I first began.                  \n\nP.S. apologize for the hurt feeling, I understand I could have worded the title a little bit better.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

After my understanding, a lot of influental people adviced him not to invade Russia, and he responded with exiling them. \n\nRelevant question, how did it affect the citizens when he started losing the war?"}, {"id": "cmr4c4g", "body": "Okay, this will go question by question so you it'll be easier to understand instead of a very compounded paragraph answering multiple questions.\n\n1. Yes, Napoleon did get eager and perhaps warmongering as he fought, and won, more and more. As has been argued by his detractors this certainly hurt France. His detractors, however, ignore the fact that outside of his invasion of Spain every single other major power had set themselves against France and for the most part even after being soundly beaten. Remember that Napoleon was not a member of the true aristocracy of kings and was a low born noble that had risen to that station. At no point did any nation consider a lasting peace with him possible because they all refused to believe it could be maintained. Thus, while Napoleon is certainly to blame for his warmongering the same thing could be argued of his contemporaries and while France suffered when he lost it prospered financially when he won and he won a lot.\n\n2. I would disagree mostly because you're confusing selfishness with arrogance. He was undoubtedly selfish in many ways, but that wasn't the motivating factor behind his invasion of Russia. To my knowledge and having studied the man extensively, he never stopped caring for the people of France. His motivations, and that is what you are asking for here, are up to a great deal of debate and his detractors will argue the exact opposite of what his apologists will. However, what was good for France and what was good for Napoleon often times coincided, Russia and Spain are two exceptions to this. Yet every leader makes mistakes, Napoleon's intent was never to get beaten and lose 500,000 men. The fact that the winter was cold and bitter even by Russian standards and his supply lines were overstretched could be seen as oversights. On the other hand Napoleon had done what he had wanted which was defeat the Russian army (twice) and capture Moscow. The miscalculation on his part was to believe that Alexander would sue for peace after that loss and he refused. Did he miscalculate, yes, on the other hand it was surprising to most everyone that Alexander refused to bargain even the British were surprised.\n\n3. An exceptional leader, one who is supremely gifted and prepared cannot see every eventuality. That is the nature of a fluid thing like warfare which relies on innumerable variables. Now, for a moment imagine the problem x+1=y, but given the value of neither x or y how do you solve it. You could create any number of solutions to this problem, but that hardly guarantees that you have the specific solution you need because there are an infinite number of solutions to this problem. This is warfare, an infinite number of possible solutions, but only a few could be correct and likely only one is the proper answer to the question presented. To criticize Napoleon for failing to be adequately prepared for something as dynamic and prone to change as warfare would be to criticize every great leader in the course of human history. \n\n4. He was advised by nearly all his generals not to invade Russia, he exiled none of them, though he was none to pleased by their hesitance. His decision to invade was a unilateral one brought on by hubris, ego, and arrogance of the extreme given that in the few battles he had faced the Russians (exempting Eylau) he had wiped the floor with them and their armies. Yes, it was a mistake, however it was a mistake that given other circumstances might have proved fortuitously beneficial. The decision to invade and the retreat were disasters, but the campaign itself marred as it was by mental errors, sloppy and indecisive decision making, and an ill Napoleon still came within a hairsbreadth of crushing the Russian army not once, but twice.\n\n5. France was an economic and physical wreck at the end of two decades of sustained warfare. The loss of hundreds of thousands of men cannot be understated and much of Europe was similarly devastated. To put it in perspective between the 16th and early 19th century Europe had known less than 50 years of peace. The next major war fought by European powers wouldn't be for another 40 and the next major war fought on continental Europe wouldn't be until 1870. That was how psychologically devastating the French revolution and Napoleonic wars were. How the individual citizen started to suffer is a little bit more difficult to glean. There were likely food shortages as Napoleon lost his grip on power. The Bourbon restoration saw the revoking of a lot of Napoleon's more liberal policies and a return to the French monarchical dominance on freedoms. So in that sense his fall was a large reason that the French peasant suffered and his return (briefly) which led to an almost overnight revolution evidence of how hated the Bourbons were and how beloved Napoleon was."}, {"id": "2orvjp", "body": "Of course, Napoleon did many things for france, it's infrastructure, economy, laws and in general frances future, but it seems like he did nothing for the people as individuals and was in general a douche bag to most people?

Even though Andrew talked about the positive sides - what he did to france as a country, it still seems like he did nothing much for individuals living in france back then.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I do not represent GM in any way. \n\nI believe that the Chevy Volt is the best car that money can buy at the moment. For those unfamiliar, the Volt is an extended range electric vehicle - it operates fully on electricity, and switches over to a gas-powered generator when the charge is depleted. It can be charged in any standard power outlet, and works with higher voltage car charging equipment. \n\nChevy has done a TERRIBLE job marketing this car. Every day, I find myself having to deal with the same myths and fears coming from people who are unfamiliar with it. Some of the things i get are:\n\n*  When you run out of battery, you're screwed! (The Volt has a 9 gallon gas tank)\n* Those things catch fire all the time! (This happened once in a crash test, traditional gas-engine cars ignite more often than electric)\n* Your electricity goes through the roof! (it costs me less than $20/month to charge the car at home)\n* Electric cars are only for rich people! (I've seen some leases starting at $199/month)\n* It's expensive to maintain! \n* Obama forced GM to build this! (It was first developed in 2006 and the EV tax credits were put in place by George W. Bush)\n\nIt's a very acclaimed car - it's won the most prestigious industry awards, including Motor Trend Car of the Year.  Kelly Blue Book rates it with the lowest projected costs during initial five-year ownership period. \n\nDrivers love it too. The Volt ranked first, for a second year in a row, in Consumer Reports' list of owner-satisfaction based on its 2012 Annual Auto Survey, with 92% respondents who owned the Volt saying they definitely would purchase that same vehicle again. \n\nThe first generation of this car is now at it's end, and there's tons of data available that show just how game-changing this car is for the average driver. If you can convince me that all of this won't get more Volts on the road, a delta is yours.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nEDIT: Thanks for the time today. This slowly morphed from \"GM's Marketing Department sucks because....\" to \"The Volt sucks because....\" and \"Actually the Volt doesn't suck because....\" \n\nIn the end, I was convinced that no amount of marketing can end the amount of political football that the Volt was unfortunately roped into. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
