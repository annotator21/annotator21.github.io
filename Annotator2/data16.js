Clearly it's not as bad as alcohol and not needed to calculate a \"safe\" dose in the case of caffeine but cleaclearly labeling the caffeine content will allow people to see how much caffeine they ingest at a glance. Many people are not aware of how much caffeine is in soda and often get addicted to caffeine without realizing it is happeneing. I think that one of the reasons beverage companies use caffeine in many drinks is to get people hooked on that beverage. Many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep. Caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine. Overall I think adding the content will help because it subliminaly shows people that caffeine is a drug and should be treated like it while increasing consumer awareness and choice while also not discouraging or inconvenienceing anyone who chooses to use caffeine.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I just think that sodas, energy drinks, and other beverages with caffeine in them should display the content more prominently on the package so it catches the consumer or potential consumer's eye more easily."}, {"id": "cmus9e9", "body": "Ahh... this is very helpful.

So, I drink coke all the time, and it's a quick high for a few hours with a crash.

First time I really started drinking black tea I didn't feel any effects of caffeine until I realized I had been up all night and still wasn't tired.\n\nSo, I'd say labelling specific quantities of caffeine is actually not that useful.

Many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep. Caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine.

In fact, they only reduce the noise level from around 180 to 120 dB. Their main purpose is to reduce hearing damage and noise pollution. In fact, many countries in Europe encourage if not require you to use one when hunting or shooting. Therefore, suppressors should not be a controlled item or only require a background check.\n\nMachine Guns: As it currently stands, machine guns produced after 1986 are illegal to own. The only thing this does is drive up prices to an absurd degree (A pre-ban machine gun will cost you around $20,000). This ban should be lifted to allow more people a chance to own one. Keep in mind that since 1934, only two murders have been committed with legally owned machine guns and one of those was by a police officer (who are exempt from this ban anyway).\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In fact, they only reduce the noise level from around 180 to 120 dB. Their main purpose is to reduce hearing damage and noise pollution.

There is a substantial amount of paperwork, background checks, law enforcement approval, and fingerprinting that goes into it. It can often take months for final approval. It would be similar to what SBRs are currently, which is to say rare.\n\n&gt;I mean, do you really want to live in a world where the local burglar can break into your neighbor's house when he's not there and steal his machine gun?\n\nThey can already do that if my neighbor has a pre-86 machine gun. Considering there are currently over a quarter million machine guns already, I doubt adding a few thousand more will significantly increase crime statistics."}, {"id": "2p9pjb", "body": "I believe that short barrel rifles and firearm suppressors should be completely removed from the regulations of the National Firearms Act and it should be legal to produce/own machine guns made after 1986. I'll go into my specific reasons below.\n\nSBRs: I have yet to see a valid reason for the heavy regulations in place for short barrel rifles. Currently, [this](https://i.imgur.com/kA6wkOI.jpg) is considered a pistol and can be bought at any gun store with just a background check. But [this](http://www.zahal.org/files/images/fab/New05.10/glockstock2copy.jpg) is considered an SBR and one must complete an onerous amount of paperwork to own one. This makes no sense and SBRs should be treated like any other firearm.\n\nSuppressors: Contrary to what video games tell you, suppressors don't make a firearm completely silent. In fact, they only reduce the noise level from around 180 to 120 dB. Their main purpose is to reduce hearing damage and noise pollution. In fact, many countries in Europe encourage if not require you to use one when hunting or shooting. Therefore, suppressors should not be a controlled item or only require a background check.\n\nMachine Guns: As it currently stands, machine guns produced after 1986 are illegal to own. The only thing this does is drive up prices to an absurd degree (A pre-ban machine gun will cost you around $20,000). This ban should be lifted to allow more people a chance to own one. Keep in mind that since 1934, only two murders have been committed with legally owned machine guns and one of those was by a police officer (who are exempt from this ban anyway).\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'll go into my specific reasons below.\n\nSBRs: I have yet to see a valid reason for the heavy regulations in place for short barrel rifles. Currently, [this](https://i.imgur.com/kA6wkOI.jpg) is considered a pistol and can be bought at any gun store with just a background check. But [this](http://www.zahal.org/files/images/fab/New05.10/glockstock2copy.jpg) is considered an SBR and one must complete an onerous amount of paperwork to own one. This makes no sense and SBRs should be treated like any other firearm.\n\nSuppressors: Contrary to what video games tell you, suppressors don't make a firearm completely silent. In fact, they only reduce the noise level from around 180 to 120 dB. Their main purpose is to reduce hearing damage and noise pollution. In fact, many countries in Europe encourage if not require you to use one when hunting or shooting. Therefore, suppressors should not be a controlled item or only require a background check.\n\nMachine Guns: As it currently stands, machine guns produced after 1986 are illegal to own. The only thing this does is drive up prices to an absurd degree (A pre-ban machine gun will cost you around $20,000). This ban should be lifted to allow more people a chance to own one. Keep in mind that since 1934, only two murders have been committed with legally owned machine guns and one of those was by a police officer (who are exempt from this ban anyway).\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Collectors can still pay for automatic weapons, and though there is additional onus on the buyer and an additional financial burden, it is not prohibitive to the point of a Second Amendment violation\n\nAdditionally, everything you wrote about firearm ownership in the first three paragraphs is outside of the scope of this CMV.

Statistically speaking, there is a higher probability that someone will be murdered in Chicago, *today,* than there's risk of homicide by full-auto firearm in any given decade between the end of alcohol prohibition and the ban in question.

Currently, [this](https://i.imgur.com/kA6wkOI.jpg) is considered a pistol and can be bought at any gun store with just a background check. But [this](http://www.zahal.org/files/images/fab/New05.10/glockstock2copy.jpg) is considered an SBR and one must complete an onerous amount of paperwork to own one. This makes no sense and SBRs should be treated like any other firearm.\n\nSuppressors: Contrary to what video games tell you, suppressors don't make a firearm completely silent. In fact, they only reduce the noise level from around 180 to 120 dB. Their main purpose is to reduce hearing damage and noise pollution. In fact, many countries in Europe encourage if not require you to use one when hunting or shooting. Therefore, suppressors should not be a controlled item or only require a background check.\n\nMachine Guns: As it currently stands, machine guns produced after 1986 are illegal to own. The only thing this does is drive up prices to an absurd degree (A pre-ban machine gun will cost you around $20,000). This ban should be lifted to allow more people a chance to own one. Keep in mind that since 1934, only two murders have been committed with legally owned machine guns and one of those was by a police officer (who are exempt from this ban anyway).\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't necessarily disagree that they should be deregulated to some degree, but the reasoning is different.\n\nShort barreled rifles and suppressors are both allowed in countries with much stricter gun control laws than the US. Suppressors are an extremely practical safety device for hunting, recreational, and defensive uses, and short barrels are also highly desirable any time you're adding ~10\" to your barrel length with a suppressor.\n\nAt the very least, I think we should reduce suppressors to background check only. A more involved background check than is required for gun purchases is a reasonable compromise, a $200 tax stamp is not and neither is 6 months to process the applications.

No part of a suppressor ever touches a bullet, so there is no way to alter/obscure the rifling characteristics that are imparted onto a fired round.\n\nThat being said, 10 seconds with a metal file will absolutely obscure the rifling characteristics of a barrel to the point that a ballistics match is impossible. \n\nLikewise, firing a couple hundred rounds will do the same. \n\n&gt;The bigger picture is that none of the items you listed serve any beneficial purpose to society.\n\nHow are suppressors not a net improvement to society?
