To discriminate just means to categorize and treat each category differently.  Everyone discriminates all the time, and it isn't a bad thing - I discriminate against restaurants that have shitty food, and I don't go back.\n\nWhether its *morally wrong* to discriminate in this instance is what you need to be arguing.  And I think there are several completely different questions here:\n\n1. Is it morally wrong for the government to provide women only shelters, and not men only shelters (or at least enough gender-neutral shelters to accommodate)?  I would say yes - this is morally wrong and creates an unnecessary disadvantage, which the government has no business doing.\n\n2. Is it morally wrong for private charity to provide women only shelters, and not men only shelters (or at least enough gender-neutral shelters to accommodate)?  I would say no - private charities have the right to spend money how they want, and if it so happens that more charities want to spend money on women than on men, then I think that's unfortunate but understandable, and really the only response is to start new charities if you feel strongly about it.\n\n3. Is it morally wrong for private business to provide women only gyms, and not men only gyms?  I would say no - businesses have the right to cater to their chosen clientele, and if it so happens that women only gyms are profitable, and men only gyms are not, then more power to them who discover they can provide a desired service and make some money.  On the other hand, it does seem to skirt rather closely to anti-discrimination laws (can you imagine a gym that only allows white customers?) but gender has a weird relationship with such laws (obviously, gendered bathrooms and locker rooms and such things are still the norm, unlike any other protected class)."}, {"id": "cn9h999", "body": "You're conflating moral obligations with legal obligations.

For example, 60 of domestic abuse victims are women. Men are more likely to be working, and as such have the availability of funds to stay in a hotel. Women are, due to the biases and existing structures of society, less likely to be the main earner in a family. As such there is a further imbalance than these numbers state.

It would be ideal to have one centre but the risk of an abusing partner turning up under the guise of getting help and then finding and further abusing their partner is good reason to separate them by gender.

Or, flat out, just don't want to be bothered by men while trying to go about their business. \n\nI'm sure that you've heard things like \"women shouldn't have to do X and Y to not get raped/abused/assaulted; men should exert some self control and behave like decent human beings and not take advantage of/harm women (or anyone, but for the sake of argument we will stick with women).\" Well, just that. In a perfect society people would respect each other, but it's not and they don't. \n\nWomen's shelters are often specifically for women who have been the victims of domestic violence - and unfortunately, many shelters who accept children as well implement an age restriction for boys - basically, no pubescent boys are allowed in women's shelters. Think of domestic violence toward women and what it entails: beatings, sexual coercion and rape, emotional and mental abuse. PTSD is extremely common in DV survivors, and, well, being around men and young men after such an ordeal could definitely trigger a stress response. Because women's shelters exist to help women get past these issues enough to live a decent quality life and find their independence, it just makes sense not to allow men to be there. \n\nAs for gyms, this one is a bit different but with a similar guise. Personally, I've never seen a women's only gym, but it doesn't surprise me one bit, and as a matter of fact, I might be so inclined to find one because men behaving like pigs is the sole reason I will not go to a gym or purchase a gym membership. Now, I'm aware that plenty of people meet at the gym and stuff like that. But under no circumstances would I like to be pestered and harassed while I'm trying to run on a treadmill or use an elliptical. I have no problem shooting men down, but do I really want to have my workout experience ruined because some jerk thinks me ignoring him is an invitation to put his face closer to mine, wave his hands in my face, and shout at it (yes, I have actually had men do this to me in multiple situations where I was approached and ignored them), and then call me a bitch/cunt for snapping and telling him to fuck off/get out of my face/take a hint, I don't want you to talk to me??? No thanks.

If I had to go through a traumatic experience (like domestic violence or being assaulted at the gym before or after a workout) - and considering I may want to continue pursuing things like intimate relationships and physical fitness, I'd certainly seek out a place where I could safely recuperate or continue my regular routines without feeling threatened. "}, {"id": "cn9nfrn", "body": "Funny I find this thread; in the wee hours of this morning, my husband and I had a lengthy discussion about sexism, male privilege, and females taking subconscious and conscious precautions when out and about (like walking on the curb side of the sidewalk so as to not get pulled into an alley/doorway).\n\nI have to agree that I think it is somewhat sexist to have \"female only\" gyms and shelters, but when considering the things that we, as women, have to endure on a daily basis, I can see the \"female only\" gyms and shelters as somewhat of a safe haven for women who have been abused or might be afraid they will be abused. Or, flat out, just don't want to be bothered by men while trying to go about their business. \n\nI'm sure that you've heard things like \"women shouldn't have to do X and Y to not get raped/abused/assaulted; men should exert some self control and behave like decent human beings and not take advantage of/harm women (or anyone, but for the sake of argument we will stick with women).\" Well, just that. In a perfect society people would respect each other, but it's not and they don't. \n\nWomen's shelters are often specifically for women who have been the victims of domestic violence - and unfortunately, many shelters who accept children as well implement an age restriction for boys - basically, no pubescent boys are allowed in women's shelters. Think of domestic violence toward women and what it entails: beatings, sexual coercion and rape, emotional and mental abuse. PTSD is extremely common in DV survivors, and, well, being around men and young men after such an ordeal could definitely trigger a stress response. Because women's shelters exist to help women get past these issues enough to live a decent quality life and find their independence, it just makes sense not to allow men to be there. \n\nAs for gyms, this one is a bit different but with a similar guise. Personally, I've never seen a women's only gym, but it doesn't surprise me one bit, and as a matter of fact, I might be so inclined to find one because men behaving like pigs is the sole reason I will not go to a gym or purchase a gym membership. Now, I'm aware that plenty of people meet at the gym and stuff like that. But under no circumstances would I like to be pestered and harassed while I'm trying to run on a treadmill or use an elliptical. I have no problem shooting men down, but do I really want to have my workout experience ruined because some jerk thinks me ignoring him is an invitation to put his face closer to mine, wave his hands in my face, and shout at it (yes, I have actually had men do this to me in multiple situations where I was approached and ignored them), and then call me a bitch/cunt for snapping and telling him to fuck off/get out of my face/take a hint, I don't want you to talk to me??? No thanks.

In that sense, I think the club making money from the general public greatly reduced its standing as a purely private club. \n\nI still think that private clubs should have the ability to restrict their membership, even if such restrictions are discriminatory. Should testicular cancer support groups be forced to admit women? Should sororities be forced to admit men and fraternities forced to admit women? Should the Black Jewels Ladies Golf Association be forced to let dudes play with them? Should the Yale Club be required to admit alumni from SUNY schools? I mean, freedom of association is still a thing, no?\n\nSo, if a fitness club is truly private--that is, there are no facilities rented out to the public, no \"open hours\" where non-members can pay a fee for limited access, no public restaurant or educational services, receives no government subsidies, and the club follows employment law, then I see no reason why men-only or women-only fitness clubs should not exist.\n\nAs for DV shelters, I can't speak to what it's like in other areas, but our local charity provides shelter services for both male and female victims and counseling services for victims and perpetrators of DV. In fact, they don't even discriminate by species--they also provide fostering services for pets belonging to victims of DV."}, {"id": "2qtorn", "body": "Well, while I was discussing the effects of feminism on another CMV post, a reddit user made a very good point in saying that female-only gyms and shelters are discriminatory.

You want to offer these large images for the desktop version of the site, but this can cause issues with mobile phones that may be on a poor connection. You can use CSS to modify the size of an image, but the full-size image still gets downloaded. This means everyone on mobile gets huge images they can't do anything with, and it slows down the whole experience for them. Using a redirect to a mobile version of the site would allow you to insert smaller sizes of images, so you don't run into this issue.\n\nI should note that there are some workarounds that exist, but they are still hacky at the moment; current standards simply don't offer a great way to tell the browser to \"download the 300x200 size image instead of the 8000x6000 size image\". But there are proposals in place to deal with this in HTML5: for example, the &lt;picture&gt; tag. ([Here's a link that describes both the problem, some solutions, and the &lt;picture&gt; tag proposal.](http://html5hub.com/html5-picture-element/))\n\nI suspect in 5-10 years, adequate solutions will be in place so this is no longer an issue.

Because I've *never* heard of that happening ever.\n\nYour second point is problematic, because it assumes that self improvement ought to be pursued by people who don't aspire to it. Telling someone that they are adequate is *not* going to prevent people who want to \"improve\" from doing so, it's only going to make sure people with no desire to \"improve\" (whatever that means) aren't forced into feeling inadequate, especially given that it's almost impossible to inspire people to improve without prioritising certain goals over others\n\nYour third point doesn't in any way suggest that the system encourages mediocrity, only that certain institutions are less than meritocracy, but meritocracy and mediocrity aren't opposites: in fact there are many institutions which maintain anti-meritocractic systems or positions that are far from mediocre\n\nYour fourth point is just plain wrong. The people at those institutions are considerably above average, if you're saying they're not intelligent then you're saying that there are even less intelligent people outside those institutions\n\nYour fifth point is again, just plain wrong, but regardless how does this indicate that a culture is mediocre?

For starters, the US is unique in the fact that it often rejects the specialization present in the education systems of the rest of the world (the idea of a 'core curriculum' at universities is almost unheard of elsewhere).\n\nYour seventh point is wrong: standardised testing isn't about testing the student, it's about gathering data and assessing people. If it didn't work, they wouldn't use it.\n\nYour eight point is also completely false. There is nowhere anywhere in the world where people who think like that are the majority, I would guess you're just using 'critical thinking and reasoning' in quite a narrow (and possibly euphemistic) sense\n\nYour ninth point reflects an attitude that's common to most of the world, but I think you've misidentified what people see as onerous: *basic* maths and science are seen as onerous, their more complicated or applied forms might be viewed as *esoteric*, but basic maths is (quite rightly) viewed as onerous. I don't think it's seen as any more difficult than many other disciplines, however (in fact I would say that maths is, on the whole, seen as less esoteric than something like the law, or philosophy)\n\nAnd I'd like you to elaborate on your tenth point, as it seems completely unrelated to your other points, and I have a feeling you're going to contradict your fifth point in trying to explain why the body acceptance movement 'encourages mediocrity' "}, {"id": "2qsof1", "body": "I could talk for days about this topic, but the evidence (a combination of anecdotal and empirical) has lead me to conclude that mediocrity and ignorance is actively, globally encouraged, and particularly so in the United States.\n\n* politicians can actually be criticized for being too smart, there should be no such thing as too smart\n* schools actively promote the idea that everyone is okay as they are.

How exactly does this encourage ignorance?\n\n&gt;Standardized tests are farcically easy\n\nStandardized tests are based on average performances. We are judged based on each other. Which standardized tests are you referring to exactly? The SAT and the ACT are simply meant to judge some of your skill based on your peers. \n\n&gt;Many parts of the country actually have an active disdain of critical thinking and reasoning\n\nDamn this is vague.

That's a start. And consider the new technology recently. It's slow, but we're getting *somewhere*. \n\nLook. I think your view boils down to this:\n\n* education+society in the United States does not encourage self-betterment, and,\n\n* education in the US should be more challenging. \n\nI agree with the second point. But there *are* some schools which are challenging. There are others which accommodate mediocracy. However,\n\nIf you are excellent in the west, you are more likely to succeed. Evaluation, (i.e. grades) is in place for this reason. \n\nMaybe we don't value excellence *enough*? Hey, you can never value excellence enough. But it would be a stretch to say it values mediocracy.

It is easy for someone who is a genius to use that to succeed in things like business trading and the stock market but those options are not available to the average citizen. It is like saying the person has to much money. While this is honestly never a negative for the individual it would make them out of touch with an impoverished community and not able to understand their problems as well or relate to what they need.\n\n&gt;schools actively promote the idea that everyone is okay as they are  \n\nWhile it can come across this way, I have not seen most schools pushing kids to stop improving. The general idea behind this mindset is that we are all unique and will be able to contribute to society in some way. You may not be good at math and can barely read, but maybe you are excellent at art and can paint or sing better then anyone else in the school. Find your strengths and work to eliminate your weaknesses while realizing that you as a person have worth.\n\n&gt;Ivy league (and similar) students are considered smarter than their peers, but most of the student body got there through money or nepotism (I have personally experienced this)\n\nHaving not experience this firsthand it is hard for me to say. I am certain that there are Ivy leagures who are there only because of alumni parents with big wallets but even then they are usually schooled and educated to a degree to at least do what needs to be done. These schools don't get a reputation for putting out some of the best and brightest by allowing idiots to skate by.\n\n&gt;There are no difficult subjects to learn  \n  \nWell then you sir are a genius and should apply for a MacArthur Genius grant ;). There are lots of difficult subjects to learn, and in many ways it depends on who you are. I was able to learn computer programming and IT networking with ease. IT just all made sense to me out the gate. But I can't find the beat in a song to save my life. And I hate dealing with geometry.\n\n&gt;The emphasis on specialization of learning/skill encourages weakness and ignorance rather than strength and knowledge\n\nThe problem is that some skills require you to be highly specialized. I don't want a surgeon performing on me without him knowing every god damn thing there is to know about his craft. And I don't want that bomb defusal guy who is defusing the bomb next to me to have only a certificate from a week long course in bomb disposal. I do agree that a broad base is an excellent strength and most colleges and highschools do push you towards that by requiring you take electives outside your major.\n\n&gt;Standardized tests are farcically easy  \n  \nThen why are the average SAT scores in the 60%? (Critical reading:497. Mathematics: 513). Again, just because you are smart with excellent critical thinking skills does not mean that everyone or even a majority of people are.\n\n&gt;Many parts of the country actually have an active disdain of critical thinking and reasoning \n  \nOh dat south :( But that is hardly US culture as a whole.\n\n&gt;math and science are often viewed as difficult or onerous  \n  \nMath and Science ARE difficult for most people. There is lots of memorization and the application of multiple different laws theorems and formulas simultaneously is not a skill most people possess. Again they may come easy to you but I bet there are things you can't do that someone else would say is easy.\n\n&gt;the entirety of the body-acceptance movement  \n  \nThis is hardly mainstream from what I have seen. It started out as something worthwhile (to fight bulimia and anorexia) and was co-opted into something where you aren't supposed to mentions peoples weight or health at all. But honestly I have yet to see super hardcore body acceptance types outside of the internet or some talk shows where they are there next to some neo nazi talking about how fat white women are just like that because of evil black jews or some other trash for ratings.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2qsof1", "body": "I could talk for days about this topic, but the evidence (a combination of anecdotal and empirical) has lead me to conclude that mediocrity and ignorance is actively, globally encouraged, and particularly so in the United States.\n\n* politicians can actually be criticized for being too smart, there should be no such thing as too smart\n* schools actively promote the idea that everyone is okay as they are.

I have no issue with this but it generally encourages the notion that one should not pursue self-improvement\n\nSchools promote the idea that you should feel comfortable with who you are. (beliefs, heritage, sexual orientation, etc.) I don't believe that this stifles self-improvement. Actually, I think that it *helps* kids improve themselves, as it gives kids a sense of identity. \n\n&gt; Ivy league (and similar) students are considered smarter than their peers, but most of the student body got there through money or nepotism (I have personally experienced this)\n\nYes, you do have to have a fairly significant amount of money (or a hefty scholarship) to go to most Ivy League schools. Does that mean that all ivy league students are rich snobs who don't know anything and just ride off the back of their daddies' paycheck? not necessarily.\n\n&gt; Building off the previous point, very, very few people at any Ivy (and similar) are actually intelligent\n\nI find this *very* difficult to believe without a large amount of empirical evidence. \n\n&gt; There are no difficult subjects to learn.\n\nI don't know how to respond to that.

Math and science are both subjects that you have to actually work for. As many online science videos series (ie minutephysics) has shown us, the public is interested in this stuff, they just don't want to put in the hours. \n\n&gt; the entirety of the body-acceptance movement\n\nHow does the body-acceptance movement \"encourage mediocrity\"? Most people who aren't happy with being fat want to loose weight because they want to be healthy, not because society scorns them for being fat. (although that is a factor) One of the reasons that fat people don't work out is because they don't want people thinking \"Hey, look the fat guy is working out again.\" If the general public would accept fat people for who they are, it would make it easier for them to get healthier and \"less mediocre\" \n \n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2qslmz", "body": "*for title clarification, I am NOT referring to either of the paragon or renegade affiliations as the main topic for this post*\n\nThe Mass Effect games, however flawed though they may be, are some of my favorite games of all time. Now that my bias is clear, I want to say that the completely irrational anger that you may see in the post below IS the reason I'd like my view changed. I apologize for offending anyone and for sounding like an ass. Needless to say, this post is really only meant for those who've played the series, but if you're not afraid of spoilers then feel free to chime in. \n\nSo here's the brunt of my CMV: If you let any one of your squadmates die, (unless their deaths are unavoidable) you are:\n\na.) incompetent \n\nTalk to squadmates semi-regularly, do the loyalty missions, buy the ship upgrades, and -for Gaben's sake- put some points into persuade (you Neanderthal!), and don't make stupid (YES STUPID) choices during the final ME2 mission. It's really not that difficult with a little common sense! RNG killed Mordin during the suicide mission? RELOAD A DAMN SAVE. It's worth it dammit! \n\nb.) rushing/missing the damn point of the game\n\nDon't give me that \"I don't have time\" crap; you bought an RPG! You're already taking a good bit time to play the game, so why not take a little more and immerse yourself in the sexy sci-fi universe you paid good money for? You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore.\n\nc.) unfit to fairly criticize the series\n\nFirstly, I want to say that I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was (see the original Kapysharn plot outline for details). However despite its shortcomings, I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters. With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities. \n\nFor example, (SPOILERS ME3) seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly, the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material. \n\nWithout these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 didn't live up to the hype. How could it? It's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide. In my opinion, it's a complete waste of the player's time going about it that way. Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment, I believe there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies.   \n\nI need help guys. It's getting to the point where I can't even discuss Mass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet. Hell, I've put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseat-gaming during his playthrough.  I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them, but for whatever reason it's different for me when it comes to Mass Effect in particular. Please, CMV!\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to say that I don't take issue with making an intentionally flawed Shepard to see what it looks like. It's just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could've missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole. \n\nBah, apologies!

He was my favorite character, and I had to suffer through 3 watching Wreav royally screw things up.  However, it made me appreciate his loss that much more, *and* inspired me to do a later playthrough with a different outcome.  I didn't get *less* content than you, I just got *different* content than you.

I'd actually planned for that to be the one I went with, but given how the whole stupid Crucible felt like it was just ignoring everything he'd done... yeah, didn't sit well with me. I wanted to leave the game feeling *something* besides vaguely discontented and annoyed with it, which is why shitty-Shep happened. \n\nI do get what you mean by the whole emotional payoff from saving people - I did really enjoy those moments and I think those individual arcs were fantastically written and seriously impactful. I just think the ending of the game really let them down, and in a pretty disappointing manner, too. So while I enjoy them as individual character arcs, when I think about the playthrough I want to remember as my last, shitty-Shep that burnt pretty much every bridge it was possible to burn until only three choices were left is far more satisfying to me from a literary, storytelling perspective. \n\nAnyway, that's kind of why I'd say there's no One Best Way - the right choice is one that satisfies the player emotionally. For some people that's saving everyone, but quitting before the final sequence and reading a fan-made ending. For other people that's sticking it through to the end just so they can say they finished it and then washing their hands of the series. For you it's to save everyone. For me it was making the World's Worst Shepard. And so on and so forth. \n\nBut I'm kinda glad to have changed your view. I totally get wanting people to see the things that made you happy, but I'd suggest instead of being like 'no you must play THIS way and make THIS choice' you encourage people to try the game more than once so that they can see what would happen if they made a different choice instead, as opposed to railroading them down your route for their first run.

Thanks guys!"}, {"id": "cn96r45", "body": "There are multiple ways squadmates can die through reasonable play, even in a completionist run. \n\nME1: Wrex can die on Virmire if you don't have enough persuade points and you didn't do the easy to miss side mission for the armor. I know you said you should put some points into persuade, but if I recall you need a lot of persuade without the armor.\n\nME2: You can do every loyalty mission and still end up with disloyal squadmates going into the suicide mission. It's very easy to end up with an disloyal Zaeed if you take the paragon route for example. Also, Tali's loyalty mission is like Wrex on Virmie, you need a decent amount of persuade to get a good ending. Off the top of my head you can also \"complete\" Samara's and Thane's loyalty missions without them becoming loyal by saying the wrong things in the bar or missing QTEs on the catwalk. So any of those could be a dead squadmate in the suicide mission.\n\nAnd that even leaves out the big one: Legion. In order to save the entire crew and do Legion's loyalty mission you need to be finished every side mission before you install the IFF so his loyalty mission is available before Joker's hobble-run through the ship. Leave a few side missions until after the IFF and you may have to choose between a loyal Legion and half the crew. And, to make it worse, there's no way to know this in advance without a guide. So install the IFF when you still have a few side missions left and you could have a dead Geth on the collector ship.\n\nOh, and even if you get the good ending on every loyalty mission you could still end up with disloyal squadmates by siding with one when they fight on the ship. Again, with enough persuade you can settle the argument, but what if you agree with Tali or Jack and decide not to take the diplomatic route?\n\nAdd to that that even a mostly completionist run doing everything right could opt to skip a loyalty mission for good reasons (screw you Miranda, you god damn Cerberus cheerleader) and there are a lot of very reasonable ways to lose a squadmate or two on the suicide mission, especially if you assign a disloyal squadmate a task because you don't know how the deaths are calculated (and how would you on your first playthrough?) \n\nME3: Even if everyone survives the suicide mission, there's also a number of ways you can lose squadmates in 3. If you have a disloyal Tali or Legion from ME2 on Rannoch its almost impossible for both to survive, especially if you do the Rannoch side missions in the wrong order. If you agree with the Salarians on the genophage you'll lose Wrex. And in the end even if you do absolutely everything \"right\" and you choose destroy you kill EDI.\n\nTL;DR: Even if you do every mission and you have enough persuade you can still lose people, especially if you choose options you think are \"right\" rather than just blindly aiming for maximum survival.

The game has plenty of difficulty levels, some for the story, some for the action. \n\n&gt;real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters\n\nAnd they are all the exact same throughout each play through because all your decisions are 'the right ones' \n\n&gt;a completionist run where NO ONE dies.\n\nExcept mordin. \n\n&gt;It's just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could've missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole.\n\nYou can never experience everything mass effect has to offer in one playthrough, why not take that in stride and not try to? Two playthroughs that are 'imperfect' according to you will still offer you more than one 'perfect' playthrough.

Of course it's possible (not even all that difficult) to OD on alcohol. But the fact of the matter is that, the closer you get to ODing, the more the pharmacological effects of the drug inhibit your ability to keep drinking. That's why 4-Loco was banned: people got alcohol poisoning drinking it because the caffeine prevented them from passing out or getting tired, so they ended up drinking longer and more than they would have otherwise. \n\nCompare that with cocaine. The most basic and obvious difference is that in most cases you know how much alcohol you are ingesting (unless you are drinking trash can punch at a party or something). Coke, on the other hand, varies wildly in purity. An amount of one batch that might have been appropriate could theoretically kill you if the next batch is more pure. \n\nMoreover, cocaine has the opposite effect of alcohol. It makes you feel energized and invincible--which is a mind set that will often lead people to snort more cocaine. The comedown on cocaine is also extremely unpleasant... this is just another reason for a person whose judgement is already being impaired by the drug to keep using more. \n\nStatistically, cocaine quadruples the risk of sudden death in users, mostly because of how easy it is to overdose on the drug. Yes, if \"used in moderation,\" experimenting with coke a few times isn't going to kill you. But the drug itself puts users in a state of mind where they are unlikely to use it in moderation.  Saying \"coke is no more dangerous than alcohol, if used in moderation\" already ignores the fact that using the drug in moderation might be harder--first of all, because it's easier to overdose, and second of all, because cocaine is far more physically addictive than alcohol. \n\nAll this being said, I agree that alcohol is a far more dangerous drug than many people are willing to admit. A [study](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm) released by a former chief drug advisor to the British government ranked alcohol as the single most harmful drug in the UK.

Had he repeated that throw at the Games, he'd have won gold. But Reiterer did not compete in Sydney.

You will learn that when he broke a junior world record, he was treated with indifference by a hypocritical system which perpetuated the problem while simultaneously denouncing it in the media. Werner went to two Olympics as a \u201cnatural\u201d, steadfastly sticking to his guns.

Imagine how many more would die if everyone doped by default. Because that's what would happen.
