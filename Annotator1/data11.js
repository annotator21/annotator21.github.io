There are some companies, even retail, where having an employee smoking outside would probably be a form of positive advertising for them. Whether this was because the company was trying to be \"edgy\" or whether it promoting freedom of expression etc, I could see this working positively for them. \n\nEqually, a lot of companies promote an internal culture, to help keep the morale of employees up and help them feel important in the company. Rules such as this may not be well received, and you would have to weigh up whether you would lose more customers from employees being allowed to smoke wherever they want or whether you would lose more customers from employees having attitude during work.\n\nI don't think I would be able to change your view if you dislike being around smoking, in fact I personally think smoking should be limited in all public places also.

Of course not! We will demand higher taxes on that higher corporate disposable income and establish a [basic income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) so our people aren't forced to starve in the streets while the wealthy do whatever with their piles of money.\n\nSo now that I have laid out a viable alternative to your theory, let me tell you why the wealthy will be for it: if all wealth leaves the average citizens hands without any way for them to getting it back, what are the corporations going to do with all of the money? It will essentially become meaningless numbers stored in databases that will do nothing because there wouldn't be an economy anymore.\n\nThe wealthy needs the average person to spend money, even if it means giving it back to them for them to spend again."}, {"id": "2rcsdh", "body": "Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.\n\n&gt;There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services.

I am against factory farming but I believe that we can and should live in a mutually beneficial relationship with farmyard animals, chickens are my favourite example.\n\nNature is brutal and animals controlled by a conscious mind are subject to all the ills that the environment can throw at them. I believe that conscious experience is generally a positive thing, even if about half of your life is spent suffering it's still better than being some grass or a tree because it's better to have experienced than not.\n\nNow let's say that I have a bunch of chickens in my garden, I feed and protect them from predators and parasites, provide them with warmth and shelter and they just get along with chicken business like laying, roosting, pecking and clucking about the place. They aren't really conscious of being captive because they're bird brains, but if they were smart enough to make a decision about where to live then with me would be far better than in the woods where they are likely to be eaten by foxes. Even if they end up as Sunday dinner one day, and even if I never allow them to breed or if I do I still snatch and murder their male offspring, a life in my garden is a better life than one in the woods, while both lives are better than no life at all. I consider this sort of hand-reared chicken to be so ethical a form of meat that it's slightly unethical for me not to keep chickens, and IMO the only reasonable way to be against this is either to also be in favour of exterminating all animals that possess the curse of consciousness (perhaps humans included), or to be of the opinion that killing things is always wrong, which is cute I guess.\n\nOf course a factory chicken that has its beak chopped off and is then shoved in a crate of its own shit while it grows or lays and has a poor enough experience of the world that it would be better off never being born, to bring animals into existence and have them suffer like that for the sake of greed is cruel and should be banned. We should have laws against people treating living, feeling things like pieces of shit.\n\nSo in summary, ethical meat exists where the animals have a positive life experience, better than they would have in the wild. To want to end this is to extinguish entire species just because you have developed some lofty ideals about what murder is and isn't, which is in my opinion an unreasonable position."}, {"id": "cnetcl9", "body": "Someone going vegan and someone becoming an ethical carnivore reduce demand for factory-farmed meat by exactly the same amount (1 person).

I'm afraid I have to take the title at face value and assume that it is actually an opinion you hold that you want changed.\n\nNow let's talk about what exactly it means to \"improve farm welfare\". I think it's safe to assume that any person (and most, if not all, farmed non-human animals can and should be considered persons in the philosophical sense) cannot be meaningfully said to have a happy existence if that person is\n\n1. kept captive from birth until death,\n\n2. killed at a young age instead of being allowed to live healthfully as long as possible, and\n\n3. forced to bear children that will have the same kind of existence.\n\nThere is no way that current rates of producing animal flesh and secretions for human consumption can possibly continue if these three assumptions are not met. In particular, the only way to eliminate point (3) is to reduce demand. Otherwise, people must breed animals in order to ensure that supply meets demand.\n\nSo my point is that your fifth assumption is totally invalid. You can't possibly claim that killing a cow at a quarter of their natural lifespan is in any sense ethical -- not if that killing was unnecessary. And it was unnecessary, because there is a scientific consensus\n\\[[1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864),\n[2](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx),\n[3](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx),\n[4](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition),\n[5](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/),\n[6](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html),\n[7](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf),\n[8](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446),\n[9](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)\\]\nthat every man, woman, and child is perfectly capable of living their entire lives without consuming animal products. So there is *no such thing* as an ethical farm. There are only less unethical farms.\n\nThe only way to eliminate the economic forces that make farms inherently unethical is to reduce demand. That has to start with you. By going vegan, you do two things. You eliminate the demand that comes from you, and you demonstrate to other less-informed people that the vegan lifestyle is practicable.\n\nFinal note: I am fully aware that meat is tasty, but taste preferences are not an ethical justification for killing innocents.

Yes, if every vegetarian switched to eating free-range, grass-fed beef raised on small farms the market share of ethical meat would increase, but only because the market as a whole got bigger. It wouldn't actually decrease the suffering or numbers of a single factory farmed animal; it would just result in more animals being eaten overall. So unless it's better for an animal to be raised eaten than to have never existed (which, to be fair, is arguable if the animal led a happy life), this can't really be said to help animal welfare in a meaningful sense.\n\nThe point that it's easier to shift to eating ethically raised meat to full-on vegetarianism I agree with. It's certainly better to eat ethically raised meat than factory farmed meat.

Marketers do these kinds of commercials because they work. Car dealerships have been doing them for years, with some very dishonest and deceitful content really, and yet people flock back in droves. They count on lowest common denominators of human psychology and a lack of education on the part of the general public (which, unfortunately, is a relatively safe thing to bank on). \n\nIf, on the other hand, such commercials caused people to stop purchasing certain products, they would certainly be removed from the air. No marketer is willing to jeopardize products for a stupid ad campaign. Look at Quiznos' stupid little rat ads they did in 2004. They pulled the plug on the campaign based on the public's reaction to them. The ads generated buzz, which was what Quiznos wanted, but not in the way they had hoped and there was some indication that it was hurting sales. Hurting sales is the best way to change a company's tune about pretty much anything.\n\nPeople forget they have a voice and therefore don't use it. Vote with your money and encourage like minded people to do the same. Stop buying products from companies you'd rather not do business with and then let them know it. I do this all the time with businesses I don't care for. The problem is that most businesses can always count on someone to purchase their products, simply because they're familiar with the brand name, but generate enough negative buzz, and they'll change their tune.\n\nIf you hate obnoxious commercials, then unfortunately it's your responsibility to stop it. In some cases legal avenues may be appropriate, and some times it's just a matter of using your voice to promote what it is you'd like to see. The public's voice is what drives marketing and if you respond to commercials that are in poor taste by purchasing their products, you're encouraging the company to continue conducting business in ways you don't like.\n\nIn other words, you're setting the bar, not the companies making the commercials. Getting businesses to change is a matter of education, voting with your wallet, and voicing your opinions (as you're doing here) so that other people sit up and take notice. When a sufficient number of people take up the conversation, it gains a life and voice of it's own and the business changes, but pretending that it's the responsibility of the business is putting the cart before the horse.

That's roughly double the amount of games in the NBA regular season, and roughly ten times the number of games in the NFL regular season. This means that every team will play 5-6 games per week, except during the relatively short all-star break, for close to seven months (excluding the postseason). This has a number of negative effects. First, it leads to position players being injured through the wear-and-tear of playing so often. How often is a starting position player put out of commission for a couple weeks because of a tweaked hamstring or shoulder soreness or knee pain? Starting position players often have to be rested even when teams are in still in the hunt for a playoff berth just to avoid these wear-and-tear injuries.\n\nSecond, the sheer number of games hinders baseball's ability to be a more national sport like basketball or football. There are so many games that just trying to follow your local team will provide more than enough baseball for a year. I don't often feel motivated to watch a Yankees vs. Red Sox game on national TV when I have already seen 5 Rockies' games during the week. Compare with other major sports, especially football, where you can follow your team and still have plenty of time to follow the rest of the action. This is partially what allows football and basketball to be national sports and thus be more relevant in the national culture. The fatigue due to the number of games played dramatically reduces ratings for games on national TV.\n\nThird, the number of games also decreases *local* television ratings and fan attendance at the stadiums. When there are 162 games, there's no sense of missing out if you miss a game or five during the season, because no individual game is of much importance in itself (save for the last 20-30 games of the season played by a handful of the 30 teams chasing a playoff berth in September). This is especially true in the mid-season slog during June, July, and early August. \n\nFourth, it makes it harder for casual fans to become more devoted fans because it is just hard to follow a team with so many games to be played. It requires a great deal of motivation and time investment to become a more devoted fan, especially if your team isn't contending.\n\nFifth, and finally, the number of games means that the season must be very long in terms of time. Spring training starts at the beginning of March, while the World Series is played at the end of October. This causes two major problems. First, because baseball cannot be played in rough weather, and most teams play in open stadiums, this leads to a risk of games being cancelled due to snow in the early part of the season and the late part of the season and, crucially, during the playoffs. Second, this means that baseball must overlap with football at the end of the season which, given the utter dominance of football in the ratings and in sports coverage in the news, can only siphon fan attention and interest away from baseball right when it should be heating up.  \n\nI believe the regular season should be shortened by at least 20 games, and perhaps as many as 50-60, to deal with the above five issues.\n\nSo, Reddit, change my view!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Second, this means that baseball must overlap with football at the end of the season which, given the utter dominance of football in the ratings and in sports coverage in the news, can only siphon fan attention and interest away from baseball right when it should be heating up.\n\nHow often does snow actually cause baseball games to be delayed or cancelled? I can only think of a handful of times when this has happened. The season starts in April when the snow generally stops in most parts of the country, and ends in October before the snowy season typically starts.

It's really the only sport where you can take a kid or two to a game on limited notice without dropping $200+... in many places it'll be $50 for a couple seats.  That's really huge.  Take away games and increase pricing, and suddenly parents will simply take their kids to the zoo instead that day, college kids will go drink at a dive bar instead.\n\nBaseball is, for many, a super-casual sport that you turn on the tv/radio while you're BBQ'ing during the dog days of summer.

I don't think you can somehow instill a lot more meaning in each regular season game.  Baseball simply lacks the regular excitement of basketball/football... I say that a little bit subjectively, but I don't think there's a lot of debate.  It's a much more relaxed game.  \n\nBaseball is streaky &amp; stat driven game (which is what the hardcore fans obsess over), and removing the large sample will make it a lot more random.\n\nBaseball's only competitor during the season is MLS.  I think (accidentally) breaking baseball's model &amp; appeal combined with soccer fever (which currently happens every 4 years during the world cup) might be enough to split that casual audience.

For my point in hilarious comic form (credit to Zach Weiner of Saturday Morning Breakfast cereal) click [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/q1BUn).\n\nEdit* The most common objection was in my use of jerks in the title. When I wrote this I was being informal and what I mean is that by our standards animals are jerks. However, it is not fair to use our standards to evaluate animal morality. The view I have is that people who claim animals are somehow morally superior (for some of the reasons I listed above) are wrong and animals are not morally superior to humans.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Trials often drag on for weeks or months, because the evidence isn't so clear either way. \n\nSo you propose that, in the absence of evidence that 100% exonerates the officer, that the officer should be deemed guilty? An officer that could very well be innocent of the charges, and have done things correctly, but there's just not indisputable evidence of that? And thus, a good cop gets put away for life, targeted for harassment or worse in prison, and has their life ruined because their camera malfunctioned?\n\nEven WITH cameras, cases are not 100% clear cut either way. They are still subject to interpretation. And they do not pick up everything. Some sounds and images won't be captured, or won't be captured well. Smells, tactile sensations, etc. also won't be picked up by cameras. And if a camera shifts in a struggle with the suspect, it could wind up on the ground pointing at the sky. There may not be any useable or damning audio -- a suspect would likely silently raise their gun at the officer (while the camera was pointing a direction that couldn't capture that), and the officer could draw and shoot in response. Yet, in your world, because the camera fell off the officer  or shifted a different direction during a struggle, or while chasing the suspect, or whatever, that officer deserves jail time?\n\nNot to mention, part of the idea behind innocence until proven guilty is that, yes, some guilty people will get away with it. However, from there, the person could either rehabilitate themselves and never commit such crimes again... in which case that's a long term win for society. Or they will end up committing another crime, and then they could get caught and held accountable for it then. A corrupt cop isn't likely to engage in one act of corruption and be done with it for the rest of his career.

Obviously, treatment can only go so far, but eventually, these things will be curable and the restriction would be temporary.\n\nThe proposal is that diagnosis removes the possibility of possession which means that diagnosis (which already has considerable stigma attached to it because of how it limits an individual's rights) becomes that much more troubling. Furthermore the vast majority of things considered mental illnesses (for the sake of definition we'll more or less use the common definition of the term in the US in spite of the issues with it as it is the one assumed for the vast majority of these debates when no other definition is given, if it's in the most recent DSM it's a mental illness) are not temporary, they are lifelong conditions that are typically due to differences in neurology so the restriction would, by it being tied to the MI, always be permanent and to presume otherwise is to either be ignorant on the subject (most are and ignorance is not a bad thing so long as one is willing to learn) or to argue in bad faith.\n\n&gt;Okay, maybe we find some way to fix this issue. But, there are ways to protect your home without a gun. Australia seems to manage just fine.\n\nPlenty of countries fair fine without access to guns, a lot of it has to do with it being harder for criminals to get guns and that they only need them to deal with other criminals since the citizens aren't generally armed. That is, of course, beside the point since OP is positing something which presumes that citizens can own guns and the solutions in other countries affect that in general.\n\n&gt;You keep using the term \"casual link\", would you mind defining that for me?\n\nA causal link is where A causes B, in this case justifying the limiting of MI individual's rights in regards to gun ownership would be predicated on proving that MI individuals are more likely to be violent towards others. Interestingly enough a causal link has been shown between MI and violence repeatedly but it's that the MI are more likely to be victims.\n\n&gt;schizophrenia can cause this\n\n[A false stereotype](http://schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm#) perpetuated by the news and entertainment (it's easier to market violence as a result of somebody being \"other\" than humans simply being violent at times), interestingly enough you are far more likely to be struck by lightning (1/3000-1/700000) than to be assaulted by a schizophrenic or any MI individual, the rates are artificially inflated by those who are being held in facilities (this is a complex problem involving those already prone to violence being more likely to be held, fight-or-flight responses, and the often horrendous treatment of the mentally ill in facilities which can often leave people in far worse shape than when they went in) and far more likely to be assaulted by somebody leaving a sporting event (I don't have the stats on hand and couldn't really find them since the last time I saw them was about four years ago). [The schizophrenic actually only have a 9% chance of being violent within the first 20 weeks after being discharged (19% for depression, 15% for bipolar, 17.2% for all other psychotic disorders, 29% for all substance abuse, and 25% for all personality disorders)](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/180/6/490.full) but keep in mind that the stats have crossover. Most people in there for things like substance abuse also either have or leave with other diagnoses and most of the treatments used in those facilities have nasty withdrawal symptoms which most people discharged go through for one reason or another, a lot of psychopharmacology is just throwing pills at a person until something seems to work since the science is so immature (the pills essentially bathe the brain in a soup of certain neurotransmitters or blockers for them but we know that a more directed treatment is necessary since one transmitter does one thing in one area of the brain and a different thing in another).\n\n&gt;more extreme cases of bipolar\n\nAlso largely a myth, the bipolar and the schizophrenic are rather unlikely to be a risk to those around them but the same cannot be said in regard to themselves (this isn't entirely due to the conditions, the stigma causes all sorts of problems which is part of why depression is such a common comorbidity).\n\n&gt;antisocial removes the patients ability to determine right from wrong\n\nThat's not really what ASPD does, there's quite a bit of debate right now in research about it actually. The short and long of it is that ASPD is actually at least two unique conditions (which many researchers, and thus I for this conversation, refer to as sociopathy and psychopathy). A sociopath is born and isn't much more likely to engage in criminal behavior than an NT, in fact the few studies done in regards to this have suggested that sociopaths are more likely to become things like firefighters or soldiers (essentially they have a stronger drive to protect others but issues in forming certain types of bonds which make it hard for people to make tough choices like sacrificing another or themselves for the greater good). Psychopaths are made, usually by trauma or brain damage, and while they are slightly more likely to be violent than their baseline neurotype it still isn't that big of a concern (the real concern is the desire from power and the lack of certain inhibitions which keep them from abusing it, these sorts are more likely to take other high power-high risk jobs like being a police officer, lawyer, or various high-power corporate positions) as that violence is likely to come back to bite them. Both sociopaths and psychopaths can recognize right from wrong but a psychopath is less likely to care about that distinction so long as the ratio of risk to reward seems sufficient (psychopaths are more likely to take risks in general).\n\n&gt;Yes, depression counts as a mental illness. However, when talking about the \"mentally ill\", you tend to think of people with schizophrenia, antisocial, dissociative identity, borderline, general anxiety, the ones that cause people to worry much more if they had access to guns. Things like ADD/ADHD, OCD, Depression, etc. don't do this and as such, could be stipulated in the law.\n\nNot really, when most people are talking about mental illness they have nothing specific in mind and many, due to a combination of stigma and misinformation, think any diagnosis should limit rights. All of the conditions you listed are treated as being far more violent than they actually are.\n\n&gt;You mean when we've confirmed they are drunk? Eitherway, would you rather gamble on a drunk person hitting another car or a tree or something, killing roughly 1-5 or gamble on a mentally ill person shooting up a place, ending us up with another Sandy Hook or worse? There is much more risk with a mentally ill person getting a weapon than a drunk driver. That's why we have asylums, so that these people aren't a danger to themselves or others.\n\nI would much rather gamble on the latter, it's by far the safer option (unless you're hoping that your choice happens) since your average american has a 60% chance of being hit by a drunk driver (you're more likely to be hit by a drunk driver than you are to get cancer or win a coin flip) but better odds of being hit by lightning than assaulted by somebody mentally ill. Remember that common occurrences are not really news worthy which makes it seem like the less common thing is the more common (plane crashes are very rare but most people think they happen more than fatal car crashes). Also we don't have asylums to keep MI individuals from harming themselves or others, we have them to ensure that the individual is treated in the event that they either seem to be resistant to it or seem to be a danger to themselves or others (again asylums are generally a bad thing because our current treatments can cause serious harm).\n\n&gt;The odds of a mentally ill person killing people is much higher than a normal person.\n\nSee the rest of my comment, that idea is fundamentally false and based on a combination of misinformation and bias."}, {"id": "cneluhy", "body": "&gt;How so? If a diagnosis means having your rights taken away, why would that make you want to be diagnosed?\n\nDiagnosis and treatment are not the same thing. Diagnosis is telling you that you have the disease/disorder, treatment is making it better. If they want their guns, they'll try to get better as fast as they can. Obviously, treatment can only go so far, but eventually, these things will be curable and the restriction would be temporary.\n\n&gt;Here is a study showing that the MI are disproportionately victims of violence (http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/GeneralPsychiatry/31383).\n\nOkay, maybe we find some way to fix this issue. But, there are ways to protect your home without a gun. Australia seems to manage just fine.\n\n&gt;Citation please? I am not aware of any causal link between mental illness and violence.\n\nYou keep using the term \"casual link\", would you mind defining that for me? Also, I only claimed that mental illness causes changes in behavior from an unaffected person. Some of these changes can be violence (schizophrenia can cause this, more extreme cases of bipolar, antisocial removes the patients ability to determine right from wrong, so that one could cause it). I can't get sources as I'm on my phone as of now.\n\n&gt;Here's a source on racial disparity: http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/nov/27/bme-mental-health-admissions. Here's the World Health Organization report on disparity between genders for different conditions: http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/242.pdf\n\nJust because there's a difference between how many people of certain ethnicities get a disorder, doesn't mean that there's a bias. The Guardian is known for making these types of claims without evidence, so I can safely say that they're wrong. Same goes for gender disparity. Even if these things are true, they can be fixed and are not fundamental for the system to function. They can be fixed and are not an issue when deciding to take away guns from the mentally ill.\n\n&gt; Oh wow. No. Mental illness does not mean delusional or irrational. This is a complete misunderstanding. Depression, even when its mild enough not to change your behavior, is a mental illness. Please look up its definition.\n\nYes, depression counts as a mental illness. However, when talking about the \"mentally ill\", you tend to think of people with schizophrenia, antisocial, dissociative identity, borderline, general anxiety, the ones that cause people to worry much more if they had access to guns. Things like ADD/ADHD, OCD, Depression, etc. don't do this and as such, could be stipulated in the law.\n\n&gt;We allow them to drive without knowing whether they're drunk, only arresting them when we've confirmed they're not. This is not the same as preemptively removing gun rights from people who have never been violent.\n\nYou mean when we've confirmed they are drunk? Eitherway, would you rather gamble on a drunk person hitting another car or a tree or something, killing roughly 1-5 or gamble on a mentally ill person shooting up a place, ending us up with another Sandy Hook or worse? There is much more risk with a mentally ill person getting a weapon than a drunk driver. That's why we have asylums, so that these people aren't a danger to themselves or others.\n\n&gt;Some non-MI people will also kill others in the future.\n\nThe odds of a mentally ill person killing people is much higher than a normal person."}, {"id": "cnep8mj", "body": "&gt;Diagnosis and treatment are not the same thing.\n\nRight, but you have to be diagnosed to be treated - meaning if someone thought they might be depressed and was interested in antidepressants, we wouldn't want to give them incentives not to talk to their doctor.\n\n&gt;If they want their guns, they'll try to get better as fast as they can.\n\nAs opposed to intentionally staying sick?\n\n&gt;Obviously, treatment can only go so far, but eventually, these things will be curable and the restriction would be temporary.\n\nSo they can hypothetically have their rights if the future works out a particular way?\n\n&gt;But, there are ways to protect your home without a gun. Australia seems to manage just fine.\n\nRight, but in Australia, the perpetrators can't buy guns like non-MI Americans would be able to.\n\n&gt;You keep using the term \"casual link\", would you mind defining that for me?\n\nCausal, not casual. As in, there is a cause from one to another, not just a correlation between the two.\n\n&gt;However, when talking about the \"mentally ill\", you tend to think of \n\nYes, tending to think of more violent conditions is the stigma I was talking about. Not knowing the definition of mental illness but assuming it means something psychotic is exactly what I'm arguing against.\n\n&gt;You mean when we've confirmed they are drunk?\n\nYes, my bad.\n\n&gt;There is much more risk with a mentally ill person getting a weapon than a drunk driver.\n\nThere is a much higher risk of being involved in a drunk-driving accident than being shot with by a person with a mental illness. 10,076 people died in drunk driving accidents in 2010 (http://responsibility.org/drunk-driving/drunk-driving-fatalities-national-statistics) compared to an estimated 1243 deaths from shootings where mental illness was the sole factor (http://smartgunlaws.org/gun-deaths-and-injuries-statistics/ , http://www.annalsofepidemiology.org/article/S1047-2797%2814%2900147-1/fulltext).\n\n&gt;The odds of a mentally ill person killing people is much higher than a normal person.\n\nAs I've responded to others here, if you control for factors besides mental illness, that difference almost entirely disappears:\n\n\"Evidence is clear that the large majority of people with mental disorders do not engage in violence against others, and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness.\" - direct quote from this study by the American College of Epidemiology (http://www.annalsofepidemiology.org/article/S1047-2797%2814%2900147-1/fulltext)\n\nThe figure that article gives is that only 4% of gun violence - if we assumed everything unaccounted for was the result of mental illness - could be attributed to mental illness alone."}, {"id": "2rbjbx", "body": "This argument is mainly about the association people have between mental illness and violence towards others.

While there is a slight correlation between mental illness and violence, most of this disappears if you control for factors that also make the general population more violent, such as a history of sexual abuse or drug use; furthermore, for some specific illnesses, like OCD, there is no reason to believe there will be a future of violence at all (yet this nuance is generally absent from public discussion).\n\n4. Most people have been biased to associate mental illness with violence by unfair media coverage. Most people would be outraged to read, as a last sentence in a story concerning gun violence, \u201cThe suspect is a Jew\u201d or \u201cThe perpetrator is reported to be homosexual\u201d; however, it\u2019s very common to find, despite it also being mainly a circumstance of birth/environment, \u201cThe suspect had a history of mental illness\u201d.

By that same logic, while we could almost certainly reduce the rate of gun violence by keeping all MI people away from all guns, this would be a violation of the Second Amendment rights of the MI who were in control enough not to commit violent acts.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Without them, some families would only fully assemble for funerals.\n\nIf you're going to gather that many people, it makes sense to throw a big party. It's reasonable to feed them good food. Have a venue big enough for all and a place to dance with good music. Some decoration sets the mood. It's easy to go overboard with all those things, partly a matter of diverging tastes, partly dumb traditions and social expectations.\n\nBut the core of weddings is a very good idea! It's the amplification and excess that wrecks it."}, {"id": "cnec5mx", "body": "I agree completely. The excessiveness of it all is what's lost on me.

But whoever is paying, it absolutely is important that whoever is doing the planning is realistic about the financial situations of whoever is contributing (be it themselves or others). And this is an area where many weddings go off the rails into dangerous territory.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way, and what I want to argue is that holding a once in a lifetime fancy party for friends and family isn't a ridiculous thing to do, provided you don't drive anyone into crippling debt.\n\nWhatever signfigance you happen to place on marriage, one of the defining characteristics for me is the merging of two families. My family and my wife's family were now connected. On top of that, our friends and families are scattered across the country. Getting as many people together as we can for any kind of event is kind of a big deal, and a really meaningful and exciting one. Weddings in general (ours and other family members') are pretty much the only time we get to see that much of our families together. So having some kind of celebration makes a lot of sense.\n\nWhy does it have to be so expensive? Well, there's a lot of people involved. Between my wife and I, we must have had 10+ sets of aunts and uncles, each of whom have adult children, a few sets of grandparents, plus our friends. Its not the kind of event that we can have in our apartment. And once you decide you want to get all these people together, you have to understand that many of them are flying a long way to be there, and so getting a nice dinner, some entertainment, and an open bar to me just felt like courtesy for the trouble they went through to be there.\n\nEnd result for us, everyone had an amazing time, and it was a hugely important event in our lives that we were able to share with everyone we loved.\n\nBut I have to again stress that all of this was contingent on us being able to pay for it, which we were, due to planning, saving, and shopping around. As wonderful as our wedding was, I in no way mean to give folks a carte blanche for spending exorbitant amounts money that they (or their parents) don't have. Be smart, but if you've got the money, I think its worth it if done right."}, {"id": "2rb4j5", "body": "My girlfriend is currently dealing with planning the wedding of an old friend of hers, and it is painful to watch.

Often times understanding why people do what they do can go a long way towards having compassion or empathy for another's experience, and I think the same is possibly true here, even if their decisions aren't necessarily decisions that you would make for yourself.\n\nPsychologically, the wedding is a right of passage that is a part of what it means to become an adult in many cultures. It's one of many cultural shifts that communicates that one now holds a different role in one's community and helps to codify what that new role is going to look like. In a way, you could argue that the wedding itself is a public declaration of the nature of the relationship between two people and where they intend for this relationship to go (or what they intend it to be) in the future. For this reason, it's easy to see the temptation created in making such a public declaration bold and powerful, because it tends to (for many different cultural reasons) be a part of who we are publicly and how we want others to see us.\n\nInterestingly, I run a therapy private practice where about half of the therapists are Marriage and Family Therapists, and there's a general consensus (though I looked for evidence online to see if this has been studied and couldn't find anything) that couples who have been together longer before getting engaged tend to have less expensive weddings than those who have been together for lesser time periods. You should take this with a grain of salt however, because I'm not providing direct data to support this, but intuitively it does seem to make sense and it's a trend that I've anecdotally noticed.\n\nThis would seem to suggest that perhaps, in some way, having a more expensive wedding, aside from being a display of wealth (related to the impression we want to create in others about the narrative for our relationship and where we see it going), serves the dual purpose for those who have been in relationships for a shorter periods of time of not only creating a display that convinces others of the veracity of the relationship, but also convinces the couple as well (who may well be relying more on hope for their marriage than actual experience and history with the other person).\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't work. Our own psychology often works against us and more expensive weddings are very predictive of marriages ending in divorce. This is seemingly obvious when you consider that money is one of the top things most couples fight about and going into a new marriage with a significant amount of debt really sets a couple up for this. \n\nInterestingly however, the size of the wedding (not the expense) is a hugely predictive factor of a successful marriage. This arguably reinforces the notion that having a public proclamation about your relationship in the form of a wedding does confer an advantage to your relationship. In situations, for instance, where over two hundred people attend attend a wedding, the couple is 92% less likely to divorce. Compare this to the statistical impact of a wedding that costs over $20,000, which raises the risk of divorce by 46%. There is an advantage to making the wedding an affair (no pun intended), but not an advantage to making it an expensive one.\n\nWhile none of this justifies an expensive wedding, and money certainly correlates with a less successful marriage, I think it can be helpful to remember that what these friends of yours are doing is about their struggle define themselves as a couple, and not about those of you who may be experiencing the collateral damage along the way. While that may not feel directly helpful, remember that it is always your choice to decide how you want to participate in this process of theirs. While they may be asking a lot of you, and they may be very prone in this situation to be making irrational decisions (as we all can be in the area of relationships), the choice on how to participate in this process is yours and yours alone.

While they may be upset or bothered by this, they then have choices about how they want to handle this. Will they allow you to buy a different dress? Will they contribute above and beyond what your budget is for the dress? Will you have to sit in the pews instead of a with the wedding party?

I think she feels that the wedding is forcing her to choose between her friend and her bank account, which has led me to feel the way I do about weddings in general. When she asked her mom about what to do, she said \"oh well [your friend] will pay you back at *your* wedding,\" which obviously doesnt equate if she has no plans to make her friend spend an equal amount of money."}, {"id": "cnecqou", "body": "&gt;I dont think it really alters the basis of my view though, which is that expensive weddings are pointless\n\nThat's just it. They're not pointless. They're not rational, but there is a point and an intention behind them. There is a function that having an expensive wedding serves for the couple doing it. You may disagree with it, you may dislike it, and it may have a potentially negative impact on the couple in the long run, but they are far from pointless.\n\nIn the same way that a bad piece of legislation always appears pointless if you don't hold the same political views as those who created it, your dislike for expensive weddings doesn't mean that they are without a point. They may not be a particularly successful way of achieving their intention, but that doesn't mean they don't have one.\n\nYour pain sounds mostly like it's about what your girlfriend is going through though. That's really the piece I was trying to address in my post. CMVs are often not about changing the totality of a person's view, but about tweaking a particularly troublesome aspect of it that helps the view itself either come together more cohesively or in a more nuanced manner, such that the original wording or statement in the post is no longer entirely valid.\n\nI would argue that your entire CMV isn't really about expensive weddings per se. If someone else was having one that you didn't know, it would probably be unlikely that you would be posting this. It also probably wouldn't matter as much to you if the couple was paying for everything themselves and your girlfriend wasn't getting dragged in this way. Your frustration is more directed at the implied expectation your gf is being subjected to as a part of her friendship with the couple being married.\n\nTo that end, sometimes you just have to (in as rational a manner as possible) apply some healthy boundaries in terms of what you're willing to do and what you're not. That doesn't mean there won't be conflict, but it puts the conflict back where it needs to be, which in this case is with the couple making demands of those in the wedding party.\n\nThe really tough part here is that you can't do that for your girlfriend. She has to do it herself and she may not be willing to. This may mean the best you can do is lend your ear and be supportive of her regardless of how she chooses to handle the situation. It sucks to watch people we love suffer, especially when we can do nothing to affect it directly. Being there for her will, in the long run, make a bigger difference than fixing it for her ever would anyway, and I get that none of this changes the situation, but hopefully it's helpful."}, {"id": "cnecqou", "body": "&gt;I dont think it really alters the basis of my view though, which is that expensive weddings are pointless\n\nThat's just it.

You did an excellent analysis of my post, and probably put the question better than I did. You're correct, my frustration is at the implication that, if she's a true friend, she will spend this money without question. This has been particularly frustrating because, as a guy, it seems like I dont really have to go through the same issues. Aside from renting a tux, there's not really much I'm expected to do, whereas she needs to buy a dress, shoes, get hair/makeup done, ect. This frustration is amplified by the fact that, as you again point out, I cant talk to her friend for her about this. I dont know the bride that well, and so my only vision of her is as a controlling, demanding bride who needs to be restrained for the sake of my gf's sanity. I do my best to be there, but I cannot help but be irked by the injustice of her implied obligation to a woman she isnt quite sure she views as a friend anymore.\n\nIt seems she's discovered this thread, so she may have some more to say on the subject.
