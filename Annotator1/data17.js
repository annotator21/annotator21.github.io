Political thinking greatly benefits from experience and observation and most people's political views *do* change over time as the mature. \n\nFor example you are 17. You (most likely) do not have to support yourself, work full time, invest for your retirement, raise children, or many of the other entirely normal things people will do in their lifetime. Actually experiencing those responsibilities first hand is going to greatly impact your political outlook. \n\n&gt;it usually means you have nothing more to say but aren't willing to \"lose\" this discussion to a stupid teen.\n\nPossibly. It may also mean that they are unable to convey to you what it's like to face certain situations because you are so far removed from them.\n\nWith regards to religion you're approaching an irrational topic rationally   which may very well be what your father is referring to. I don't know your dad but it's entirely possible that he doesn't *care* that there's no evidence for God but he enjoys the peace it brings him to believe there is order in the universe and (probably more importantly given your heritage) the kinship it brings him with the Jewish community. \n\nAs a side note my personal experience showed that vehement atheism (bordering on anti-theism) is *absolutely* a phase.

Relationship advice, for example. I've never been in a relationship so if I were to try and give an adult, or anyone for that matter, relationship advice, it would make sense to tell me \"you're too young\"/\"your opinion will change\"/\"you'll grow out of it\". \n\nbut when arguing about politics, religion, or any subject that really doesn't require experience to understand it better, saying something like \"you're just a teen\" or \"I used to think like that\" is an excuse and it usually means you have nothing more to say but aren't willing to \"lose\" this discussion to a stupid teen. \n\n personally I'm, unsurprisingly, an atheist. I come from a semi-religious Jewish family. me and my dad have this argument ALL THE TIME. you know the one. and it almost always ends with me bringing up an extremely valid point and him laughing and saying \"oh its just a phase. you're just a teen. you're so young. you have no idea.\" it fucking pisses me off. \n\nA teenager can argue about politics or religion just as well as a 25 year old can and just as well as a 50 year old can. it only depends on the person and how much they are willing to put into learning about the subject. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I remember it already bothering me when I was 8. \n\nAs a teenager, I think the problem I personally could have worked on myself was, that I was bad at listening to other arguments. I would have this idea/ideology in my head and be so convinced of it that no arguments could penetrate it (I had \"seen the light\"). I was stubborn as hell. Anyway.. Had I worked on that adults would probably (hopefully) have been more open to discussing stuff with me. Hell.. I could still work on my stubbornness.\n\nAnd often it *does* help to acknowledge that some people have a broader knowledge than you. Politics and ideologies are not inseperable from other aspects of life. You can not just study it, know the mechanics and the history of it and then necessarily know as much as someone older. Life experiences, travel, meeting different people and suffering different hardships will shape your view on the world and shape you as an individual. These experiences will help you apply your political knowledge to everyday life and maybe judge how different politics will affect you and the people around you. And not to mention.. Some adults you are talking to have all the same knowledge as you + some extra life experience.\n\nMind you, I am not saying that ALL adults are more politically intelligent than ALL teenagers. I don't care much for politics. A politically interested teen could probably out-debate me. I am just saying that on *average* adults probably have more knowledge about politics than teenagers. If for nothing else, then for time spend studying it.\n\nTry and reflect on how much you have changed and grown since you were 13. That process is not anywhere near done, as you probably know. Don't you see yourself being even more knowledgable in 8 years?\n\nI think people just remember how much they have grown and learned in that period of time (as it is almost a universal experience) and then translates it into something condescending because it is easier than to deal with your questions.\n\n**TL;DR**: Teenagers are of course capable of discussing politics and shouldn't be dismissed. But it is almost a universal experience that people get wiser as they get older (anything else would be sad, right?).\n\nP.S.: I hope I don't sound condescending in anything I am saying. English is not my first language and I am having a hard time Englishing tonight, so if anything sounds condescending, just know that it wasn't meant that way."}, {"id": "cncf29o", "body": "&gt; I so remember how annoying that was.

You can't be a \"law-abiding\" illegal immigrant. Infact, illegal immigrants don't pay taxes, that's how they avoid being identified as an illegal immigrant. Your presence as an illegal immigrant alone is \"illegal\", you can't be \"law-abiding\" in that situation. \n\nI for one agree with your perspective and agree that all immigrants should go through the proper process to receive citizenship. However, having known a Russian immigrant in college, I can tell you that the process is extremely drawn out and riddled with things that do not accurately test one's \"citizenship qualifications\". It is instead layered with questions related to American History (Which I doubt the average American knows) and an endless sea of paperwork and forms (Which I doubt the average American could complete).

There's other options than just citizenship that are on the table here, like permanent residency. Most if the discussion about undocumented immigrants seems to center more around whether we should even let them stay than whether we should give them citizenship. Are you opposed just to them receiving citizenship or do you think they should be deported? Adding to the confusion for me is that I'm not aware of quotas or anything that would have legal immigrants competing with undocumented immigrants if amnesty was given. The quotas are on immigration and permanent residency, to my understanding, and those likely would not be effected by an amnesty program. \n\nYou seem to think that undocumented immigrants have harmed you and other legal immigrants and have harmed the country. Which may be true, but you aren't considering the benefits they've brought to the US. They fill a role that Americans are unwilling to fill. They work for less than minimum wage in many cases, work jobs like migrant farm work that others are unwilling to work, etc. There's a reason why undocumented immigrants are stereotyped as working in construction, on farms, and in restaurant kitchens. It's work that citizens aren't willing to do for what they're being paid. There's a bit of an egg-chicken situation because many of those jobs pay so little because there's a large supply of undocumented immigrants, but citizens are just as capable of working under the table for below minimum wage as anyone else. The blame there, in my opinion, is on employers. And the fact that undocumented workers are easily exploited because they have no legal recourse. \n\nMany undocumented immigrants aren't working under the table, though. A lot of them are paying taxes, social security, etc.  They aren't the drain on our country that they're often portrayed to be. \n\nIt's also expensive to deport them. The process of catching, detaining, processing, and transporting illegal immigrants is not at all cheap, nor logistically simple. The US government already budgets for something like 400,000 deportations a year, which are costly and prioritize criminals. \n\nThere's also considerations like splitting up families. It's highly unethical, in my opinion, to deport undocumented immigrants with children who are citizens. The children have a right to be here, and can't be deported, so deporting their parents leaves them as wards of the state.\n\nSo, in my opinion, there's a solid case to be made that we shouldn't just be deporting undocumented immigrants. But if we don't, it's also not in our interest to just leave them undocumented. A whole mess of problems stem from having such a large undocumented population (problems better solved by amnesty than deportation). \n\nBut amnesty doesn't mean citizenship is necessary. Like I said above, residency is enough to solve many of the problems surrounding undocumented immigrants. Although, I don't know why you wouldn't give former undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship if it didn't effect other immigrants seeking citizenship.\n\n**TL;DR:** Of more concern than citizenship is permanent residency. This would give undocumented immigrants legal status and solve many of the problems surrounding undocumented workers. There's many reasons not to deport undocumented workers, including their positive impact on our economy and that deportation is expensive and complex.

The problem is that journalists at newspapers and news organizations in charge of scientific reporting generally take a fair amount of liberty when regurgitating science news. They take the original headline or content and give it a small to medium spin that makes it catchier to the average reader, and in many cases, clickbait. Even worse however, reputable articles are often used as a poisoned citation to make a case against scientific knowledge. Poorly worded articles serve as \"evidence\" of scientific conspiracies, collusion, and other nefarious made up bullshit.\n\nKnowing this, it should be standard practice for reputable publications to not put clickbait titles on their original articles, like the one above.\n\nLook at the word usage in this article:\n\n\"A new finding goes against dogma\"\n\nor the opening line...\n\n\"Open any introductory biology textbook and one of the first things you'll learn is that our DNA spells out the instructions for making proteins...\"\n\nInnocuous within the primary article, these types of lines are a single lazy step away from misleading, sham-journalism misrepresentation. I can practically read the title:\n\n\"Biologists defy established scientific dogma about role of DNA, textbooks proven wrong\"\n\nThat horrible title would be right there for the picking based on the first 5 seconds of reading this article. Given that most people who need a better understanding of science can't be bothered to read actually scientific articles, it's likely that the headline (or whatever garbage article it sits upon) is the only part that they will ingest. Its unlikely that they would actually go on to read the original article (if it is even posted.) So these people then read the title and go: \"typical scientists. Always changing their minds about everything.\"\n\n\nBy making the title and the first line or two rife with clickbait phrasing, they have given ammunition to individuals whose agenda is to sow mistrust in science. If the article had been called: \"New research finds amino acids can be assembled without DNA or RNA\", it would still have been *just* as interesting of a headline to the people who are actually reading stuff on phys.org. They could've even put the whole textbook thing somewhere in the article. That way, it's still in there, and any sham journalist would at least have to go digging to find that.\n\nWhile I focused pretty specifically on this one article, I have almost never seen the term used in a way that is championing the process. People in science know that textbooks are bound to the information at the time of their printing (book pun), and so textbooks being upended is nothing to get huffed at. Science is always revising itself.\n\nBut for people who don't have a good understanding of science, the notion of these sacred textbooks being proven wrong generally resonates negatively with them. A lot of these readers either have their own sacred, infallible books, (religious right agenda) or have an axe to grind against established science (new age-y leftist agenda).\n\nOverall, I think the term needs to be used extremely carefully, and when it is used, it should be presented in a positive light, as it is a critical part of the scientific method. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Connery's acting quality declined over the years.**\n\nHis first three performances (Dr. No, From Russia With Love and Goldfinger) were excellent.

Even at the old age of 57, Moore was in good shape and had his heart in the role.  For Craig, Quantum of Solace was considered a weak film, but his acting in it was acclaimed.  \n\n**2. Connery's portrayal of the character didn't eclipse the other actors**\n\nTo say that Connery \"IS James Bond\" or that he's the definitive one would suggest that his role was basically a complete exhaustive interpretation of everything 007 could ever be.  The fact that 007 became a franchise for 40 years after Connery proved that he wasn't the only one who could move the character.\n\nEach of the other actors brought something new to the table.  Lazenby's Bond was human, emotional and empathetic.  Moore's Bond did plenty of new outrageous creative things which gave him his own fan base.  Dalton's dark primal take on Bond was a dramatic shift as well.  Brosnan established himself as a refined modern man, as well as a suave gentleman.  And Craig re-invented Bond as a vulnerable soul who rises above his troubles.\n\n**3. Connery's portrayal of the character wasn't accurate to the books.**\n\nConnery's interpretation of Bond misses the point of the books.\n\nWith Fleming's books, the emphasis was less about who the character of James Bond was, and moreso the feeling you get when you read about his adventures.  Unlike Connery's performance which deliberately sought out to make Bond himself the most interesting part.\n\nBond is a manifestation of Fleming's desires.  Bond doesn't womanize because he's fun.  He womanizes because there's a void in his heart and he can't hold a relationship.  Bond smokes and drinks to alleviate his stress.  Bond kills because he has to.  Connery established Bond as a guy every man wanted to be, but we don't want to be Fleming's Bond.\n\nConnery was partly responsible for making the series so popular.  There is nothing wrong with Bond being interpreted liberally.  I have no problem with Moore defusing a bomb in a clown suit, so I have no problem with Connery having a sugarcoated Bond either.  The problem is when a certain sect of Connery's fanbase asserts the Connery is the true James Bond, when he is just an interpretation.  Moore was honest that his portrayal was goofy, whereas with Connery there was a pretense that he was actually the character.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This leads to the trait that a lot of people have, where they find what they think is the \"root\" cause of many problems. You will see it in feminist saying that the economy's trouble is because we don't take advantage of half our workforce, basic income supporters saying the economy's troubles are from forcing people to work for their survival, for race movements it's because of their inequality. Groups tend to use this to push their own agenda and show how their solution to \"the\" problem helps everyone. It is impossible to attack that point because the complexity makes it hard to prove that the issue is not the primary cause, and the issue probably has some impact on the problem. It also pushes the burden of proof on the opponents of the movements rather than the movement itself.\n\nFor you, it appears that the root cause for all of those things (not sure about the football concussion thing though) is economic equality. But where you say education reform is futile while we have economic disparity, education reformist would say that the economic disparity is because we aren't educating our lower classes correctly and say that economic reform is futile until we fix the problems with educating our future generations. \n\nYour view is entirely based on economic disparity being the cause of the other problems. But the system is complex with no clear cause, you can point out examples of your case only to have a dozen opposing views/ examples of causation thrown back.

The hopeful trend of convergence brought about by fast emerging-market growth from 2000 to 2007 has reversed:https://www.credit-suisse.com/upload/news-live/000000022801.pdf Emerging markets, while creating a ton of GDP, are not converting much of that to wealth and the US has actually *increased* its share of global wealth since 2007, with all of that going to the top. As a result, the average human being is poorer now than she was in 2010, even though global income and wealth as an aggregate have increased substantially. The median American is poorer than the median Canadian or even Italian and is at about the same wealth level as a Portuguese, a South Korean, or a Western Slav. Chillingly, much of Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel are following on the same track.\n\nIt is easy to see the links between high inequality and low mobility in the US, as well as increasing global inequality that is wiping out the gains China and other emerging countries made in the 2000-2007 period, and various US and international problems.\n\nPolice brutality has proven to be among the most effective wedge issues keeping desperate black and Hispanic Americans from solidarity with slightly less desperate white Americans.\n\nGun control has repeatedly been blocked by desperate white Americans voting in the Tea Party, by mistrust of the government, and, as Obama pointed out in 2008, clinging to firearm ownership as one of their few sources of power. At the same time, highly-armed but equal societies like Switzerland and Iceland have far less gun violence (and non-gun violence) than the US.\n\nEducation reform is futile when 20-30% of the American population is struggling to make ends meet and 70%+ are one unlucky break or bad decision away from misery. At the same time, many Americans are not seeing any return in education and are taking out tens of thousands in student loans only to work at Starbucks or McDonald's. If the sons and daughters of the USA's white upper-middle-class are struggling to stay afloat, what does that say about the chances and return on investment for the white working class, much less blacks and Hispanics in the inner cities?\n\nAmerican football will forever retain a steady pipeline of recruits so long as poor blacks, Hispanics, and rural folk see no path to college or wealth other than combat sports. Many parts of the US see gridiron football as their main lifeline and source of charity and economic activity.\n\nEurope has long been spared the extremes of capitalism in the American style; however, the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in parties left, right, and center in countries with credit ratings from AAA to junk making cuts in government programs and benefits that would have been political suicide just one decade earlier. This phenomenon has spread to Canada, Australia, and even New Zealand and Japan and in the Northern countries is accompanied by a housing bubble in major cities that results in crippling household-debt-to-GDP ratios, years of \"hidden homelessness\" and couch-surfing in cities like Stockholm, and near-US-like levels of wealth inequality. With no mainstream politicians willing to reject austerity, this Great Americanization has been a boon to far-left and far-right parties, including close allies of Vladimir Putin, as well as to conversions to radical Islam.\n\nThe situation in Israel is similar. Ultranationalism has become a handy distraction from Israelis' day-to-day problems and antipathy that should be directed at the elite is instead being directed at the Palestinians. At the same time, the rise of radical Islamic groups such as ISIS that make the Taliban and al-Qaeda look like teddy bears has colored a lot of the anti-Palestinian and anti-Arab rhetoric, as have alliances of convenience with ex-neo-Nazis in the European far right.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That being the examples you give outline the underlying cultural issues that lead to economic inequality. Economics is a numbers game, economic inequality is a product of a collection of cultural issues.  \n\nSidenote: economic inequality is also inevitable in all economies(yes even communism), human nature and the will to better one's life will not allow for economic inequality to ever go away. It can however get better.  \n\n&gt; Police brutality has proven to be among the most effective wedge issues keeping desperate black and Hispanic Americans from solidarity with slightly less desperate white Americans  \n\nI would have to disagree with you that this has anything to do with income inequality. The militarization of the police force, the US vs THEM mentality, and the lack of accountability are the main causes of police brutality. All of which can be traced to the cultural issue of disliking, misjudging, and mistreating those that are different( The same thinking that leads to economic inequality).  \n\n&gt; Gun control has repeatedly been blocked by desperate white Americans voting in the Tea Party, by mistrust of the government, and, as Obama pointed out in 2008, clinging to firearm ownership as one of their few sources of power. At the same time, highly-armed but equal societies like Switzerland and Iceland have far less gun violence (and non-gun violence) than the US  \n\nI am not sure how you are connecting this to income inequality. Gun control is a very politicized issue that doesn't address the real problem with guns in America. Why are people in America killing each other more often than in other western countries? Income inequality is not an answer to that question. The hate in the country for those who are different does.  \n(The Switzerland/Iceland argument is also rather irrelevant in general  considering the countries have a COMBINED population of around 8.4 million people with far less diversity than the USA).  \n\n&gt; Education reform is futile when 20-30% of the American population is struggling to make ends meet and 70%+ are one unlucky break or bad decision away from misery. At the same time, many Americans are not seeing any return in education and are taking out tens of thousands in student loans only to work at Starbucks or McDonald's.\n\nThat is a very good point, and the education system in the US is very flawed. However fixing income inequality will do nothing to fix the school systems. Fixing the school systems, and reducing student debt will help close the wage gap and ease the income inequality. Also, with the growing technology in the country, education in high schools will (hopefully) get better and the idea that people MUST go to college or they are not smart/job capable will dissipate. Which will also ease the wage gap.  \n\n&gt; American football will forever retain a steady pipeline of recruits so long as poor blacks, Hispanics, and rural folk see no path to college or wealth other than combat sports.

There's this kind of *\"moral disgust\"* for things which don't inherently do any harm.

The reason is this: heroin is currently socially unacceptable and a very uncommon drug. The 2% who are doing it now _despite those social stigmas_ are probably more risk-taking, impulsive, antisocial, less health-conscious, etc than the average person. People with these traits are more likely to become dependent, so they bring the dependency rate up. That rate of dependency is basically selecting for people who are more likely to become drug-dependent than the average person.\n\nConversely, almost everyone has used alcohol. So the population of alcohol users not only includes the same types of anti-social risk-takers that use heroin, but also people with average and above average risk-aversion and impulse control.

Is it really the drug that is causing the problem, or is it the person's behaviour? It's clearly the latter, since the drug is just a powder extracted from a plant, it's not inherently problematic. It's *connected* to problems, but that's not to say it directly causes them. Is addiction the culprit? Not necessarily, as being addicted to something doesn't harm anyone but the addict, and only when the addict chooses to perform antisocial actions to feed their addiction. Addiction is not even a socially devastating event in any case; plenty of cigarette smokers attest to the prevalence of benign addiction in our society. If heroin were not illegal it would cost pennies to feed a habit, meaning an addict would not have to rob or steal. If the argument is then that the intoxication leads to antisocial activities keep in mind that, again, we have plenty of intoxicating activities in our society (alcohol is the big one) and the moral fabric has not degraded to a point where we have been ruined by it. We are adults and we can choose appropriate times and places for intoxication. We forbid intoxication when it can be societally dangerous (driving, operating machines) and morally abhor it when we feel it is inappropriate (around children, etc).\n\nThere is no rational reason for us to condone some drugs and forbid others, only moral habit, ingrained by culture. Some people in the world have a greater propensity for self-destruction than others, and these people often turn to drugs to escape life and hurt themselves. This is up to them, as they are adults and they can do as they choose.

When you throw in a sexual component, there is no possible free consent - the same reason that there are taboos and laws against teachers or doctors having relationships with those in their care.\n\nEven with siblings, we have the problem that if they break up, it will unquestionably weaken the family.  (Whose side do you take, who do you support, who is welcome at home?).  Since the family is the first line of support for caregiving, financial or other help, weakening the family increases the likelihood that the state will need to help out.\n\nSo, I agree - if you want to be gay, have an orgy, smoke moderate amounts of pot - things that really only affect you, go for it.

The person smoking weed is more than likely fueling border conflicts between the Mexican government and drug cartels that have killed hundreds or even thousands of people and destabilized an entire region of Mexico.

Acts either used to fund the addiction, like robbery, or acts that come about from the addiction, like drunk driving. You're saying we shouldn't punish the drug use but the resulting acts of harm, which I'm calling reactive. You're not trying to prevent harm, you're trying to punish harm. But by doing so, you're allowing these 5 acts of harm to happen. Preventative measures would be to stop the harm before it happens, in this case by making the drug use itself illegal. You prevent the 5 acts but by criminalizing an act that doesn't cause direct harm. In this situation, the net positive of preventing harm is considered to outweigh the negatives of criminalizing the harmless. You're valuing the collective over the individual. \n\nThere's also something to be said of the health of a society, which can greatly be effected by victimless crimes. That, however, is super subjective (some people think gay marriage harms society while others think it improves it, for instance), so I won't really go into it.

Get outta other peoples bidness, nigga damn......\n\nBut logical can be defined another way, and stigmas and stereotypes and whatnot do serve a purpose in survival, albeit a primitive one that cognitive thinking should eliminate. The logic, if you will, is that your brain takes in more stimuli than it can process at pretty much all times your eyes are open and its constantly looking to make connections it can rely on to evaluate the situation quickly. So if you see someone who looks threatening or has some other known facet of themselves that threatens your way of life and potential survival, your brain makes the connection rapidly so it can focus on the other parts of the equation, and it looks for ways to reinforce that belief before looking for reason to doubt it. It also works this way when you see someone who shares similar traits as yourself and its called \"tribe mentality\". In the diverse world we live in today, this mechanism has an increasing amount of downsides, but none the less it tends to keep ya safe when faced with the person(s) in question, and its worked out for the benefit of the individual thinking these things more than not in the history of mankind. \n\nFor what its worth, though, I agree. And I've also noticed a correlation that this trait is more prevalent the less adversity someone's seen. Like the less real and heavy survival threats someone has faced, the more they seem to make threats out of situations where there isn't one. If someone else lives differently than me, whoever it is, I dont give a shit what you do with your time or life or whatnot until it has a direct effect on me, and my first instinct is to separate myself from the situation or the consequence before thinking one of us is wrong. But that's cuz I've faced a shit load of real survival threats, like homelessness, starvation and physical attacks, so its engrained in me that someone else's choices dont really effect me until they negatively and directly effect my safety, job security, bank account or that of those I care about. Some people haven't had it proven what is and isn't a real threat in their lifetime. "}]}
