Edit 3 basically perfectly describes the whole situation.\n\n\nI really wanna talk more about this. Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:\n\n1. You're screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don't wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\n\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw.

A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I'm just getting really tired, I was pretty tired in the first place and didn't expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets.

This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets.

However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I'm just getting really tired, I was pretty tired in the first place and didn't expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students.

My parents told me after I graduated that if I wanted to go to college without paying, I should have done well enough to get a scholarship.

He now works at a printing shop making $10.50 per hour.  My sister works as a secretary for $9.50 per hour.  I make good money and made something of myself, but it was a long, hard road to hoe.  My siblings did not go to college even though they are both very intelligent, and I definitely believe that government funds would have been much better spent on their college than a bunch of people that I know that only went because it was free.  \n\nI love my parents, and they were always good to us besides spending money.

Edit 3 basically perfectly describes the whole situation.\n\n\nI really wanna talk more about this. Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:\n\n1. You're screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don't wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\n\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don't. \"You just got that money because you're poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\n\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\n\n**Edit:** Well, I've only had reasons added to my list.\n\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\n\n5. To go with that, a student has no control over their parents, and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.\n\n6. To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I'm just getting really tired, I was pretty tired in the first place and didn't expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Therefore, if you as an adult are poor, you as an adult should be seen as poor to the government.

Edit 3 basically perfectly describes the whole situation.\n\n\nI really wanna talk more about this. Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:\n\n1. You're screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don't wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\n\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don't. \"You just got that money because you're poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\n\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\n\n**Edit:** Well, I've only had reasons added to my list.\n\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\n\n5. To go with that, a student has no control over their parents, and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.\n\n6. To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I'm just getting really tired, I was pretty tired in the first place and didn't expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Edit 3 basically perfectly describes the whole situation.\n\n\nI really wanna talk more about this. Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:\n\n1. You're screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don't wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\n\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don't. \"You just got that money because you're poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\n\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\n\n**Edit:** Well, I've only had reasons added to my list.\n\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\n\n5. To go with that, a student has no control over their parents, and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.\n\n6. To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot.

I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students.

This is idiotic for a multitude of reasons.\n\n**1. It makes the game less fun.**\n\nWould you want to play Mario Kart without items? Fuck no. That removes all of the excitement and variation in the game. Same applies to Smash.\n\nSure enough, there was a post in r/nintendo or r/wiiu last week asking if there could be a competitive Mario Kart scene and most of the responses were \"not unless they remove items\". But then what's the point? Where's the fun? Just play another goddamn racing game if you want to play Mario Kart without items and just play another goddamn fighting game if you want to play Smash Bros. without items.\n\nEDIT: This part of my view has been changed.\n\n**2. It's restricting the intended purpose of the game.**\n\nWhy would you remove features from the game that are meant to be used? You're taking the game and making it into something it's not. It's like deliberately ordering a supreme pizza and picking off all the ingredients. Fucking pointless and borderline disrespectful to the developers (I'll admit this last part is a bit dubious, but, well...they did work to put it in the game as a main function of the game and it makes up a good portion of their creative output. It's kinda lame to just ignore that aspect of it).\n\nEDIT: This part of my view has also been changed.\n\n**3. Not only do items not hinder the competitive aspect of the game; they add to it, making their restriction the hindrance.**\n\nThis is the big one. This is why competitive Smash players leave items off in the first place: Because \"the random aspect makes the game less competitive\". Um...how? I mean, I guess the justification is that the randomness of item types and placement reduces the focus on the players' abilities, but to that I say two things:\n\n**3A. No, it doesn't remove focus on players' abilities.**\n\nDo you not even consider that, y'know, the person who gets the item still has to use it *correctly*? And you can still dodge it? And, assuming the item doesn't spawn right next to a player, you still have to make the dash to the item before someone else ***OR*** decide not to go for it at all. This is where the game becomes *more* competitive with the use of items. You have to actually take them into account. I imagine a common argument against items is something like \"oh well you suck if you can only win with items on.\" Have you considered that maybe *you* suck because you can't win without them turned off?\n\nI guess what I'm saying here is that while items add a slight element of chance, they more than make up for it with a multiple separate aspects of player skill.\n\n**3B. Even if there is a random aspect to the game...so what?**\n\nIt's not as though it's a coin toss or a lottery where it's based entirely on luck. It's just the kinds of items and where they're placed. The addition of luck is part of the fun *and* part of the challenge.\n\nLuck and competition are not mutually exclusive. Even with items turned off. It's not even possible for them to be. There's always going to be the possibility of an otherwise champion player making a stupid, fatal fuckup, or a glitch in the game causing an otherwise unwarranted victory. I understand wanting to reduce that element of chance, but removing items does so to the point that the fun in the competition is lost.\n\nAt the very least, there should be separate, mainstream Smash tournaments that keep items on.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you haven't seen it already, watch the smash documentary.\n\nSmash plays very differently to other fighting games. For a lot of people it is, on a base mechanical level, a lot more fun than Street Fighter or Tekken. When I play smash personally, it's 4+ players with items on high. But when I'm watching a smash tournament I wouldn't want anything but 1v1 no items.\n\nNow I'm not against randomness in competitive games. I love poker. But in that case, the random element is essential to the game. In the case of smash, it's entirely optional. The comparison to mario kart also isn't great as that game doesn't have mechanics to make it incredibly deep on a competitive level.\n\nAdded randomness needs to add more to the experience than it takes away. We've established that what it adds is pretty subjective, but it would demonstrably be taking away by artificially helping the worse player.

Keeping the nerves down comes with experience, however there is no amount of experience that can prevent some of the random unavoidable deaths that items can cause.\n\nI see what you're trying to say about the items adding another layer to the competitive nature of the game, but I just don't agree. You can be the best in the world and one lucky item drop can cost you the game.

Pokemon has several random elements. Damage, critical hits, secondary effects, and accuracy.  It still has a large competitive scene.  The difference is that players often have some control over these elements (accuracy boosting moves, increasing attack so that you can ko even without getting lucky on the damage rng, etc).  Even so,  most competitive players frown on strategies that become too random, like spamming evasion moves or putting the whole team to sleep.  This is mostly because it makes the game almost purely random for one player while not for the other (which is unfair)\n\nIt's not merely the presence of random elements that is bad for a competitive scene, it's random elements that the players cannot affect *and* that confer unfair advantages.

Many of the weapons don't even need to be used and are more effective just as projectiles, which biases the game play way towards long range combat no matter what characters are being used.

Here the playing is the fun part. I call it \"the first way\" 2) Matches where you try to have fun by trying hard and getting engaged in the competition. I call it \"the second way\". This is more of a rough feeling than a good definition, so I hope you understand what I'm trying to get at. \n\nProblems occur when people wanting different things out of the game play at the same time, and item preference is usually a good indicator of which of the two games you want to play. \n\nThe main point I think you're wrong about is 3A. And to be clear, I think my argument only applies in cases where someone wants to play the second kind of game. Hypothetically there was an item that spawned, that caused the game to end and whoever grabs it wins immediately. If you wanted to have fun the second way, wouldn't this item make you really sad every time it spawned? You were really being rewarded by how you've played, and then suddenly it was over because this spawned closer to one of you. Even if you won with it, wouldn't it be kind of hollow?\n\nWhile this hypothetical item is ridiculous, it illustrates that the problem isn't necessarily that you won or lost, its that it changed what the game was about. League of legends has a similar problem if you play at all. If one champion, build, or strategy is so powerful that each team is required to play it or be at a big disadvantage, it can make the game stale because other strategies might be more fun for some players. The item problem is similar. It's also compounded by players who have spent a fair amount of time trying to get competitive.\n\nI enjoy trying to figure out the interactions between my particular fighter and my opponent's. If the items had more counterplay then I think you might be right. But most of the time, the most important thing is \"who's closer to the better spawning items\".\n\n\n\nTo give a more relevant example: at the upper levels of play in smash, frequently there's a problem that defensive play is considered very strong. It's usually to your advantage to stay away from your opponent and wait for him to overextend or make a move that causes him to become vulnerable. This isn't as fun to participate in, and makes it more boring to watch too. The big Nintendo sponsored tournament before the smash 4 release ended in one player basically avoiding all conflict when he got mildly ahead. It was a huge bummer. If you literally can't get to the item first because of where it spawned it's unfun: most items either inspire even MORE defensive play, or the item can break through any defense and it has no counterplay. \n\nIf the items were differently balanced and provided more counterplay I might agree. If I were thinking of rebalancing it, I'd consider having a spot that spawned items in random intervals that is quite difficult to defend. Players would have to choose between being more likely to get the item and putting themselves at a disadvantage until it spawned.\n\nDoes that make sense, or do I need to explain something better?"}, {"id": "2r6a86", "body": "It's standard in the competitive Smash Bros. community to only play the game with items off.

You still have to do fighting without items while items aren't in play, just like all the players in Quidditch have to still score goals and dodge bludgers.\n\nThe argument was just there to demonstrate that different game elements impact each other.\n\n&gt; I guess this is true, but it's not like they just stop mattering entirely, and it's not like this makes the game any less competitive. It just adds weight to other elements.\n\nBut game elements are not created equally, some are more interesting and deep than others, and games with prominent deep elements are those that often become the best competitive games.\n\nGrabbing a Bob-omb that spawned near you isn't a difficult task, and there's little depth to explore with that element. If more emphasis is put on it, it makes the other elements less worthwhile.\n\n&gt; Do you mean that most games end with the snitch being caught?\n\nLet's just ignore the one game where the snitch resulted in a loss, it was silly and kind of irrelevant. For all intents and purposes, catching the snitch as soon as you could resulted in a win, regardless of the score. There were never more than 14 goals scored in one match.\n\nThroughout the series, emphasis is placed on getting the snitch as fast as possible. Aside from bludger influence, every single game that Harry played in would have ended exactly the same had the rest of the team not even have existed. He went for the snitch as quickly as possible, and got it as soon as he could, winning the game. There was never a point where the other team was ahead and he had to guard the snitch from being caught or something.\n\nA strong game element detracts from the rest of the game. Let me put some numbers down and see if this explanation works. Suppose Smash was composed of two elements, positioning and timing. Competitive Smash fans love these elements, since there are a lot of possibilities to explore. Let's quantify them as such:\n\nPositioning: 50%  \nTiming: 50%\n\nNow you add items to the game. Let's say they're important enough to decide 30% of the game. Now we have this:\n\nPositioning: 35%  \nTiming: 35%  \nItems: 30%\n\nItems are very random, and don't have a very high skill ceiling. In the case of a Bob-omb, the skill ceiling is \"grabbing it\", and then the throwing part is harder, but there's no penalty for failure. If you miss, you miss. There's no more depth to explore here. But look at what happened to the other two game elements? They don't matter as much because items have a bigger impact on the game.\n\nCompetitive players want to play the positioning and timing game, since they're deep, fun elements that have an incredibly high skill ceiling. Hell, the things that expert players manage still impress us. Items don't have that capacity and make those elements matter less, much like the snitch makes all of the other players matter less."}, {"id": "cnda0qg", "body": "&gt; Sure, but the Smash Ball is a very dominant element that diminishes everything else.\n\nSure it is. That doesn't mean it requires any less skill to use it.\n\nThe skill is in getting the Smash Ball. The advantage the player has when they have the Smash Ball is deserved when the player exercised their skill in getting the Smash Ball, in the first place.\n\nI still don't really get the Quidditch analogy, mainly because I don't see that as an issue, either.

That said, I think \"5 seconds\" is an understatement and I think you know it, even for a single smash ball, and its common for more than one to appear over the course of a game.\n\nBut its not just a time factor. Sure, you can measure the game in time, but in a competitive sense, a more useful metric is damage done. And even if the smash ball is only present for 5% of the game time, it's likely to end up representing a WAY higher percentage of the total damage done.\n\nBut maybe we should take a different track for the discussion. I'm fascinated about the extent to which you've defended quidditch in the your other responses.

Wavedashing, perfect shielding, crouch canceling, SHFFLing, and more all take more skill than items.  They, however, do not use luck (which items obviously do).

Super Smash Bros with no items is a 100% skill-based matchup and there's a lot of appeal to this kind of game from a competitive standpoint. If your goal is to goof around and have fun then the luck aspect isn't such a big deal but if your goal is to determine who is the better player then allowing lucky events to tip the scales is only going to leave players and audiences with doubts. How can you claim that player X is better than player Y when an invincibility star happened to spawn next to him at a critical moment in the match?\n\n&gt;There's always going to be the possibility of an otherwise champion player making a stupid, fatal fuckup, or a glitch in the game causing an otherwise unwarranted victory.\n\nIf you make a fuckup then that's 100% on you. Mistakes aren't luck, they're a natural part of a contest of skill. Glitches tend to be well-documented with available workarounds and even if an unexpected glitch occurs tournament officials can intervene as necessary."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2r5o9o", "body": "I forget where I first learned this but it has stuck with ever since and as person who deals with graphs and plots all the time (biochemist) it drives me nuts when ever I hear it.\n\nThe term \"learning curve\" has been used in science since the early 1900s (according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve)).

I think it's an important distinction. You may learn the complex mechanics but not be proficient enough to implement them.

Later on, you watch a pro play it, you learn some of their tricks, some of the nuances of the character, but you still are nowhere near as proficient as the pro player.

You haven't defined the units, or explained why that value shoots up so high. I would content, that for a casual game, the amount learned would be far lower than a complex one.

Dark Souls is hard and has a steep learning curve because there's a *lot* that you need to know and you need to know it right away or you're going to die a lot.

Dark Souls is hard and has a steep learning curve because there's a *lot* that you need to know and you need to know it right away or you're going to die a lot. Like climbing up the hill, it's a slow and arduous process, and if it's steep enough, you may even find yourself falling back it a bit and climbing up a different way.\n\nPerhaps a better example would be most 4x games (like the Civilization series). Imagine instead of plotting out information learned over time, you're plotting out what \"tier\" of skill you're in vs how much stuff you need to learn to reach that tier. So in civ, you can play the lowest difficulty not knowing really anything about the game, but once you jump around in the higher difficulties you need to know how to micromanage *everything* in the game (and there are a lot of things), so that graph would be much steeper than, say a simple platformer.\n\nThis definition is pretty much the only one I've ever heard used, but I will admit, the only time I've ever heard it used is in regards to video games. Also, they tend to look more like an exponential graph than the examples you provided.

"}, {"id": "cncnikt", "body": "I feel there is a bit of a contradiction in your view. I think that this part of your view:\n\n&gt; I'm talking about research/design/programming/IT/call center jobs, where you aren't in the public eye or aren't representing the company with your physical body. If you're going and making house calls as an IT guy then this doesn't apply.\n\nUndermines this part of your view:\n\n&gt; I don't believe that wearing a collared shirt and pants that aren't jeans are representative that you \"respect\" the job any more than I believe that sweatpants and a t-shirt are signs that you disrespect the job.\n\nI mean, if this you truly believe that clothing does not reflect anything about an employee's attitude then why should you be concerned about whether or not those employees are interacting with customers? If there is absolutely no connection between clothing choices and professionalism then it should be perfectly fine for an employee dressed in jeans and a tee-shirt to make a house call.\n\nYet you are willing to concede that clothing choice has a strong enough impact on customers that there could be negative implications if employees don't adhere to a certain standard. Shouldn't you also be willing to accept that these kinds of negative implications could take place in an internal setting, given that the employees of your company were often raised in a similar (or the same) society that the customers grew up in?\n\nI think that it ultimately comes down to the fact that the company has more reason for asking you to dress a certain way than simply representing the company. That is certainly one reason why they would create a dress code, but there are others as well. Establishing an environment of professionalism and productivity is crucial for a business to be successful, and the way that individuals dress impacts the general atmosphere of an environment pretty heavily . \n\nFor instance, if I am attending a wedding and I am dressed in jeans and a tee-shirt while everone else is dressed in a suit and tie, I am going to feel uncomfortable - at a wedding this would not have much of an impact except making me feel out of place. But it can be argued that feeling uncomfortable in a work environment would likely lower a person's productivity which is a relevant factor to an employer. \n\nAs a side note, I am also interested to know what you think would be a fair way to qualify what does and doesn't fall under the category of 'offensive'."}, {"id": "cncv42h", "body": "&gt;Establishing an environment of professionalism and productivity is crucial for a business to be successful, and the way that individuals dress impacts the general atmosphere of an environment pretty heavily . \n\nAnecdote to add to this, because I think it is very true. In my high school Mock Trials class, we had to dress up during trials. Full suit and tie. The teacher gave us one day to dress casual, as an experiment, and she had been doing so all her years teaching the class. Every single time, the productivity decreased significantly, and much less work was done. Same class, same students.

It was just obvious to everyone that there was much less effort and professionalism during the casual day, and the trial moved along much slower than usual. I agree it isn't a perfect experiment, but I think it does count for something. \n\nI would love to wear whatever I want to work, but at the same time I believe that the \"look good, feel good\" mentality carries over into this as well.

And her ham was odd, because she chopped off the end bit. People always asked her why she did it, and she told them \"Well, my mother did it that way, and she taught me, so I do it that way.\" When she once asked her mother, her mother's answer was \"Well, your grandmother taught me, and so that's how I always did it.\" so she asks her grandmother, and her grandmother says \"Our first Christmas, your grandfather brought home a ham that was *holds out hands a distance apart* this big, but the oven in that damn small apartment was *holds hands closer* this big.\"\n\nSo, my contention is that we are the granddaughter in this situation: we are doing something pointless, adding in an extra step, where it doesn't need to be, because \"it's always been that way\" is idiotic, and not something we should put up with.

Once that baseline is established, typically some occasional variation is allowable as long as no one abuses the privilege. Dress codes also serve the purpose of creating a specific and universal set of rules, which alleviates the need of having to individually address each and every employees personal interpretation of what is or isn't acceptable. As a manager, I don't want waste time arguing with an employee or my boss over whether their definition of \"naughty bits\" is the same as mine, so I set a dress code of slacks and a button up shirt and avoid the problem altogether. These are a few of the many benefits that an employer may find in dress codes. They may not be benefits *you* care about, but they are benefits none the less.\n\nFrom am individual perspective, dressing up a bit **does** change the way people perceive and treat you. The company I currently work for has a set dress code: Black, logo monogrammed polo and slacks. I never fucking wear that polo. From years of experience I've learned that if you're wearing a logo'd polo shirt people treat you like the hired help, but if you wear a button up shirt and a tie (even an oversized, untucked button up) they treat you like someone who can get things done for them. The difference is stunning. I've gotten more raises than my peers, better gigs, more compliments and client recommendations, etc, etc. You might not believe that this should be the case, but it is. Dressing to impress is a thing, it works, and you should do it whenever you get the chance. This is a clear and definite benefit. Dressing up a bit also changes how you feel about yourself, it can increase your confidence,\n\nYou aren't going to find any clear evidence that dress codes have a universal benefit, because they don't, nothing does. Some companies may find that a relaxed dress code increases moral, for others it may lead to lower productivity. As with everything their are benefits and detriments a plenty that will manifest themselves in accordance with the other variables that influence any group of people.

And that's part of why dress codes are in place in the first place. Plenty of people, men and women, need to have \"appropriate\" spelled out to them. By codifying what \"appropriate\" means in that context the employer democratizes the employees so that they can understand the standards they are being held to clearly. \n\nThis helps for recent immigrants. Some nations are very formal and said employees might be spending more than they need to having clothing dry-cleaned and pressed in order to meet a standard that doesn't exist here. Other nations are very informal, and someone might be surprised to learn that showing up in shorts, t-shirt and flip-flops isn't considered OK. \n\nFurther, it stops employees with differing values from having clashes over those values in the work space. No manager wants to deal with some employee who isn't dressing appropriately for the culture but who believes they are: be it some guy with ass-crack hanging out all over the place or some gal who doesn't know her C-cup breasts need more than B-cup worth of coverage in the office. Codification serves to set the bar, establish a clear standard, and put everyone on the same page. \n\nThat way, valuable workers don't have to spend their valuable time creating unnecessary office tensions over clashing cultural understandings about what is appropriate and what is not.

Universities responded to this by creating enormous humanities departments, passing any kid who has a pulse, handing them a piece of useless paper after 4 years and expecting them to fend for themselves with a huge debt and no marketable skills. This has created a generation of baristas with huge debts and nothing to show for it, making it way harder for them to get ahead in life than it would have been if they never went to university in the first place. This is a terrible waste of tax resources. Governments need to start demanding a certain percentage of students get placed, and if universities can't do that, they shouldn't receive any funding, their students should be barred from receiving government loans, and the schools should be forced to close as a result (or exist only to serve the very rich who can afford to piss away $100k without developing marketable skills).

Also, there's a major \"you can drag a horse to water\" problem.\n\n1) Too Few Students: According to BLS data of occupations in the U.S., a big school like the University of Washington (over 40,000 students, so roughly 10,000 graduates per year, just to keep the math easy) would have to graduate 2890 Business Majors every year. (And I explicitly excluded every position that could be performed by someone without a degree, like non-accounting clerical positions and sales staff - but those folks could probably benefit from a degree, too.) Reverse engineer that to the overall pool and you've got 11,560 Business majors taking all the various levels of courses. UW's School of Business (ranked in the teens in the USNWR higher ed roundup) actually only carries a quarter of that load - so we somehow need to get 4x as many qualified students into Business majors. And here's where I apologize for slow-playing my hand: Business majors make up a little over 25% of the total labor pool, not the total labor pool that requires degrees. Once we remove the nonprofessional assistants, woodworkers, and terrazzo finishers (an actual category on the website), the percentage more than doubles. Essentially, every college would become a business college, that also just happened to teach other things.\n\n2) Too Few Students, Part 2: Now go to the other end of the employment curve. Even if we punt the (admittedly really tough to defend) Medieval Lit majors, we still need interpreters but we don't need very many of them (only .37 of every 1,000 American jobs), but we DO need a wide variety of them. So now we would have dozens of classes with only one or two students in them, and we could only do that at huge schools like UW, which would deliver 3.7 students into the workforce each year. Small schools like Seattle Pacific University (only a little over 2,000 students) simply wouldn't be able to turn out the students to justify ever teaching a foreign language - proportionally, they would deliver one student every two years. Lonely bugger. \n\n3) Teachers: Getting back to Business, most students take 3-4 courses per term, averaging at least 2 in their major, in an average class size of 30 (which is high, but accounts for large lecture intro courses), and you've got 770 sections at the minimum, per term. Average load for an instructor is 3-4 per term, so we'll go high and say 4. The School of Business would have to carry 193 instructors solely dedicated to Business to cover those students (not counting the general ed classes like Math, not counting at the much more realistic and higher rate of total degree-requiring jobs, and not counting ANY of the higher degree programs like the MBA). It currently has 155 (remember: this includes all of their instructors for undergrads AND grads). So we need at least 38 more professors (and that doesn't count the other courses non-Business courses that those students would need to take if they weren't folded into their major).\n\n4) Teachers, Part 2: Welcome to the UW Foreign Language Department, where they would be graduating almost four students a year. Assuming every one of them was in the same language (or one instructor could teach all of the various languages that they might be interested in), we could hire one teacher to cover all sections. Good news: The student-to-teacher ratio is excellent. Bad news: The tuition-to-credit-hour ratio is abysmal.\n\n5) Placement isn't proof of college success. Finally, the \"you can drag a horse to water, but you can't make him drink\" argument: Sometimes students will apply themselves and succeed for four years and then go do something completely unforeseeable. Michael Crichton went all the way through medical school, got his degree, and then never practiced, choosing to go into writing, producing, and directing full-time. So we got Jurassic Park and the TV series ER, but not an actual practicing doctor. I had a student a couple of years ago who graduated at 19, aced all of her courses in a double-major including Business, and then decided she just really wanted to be a flight attendant. Kids take years off, some put off careers in place of family, and a lucky few don't even need to work for money. And placement isn't even a very good metric for successful college experience. I've had several students who barely scraped through their degrees and got hired almost immediately... by a family member. I've also had students get through my program but get placed in positions totally unrelated to the major - how should we rate that? More importantly, how could the college possibly develop the infrastructure to find sometimes nonsensically random job placements? Here's a quick list of my personal favorite motley crew of undergraduate degrees and their immediate placement: 1) forestry --&gt; public defender, 2) theology --&gt; systems designer, 3) communication --&gt; radiologist, 4) sociology --&gt; graphic designer, 5) graphic design --&gt; clinical psychology, 6) criminology --&gt; Phys. Ed. teacher, and here's the one you'll love: 7) Renaissance Lit and Speech Communication double-major --&gt; medical tech and sales (he got double my salary in his first year in the job)."}, {"id": "2r4fa8", "body": "We spend an absolutely ludicrous amount of public money on education, yet the government rarely demands a return on this investment.

When I started at my university I was often told that finding a job would be easy and I would not have to worry with my diploma. I'm that guy who usually is at the bottom of his class and I start to realize that finding a job might turn out to be a bit harder then expected.\n\nHowever, I don't believe I have wasted 5 years of my life plus a lot of money. When I went to university I thought it would prepare me for my career. But I start to see that this is not the full picture.\n\nAfter studying something for 5 years I noticed I became good at. And after some time I learned that average Joe holds totally wrong beliefs. Even about things that seem evident and crucial to every day life to me. Even about things that seem evident and help you in every day life. This experience results sometimes in the creation of an arrogant prick. But it made me thinking.\n\nProbably those dumb remarks are not that dumb. I have probably said (and still say) much dumber things, But usually I have the luck that I am not talking to an expert on the topic. University has shown me that I shouldn't judge to quick and that their is a vast pool of knowledge I know shit about.\n\nIn university I learned to be critical. When I look at the news and someone shows me numbers I automatically start asking myself what they mean and usually I get angry cause that bitch on the screen is interpreting them wrong.\n\nIt has learned me to know what to accept as an answer. In my own domain I know when to call bullshit. And I tend to believe that during the last years my bullshit radar has improved drastically even for things I'm unfamiliar with. (However, I'm not sure that this is because of university of just becoming more like an adult) \n\nEven when my courses where mostly technical and very mathematically inclined. I learned how to live in a world where not everything is black and white. But a wide spectrum of shades of grey exist. \n\n**TL:DR;** University is not (only) about building a workforce.
