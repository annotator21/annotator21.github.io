His heliocentric ideas were entirely against the church, yet I don't think anybody today really denies this.\n\n&gt;  Admitting unjust imprisonments and torture of prisoners basically telegraphs to the NK people that the regime is not at all infallible\n\nThere is another simpler solution that would not necessarily damage it. They could say that they have been forgiven. If the people of NK are told \"these prisoners have spent their time in prison and have understood my power. Their crimes are remembered but for now they are forgiven. If they do defy me again they will be imprisoned again.\"\n\nI use this information to discuss item 2 of what might convince you. Changes are easily possible without too much damage. You might be right, but those who do believe KJU to be infallible will simply accept that as another infallible move. Those who do not might see it as a warning.\n\n-------\n\n&gt; I also have a hunch that Kim Jong-Un is just a figurehead, but this is pretty much completely unsubstantiated. It just seems to me like the regime itself may have more power than the actual leader of that regime, but I can't back this up at all.\n\nThe main issue I see here is that, as you say, it is merely an unsubstantiated hunch. I could, for example, say that I have a hunch that \"when a US president is elected, (s)he is shown video proof that some conspiracy theory is true and that (s)he is a slave to a group of 11 like-minded people who actually run this country.\"\nAnd then I say that my view would be changed by absolute proof that the president is not just a figurehead.\n\n&gt; Kim Jong-Un has complete control over every action of NK (and is absolutely not just a figurehead).\n\nAs with above, you might be right. But this is a piece of impossible proof. I would have to be elected president to know if there really are those 11 like-minded people (I don't qualify to run for presidency, I was not born in the US nor was I born to US citizens). Just like that, one would have to be at that true ruling regime to know that there is such a ruling regime."}, {"id": "cn0afih", "body": "Sorry, but you do not have a strong understanding of the Church or its infallibility doctrine.

If you are contagious, then you run the risk of infecting your coworkers or clients.  In some jobs, this is a big enough risk that continuing to work with certain illnesses is actually illegal (think doctor or [cook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_Mary)).\n\n2. Being sick, even a bout of depression (whether due to an acute cause like a death in the family or a flare up of a chronic depression problem) can decrease your productivity.  In these cases, your employer is better off if you call in sick and then he can get someone else to do your job for you.  If all you do is come in and get int he way, then you are of no use.  If you can spend a day or two at home and fix your problem to return at full productivity, then your employer comes out ahead in the long run.\n\n3. Very few jobs are worth your life.  Yes there are a few where lives depend on you, and a few where the contagiousness isn't an issue, but for most jobs, the service you are providing isn't worth the risk of forcign yourself to work through your illness and ultimately get worse.  In most cases, you can take a few days off to recover and then continue to work just fine, but if you force yourself to work through it, you will deteriorate, and get to the point where a full recovery is impossible or takes a very long time, during which you are not at your full productivity (as pointed out in point 2) and your own quality of life is suffering.  Like I said before, there is some jobs where coming in a doing a little is more helpful than doing nothing, and there are some jobs where it is worth risking your own personal health to provide the service, but those jobs are very few, and for the most part, they do not apply.\n\nOverall, I think that there are times when you should just suck it up and go to work despite being sick, but every job and person has a cutoff point where it isn't worth it to go to work anymore, and you would know better than just about anyone else where that point is for you and your job."}, {"id": "2pu4b5", "body": "It seems like most workplaces and bosses in the US that I've experienced penalize you for not coming into work for legitimate reasons.

You need to purchase an entirely new lower receiver, hence creating a second firearm.  The 7.62x51mm cartridge is too long to be fed through lowers designed for .223 rem.  Thats why .300 blk is becoming a popular cartridge for many AR owners.   It uses the same magazines and lower receiver that you already own.   However,  even that doesn't hit hard enough for big game hunting. \n\nAll poorly maintained weapons will fall.   However,  the fact that an AR15 is designed with such tight tolerances makes it more susceptible to failures than other rifles.   An AK47 for example,  has a more reliable gas blowback system that does not shit where it eats (I.e. dumps the carbon away from the BCG).  An AK47 is less likely to have catastrophic failures like a double feed,  due to the 7.62x39mm round being wider than the 5.56 NATO.  Saying everything can fail is a poor justification for why this particular rifle malfunctions so much more than other rifles,  especially when competing for the title of \"best rifle on the market today\". \n\nAlso,  forgot to throw this in before but cost.   I have two colleagues who don't hunt or shoot regularly.   They both purchased rifles for home defense only (they live in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors).  But bought WASR10s, one for $100, the other for $175 with spare mags.  ARs can't beat that price point. "}, {"id": "2pu16e", "body": "*Before we start, this is meant to be light hearted, lets not get too spun up.*\n\nMy assertion is that the AR-15 is the single best rifle on the market today (for most people, obviously there will be some exceptions):\n\n1. It is [very easy to clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdBiZfv1jSs)\n\n2. The ability to [swap barrels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NjNEQr4lCM) makes it both more economical and reduces the total number of guns someone would \"need\" to own\n\n3. Its quite accurate, and more then adequate for **most** peoples needs.\n\n3. It is very versatile, and can be easily customized to fit a particular persons needs/preferences\n\n&gt;Before the AR-15 rifle made its way onto the market gun owners needed to buy a different gun for each caliber and application.\n\n&gt;Whether they wanted inexpensive target shooting (with cheap ammo like .22lr) or deer hunting (with a more substantial caliber like .308 Winchester), owners had to buy a different firearm for each use. Changing calibers was expensive, time consuming, and generally a one-way process.\n\n&gt;Shooters were also stuck with their rifle\u2019s ergonomics. If the stock was too long or too short there wasn\u2019t much they could do\u2014except pay a gunsmith to modify the gun. The same was true if you didn\u2019t like the rifle\u2019s trigger or the sights. Changing anything was a major pain in the butt. \n\n[Source](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2012/12/foghorn/the-truth-about-the-ar-15-rifle/)\n\nCMV!\n\n*Spelling\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Some staff had a knack for working with her, and I was one of them. She got upset one day because she lost a puzzle piece (she loved puzzles and was very OCD). We had her mostly contained until she smashed the entertainment center, then my co-worker called the cops. Because they had dealt with her before, 6 of them showed up and piled on top of her trying to get cuffs on her so she could be taken to a psych unit. I was yelling at them telling them they were making it worse and to let me handle it. She stood up (with all 6 cops still hanging on her) and started trying to go grab their arms to bite them. 5 of the backed off, 1 decided he was going to be the badass who took her down. He tried to take her down and she basically ignored him and started going after me. I can take a punch, I've been hit quite a few times, and I'd rather be hit than have her hurt by a cop for a reason she doesn't understand. The cop then gets the brilliant idea that he's going to tell her he has a gun. That got her attention. She finally stood still and faced the cop, who starts telling her that she needs to calm down and all kinds of other stuff, while I'm telling him to stop talking and let me deal with it. He ignores me because he thinks that because she's standing quietly and looking at him he's scared her into submission. I know better, I know she's trying to figure out how to kill this guy. Finally I lose it and I scream \"If you don't shut the fuck up and go away, you're going to get hurt, I don't care if you have a gun or not!\". He finally shut up and told me to go away, he had the situation under control. I told him he didn't know shit, she was figuring out how to get to him and get her hands on him. I got between them and told her we should check the vacuum to see if someone picked it up on accident. She went with me, we checked the vacuum and thankfully it was there. She immediately calmed down and went back to her room to finish her puzzle. The cop was pissed at me for yelling and cussing at him, but his partners told him he should have listened to me in the first place. They left, the day went on, and I smoked a lot of cigarettes.

Working hostels I've worked with lots of people with physical illnesses, mental illnesses, addictions etc. \n\nHonestly, I love it. People ask how you can put up with working with people who don't thank you, or who you work with for years but they still go out and make the same bad decisions etc. My experience? You do get thanked, you have the most amazing relationships with people. You get to see people improve, even if it's only a tiny bit, if you know them well you can see how big a step that is for them. Sure, I've been hit, spat on, held hostage, seen people die, picked up hundreds of needles, cleaned up shit thousands of times, cleaned rooms you wouldn't believe a human could live in etc. For me, doesn't matter.

But the attitude that the vulnerable people you're meant to be helping are selfish is a bad one to have. And in a job where you get very little pay, very long stressful shifts, little to no support from management, high expectations and the pressure piled on by managers who have no idea what you go through etc if you don't care about the people you work for, it's going to get too much. \n\nI'm not trying to pretend it's easy, it's not. I've had months off with stress spent in bed because of a terrible company and the pressure getting too much. My manager's answer to me saying I was finding it hard was to say \"what I find when I'm having a hard time, is that if I bury myself in my work it really helps\". He then went off for six months effectively leaving me in charge of a large hostel with very difficult residents. The local police would say they couldn't cope working there when they had to come out for incidents. \n\nSo yeah, I think it's massively respectable and admirable because you're helping people who need it and that's amazing.

I'm a support worker and it's my favorite job I've had so far. \n\nFirst off, they do care for you. Developmentally disabled people are still people. Sure, some more than others, but just as an example Lori cried when I had to leave my old house to work at my new one because she knew she wouldn't see me as often.  They absolutely care. And even if they didn't, I don't do this for appreciation. I do this for a pay check, but also because it makes me feel better about how I earned it. \n\nI've worked countless retail jobs and I can't stand it. These ungrateful customers looking at me like they're better than me and I fucking hate it. I hate the customer being always right even if they're being and spoiled child. I hate spending 8 hours a day trying to sell someone pants or taking lunch meat orders; it feels so dead eyed and empty and pointless... but here I am helping people LIVE. They need me. Leons teeth would rot out if I didn't tell him to brush everyday; no one would drive wyatt to the doctor if I wasn't here; if I wasn't here to help maintain his diet Steven would go into diabetic shock twice a day. Anyway you wanna slice it, I make it possible for people to live normal lives (or atleast, relatively close to normal). I feel great about what I do. it may not satisfy you, but I love knowing that what i do makes a difference.\n\n\nIn fact, the ONLY PART I hate about this job is people's attitudes that work here. They're lazy and seem to forget that the people we take care of are disabled. They treat them like they should know better, but if they had the mental capability to know better I wouldn't have a job, and more often then not its those same people that end up treating my residents like shit and that pissed me off because they don't deserve that. Honestly if you hold this much disdain for them you shouldn't be doing this job. If you can work a customer based job and feel good about it at the end of the day then by all means go do that, but I really get a great sense of pride from knowing what I do makes someone's else's life better. I have all the patience in the world for someone who NEEDS my help. You should find a new profession.\n\nEdit: sorry for typos. Coincidentally I wrote this while at work on my phone lol.

And this is one of my better patients.\n\nI'm a young, recent university graduate. In the time between finishing my degree and deciding what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, I stumbled into mental health. As I was planning on going forward into either a postgraduate course or career related to healthcare, it seemed like this was just the kind of experience that would help me progress.\n\nInstead, I'm burnt out. Seriously fucking burnt out. Believe me, I'm not squeamish about the dirty aspects of the job. Hell, I don't even mind working nights. What I mind is that I'm spending my days being assaulted and mistreated (not even just by the patients!), and my nights alone so I can get enough sleep, for the sake of a job that other potential employers have seen on my CV and sneered at as being \"easy\" or \"lazy\". \n\nThis isn't just a thankless job.

You are essentially an indentured servant to the most selfish people on the planet.\n\nYou are kicked, punched, bitten, spat on, handle piss and shit, constantly annoyed, have your hair pulled, toes stamped on, clothes ripped, shirts ruined and have your ego wrecked. The hours are ridiculously long (hello 21 hour shifts, I sincerely wish I was kidding). It is an absolutely horrible, exhausting, thankless job that commands about as much respect from the general public as unemployment.\n\nIn case you can't tell I'm a support worker and I hate every waking second that reminds me of this job.

Most of the comments I've seen here that are anti-child are the result of other people making really bad parenting decisions.  Like a parent bringing a very small child to a movie that's rated PG13 or R and likely to be scary or too loud for that child to handle.  Or a child who is clearly going far beyond what most people would allow (like letting ten year old dig up a garden planted by someone else).  \n\nThese things are poor parenting, and when that happens it tends to annoy everyone else.  No one really wants their movie date night ruined because some mother thought it was a good idea to take a 9 month old into Guardians of the Galaxy.  The movie is loud and probably scary for a baby, and a baby doesn't know how to act in a theater.  And not teaching kids to not touch things that don't belong to them is likewise really bad parenting.  You're supposed to watch your child, teach them right from wrong.  Sometimes that means you don't get to do what you want, and sometimes it means that you're going to have to be the badguy.  \n\nOn the issue of the circle jerks, I think they are less of an issue.  I don't see a large movement of anti-child sentiment, and I really don't expect to.  It's just one opinion out of dozens, from the Duggards to the Child Free.

And I believe is not just reddit.   There is a % of society who is childfree.\n\nForget for a second how kids feel about themselves.   The question is how adults feel about them.

This is the American culture and perhaps also the mindset in some other western countries. \n\nYou haven't given a good argument on on why we must tolerate poorly behaved kids (the ankle biters).  The well behaved kids rarely go noticed because they know how to act civilized in the restaurant.   They're not the ones climbing over the booth and throwing food across the aisle.\n\n\n\n&gt;  And two, it has become cool to be a loner, to be against increasing the surplus population, to be anti-breeder. \n\nOne doesn't need to be a loner to be against population growth.

Encouraging these comments and indulging in the circle-jerk perpetuates this attitude and creates a culture of child-haters. As seen by any other popular opinion on reddit. It breeds a certain \"hive mind\" type response.\n\nThe best way to break the cycle of child hating is to address the complaints people have about the kids.    Some kids are totally out of control.   And it doesn't help when some parents almost worship their kids, and heaven forbid anyone suggest their child is acting inappropriately.   Or what of the people who have kids so they won't feel lonely and they treat the child as a friend.    Bottom line is that too many parents let their kids act like ankle biters.

And since most parents would rather rip your face off than admit to themselves they're not as good a parent as they could be I keep my distance, and my face. But I feel for the those kids, they deserve better from their parents. \n\nAnd speaking of parents, they're the reason anybody hates kids. By being unwilling/unable to leave them out of social situations they have no business being apart of. The \"hate\" that gets thrown around is really just frustration at whomever's decided to do just that. "}, {"id": "2pt2b2", "body": "You hear it in every corner of Reddit when children are mentioned or when a picture of a baby is posted. \"Human babies are ugly/gross/annoying.\" People on Reddit tend to pride themselves on how much they prefer other infant animals over human children. it has become \"cool\" to dislike human children.\n\nChildren (under 10) are, for the most part: innocent, helpless, and curious. These traits should inspire adult humans to want to guide them, help them, and influence their generation to be a better than ours. Instead many people seem to want to shun them. This has scary implications for our future. If we treat our youth as an annoyance, as not worthy of attention, we will overcorrect what happened to our generation (every kid being coddled and told they are a special butterfly, producing a generation of self-absorbed brats). I get that helicopter parenting has produced bad results in many but shunning children, disliking them, or even hating them is an extreme that will not correct the problem, but rather create an entirely new one. \n\n1. I think this attitude mostly comes from two places: One, many redditors are products of helicopter parenting and feel that the world should be about them and they shouldn't have to tolerate \"annoying little ankle-biters.\" And two, it has become cool to be a loner, to be against increasing the surplus population, to be anti-breeder. \n2. I think, regardless of its origins, this popular negative opinion of children is unhealthy and will damage this generation's youth and thus our future if left unchecked. A child growing up thinking he is less important than everyone else could be just as, if not more, damaging than a child growing up thinking he is more important than everyone else.\n3. Encouraging these comments and indulging in the circle-jerk perpetuates this attitude and creates a culture of child-haters. As seen by any other popular opinion on reddit. It breeds a certain \"hive mind\" type response.\n\n**Please change my view**\n\n**My View has been changed by /u/appropriate-username, /u/Wrestlingisgood, and /u/the_skeleton_queen Thank you!**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It's typically a trait of giving their full attention and focus to completing a task as quickly and effectively as possible, getting the most information/bonding/engagement from a conversation, or paying the most attention they can to an event or surroundings where, while there, it could clearly or even possibly be beneficial to observe and understand as much as they can about what is going on.\n\n\n* Mouth:  While not always as indicative as the eyes, a mouth that is almost always gaping open (not just slightly) while not eating or talking, especially in a manner that they seem unaware or uninterested in, is, in my experience, a sign of stupidity. \nExcluding people who slightly have their mouth open (because their physiology makes it unatuaral to stay completely shut, or they can't nose breathe), how many smart people have you met with dominately gaping open mouths all the time.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The arguments in favour of atheism are not arguments that intend to be moral guides.

But as you see, it's only a small part of a small part of atheists concerned with discussing this.  \n\nNow, supposing there isn't a god and also no afterlife, where do we seek moral guidance?  \n\nMy answer is: our morality is evolved.  The same internal force that makes us want to reproduce, eat, seek beauty, avoid threats and other human (and animal) behaviour is the force that tells us that it has historically been convenient to us to be nice to each other.  The more abundance there is, the less need to be nasty to each other (hence I am convinced societies get more moral as the centuries go by).  When we help others beyond the law, this gives a sense of safety and pleasure.  \nAnimals are nice to each other on many occasions, and they have no moral guidance from someone anticipating an afterlife, it's simply that, as us, they descend from those creatures that were nice to each other, and those that were not at all died out.

I can fail to deliver but keep your money, or you can refuse to pay after I have already gotten the product to sell you.

The first is when your biological processes cease functioning, and the second is when the last person speaks your name for the very last time. While I like this thought, it seems a bit shortsighted. I am not my name, I am my influence.\n\nMy morality is based on the idea that I *will* continue when I'm gone, at least for a while, through how I influence that which surrounds me. Every interaction you have with others changes their reality, and that change is permanent, even if subtle (You reading this is permanently changing your reality from a state of \"not having read this\" to a state of \"having read this\"). \n\nThe kindness and compassion I show towards others can have a lasting, and possibly life altering effect on the rest of their lives. They can pass these moments, and my \"influence\" on to their children, and they to their children, and so on. Even when my name gets separated from the influence, I'm still living on.\n\nAfter my \"first death\", my atoms and molecules and energies will dissolve into the soil, and then maybe turn into a tree, or a rock, or water, or anything at all. Maybe one day, the great great grandchild of my best friend will be having a rough day, and pause to rest underneath the tree that contains a small portion of particles that used to be called NotNowImOnReddit, and they'll reflect on how kind, generous, and moral their family is. They'll smile as they think about how lucky they are to have such a loving, compassionate family. They'll have no idea that the tree that is giving them shade also helped to inspire this love.\n\nIn essence, I suppose we don't ever really die. Because what are *you* if not the way you manipulate and influence the universe to change in particular ways? Every action you take, every breath you breathe, every beat of your heart, sets off a chain reaction across space and time. Those chain reactions can span miles and generations, whether you're around to see it or not. Other than that, we're just particles of the universe, constantly shifting and changing, that just so happened to come together to form a person for a short period of time.\n\nChange is the only constant. I can influence that change in either a positive (moral) way, or in a negative way. I choose positive. My morality comes from the lessons I've learned, which come from people who learned it from someone else, who learned it from someone else, who learned it from someone else, who may just be a part of the tree I see outside my window right now while I'm thinking about all of this. \n\nAs for acting morally because of some great reward after you die? Well, some folks believe that suicide bombing will get you a reward in the afterlife, but I imagine that's not what you're talking about. Some folks believe that God has built a kingdom where we will all reside if we do good while we are alive. But:\n\n&gt;\"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\" (Luke 17:21)\n\nThat sounds like God's kingdom is more of an internal enlightenment than a posthumous playground for the spiritually sound. \n\nAnyway, this got a bit multidirectional and ranty, so I'll just end it by saying that morality's long term rewards are something you might not ever see. In a culture of instant gratification, we may not put too much faith into that, but well... we should.\n\ntl;dr we're living amongst the afterlife.

One of the reasons I like it, however, is because of how serious it does NOT take itself. When people talk about rappers being deep, I laugh most of the time. Especially if they cite Tupac. There are plenty of examples given from rappers who are very conscious and clever, but even those hardly ever say anything I feel holds a candle to good lyrics from other genres. Comparing it to actual poetry I feel is a very immature argument, and usually made by people who never read actual poetry. Also, as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped, rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument. Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public, but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease, and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy. \n\nCase in point, Eazy E became a famous rapper (even touring the white house) doing something he was terrible at. And rightfully so, because you can be a terrible rapper and still sell a ton of records and actually be considered great at what you do, and that does not apply to other forms of music. \n\n***EDIT*** Thanks a ton for your replies, an downvotes. I will go to bed now, but I wanted to say thanks for sure for your thoughtful responses. In summary, I read Float by Aesop Rock a while ago (a song I have loved for years) and do feel it is as impressive as someone playing a musical instrument extremely well. I will say he's the exception, in a field where talent rarely gets the recognition it deserves. Gnight!\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There are guys who are great at seamlessly riding the rhythm of the beat, I would link it if I wasn't on mobile but Suddenly by A$AP Rocky is a great example of this (especially when the beat picks up midway through). The other kind of guys rap over beats with very odd rhythms, yet still are able to compliment it with their own.
