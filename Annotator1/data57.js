Comparing it to actual poetry I feel is a very immature argument, and usually made by people who never read actual poetry. Also, as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped, rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument.

Converge is an excellent example of this. \n\nThe vocalist in many metal bands provides, in my opinion, either a very bare-bones melody (by changing pitch and intensity), or a second percussionist, layering a new rhythm over whatever the other musicians are doing, that can diverge wildly from what the others are doing. Meshuggah is another good example, stacking layer upon layer of polyrhythms.

Every single syllable of what is very often a verbose construction has to be in time (or intentionally and tastefully out of time). A good rapper needs to project their vocals well, vary their delivery, and very often hit the right notes.\n\nNot only that, but there is a strong emphasis in hip hop on writing your own material.  That means you not only have to be able to deliver it, but write intricate rhymes and word play in a way that is rhythmically interesting.\n\nI think people tend to think of it the wrong way.  They treat *singing* like playing an instrument and *rapping* like it's just talking to the beat.  The reality is that rapping is more comparable to playing a rhythm instrument with your vocals.  Next time you listen to a rap song, imagine a drummer playing a solo over a steady rhythm track.\n\nSo, the argument you are making is that drums are easier to play than a harmonica, for instance (I say harmonica because it is a more intuitive instrument like vocals are).\n\nFirst of all, a comparison like this is nonsensical.  Difficult in what way?  To be a beginner?  To play a particular genre?  To master the instrument?  Sure, getting started playing piano may be easier to play then a trumpet, but being a master at either instrument takes years of practice.  Calling one more difficult than the other is a vast oversimplification of the issue.\n\nAlso, consider this:  if you want to get good at singing, at playing piano or guitar or xylophone, you can take lessons, go to school for it, etc.  If you want to get good at rapping, you have to independently study and analyze hip hop music and practice it on your own.  There is no hip hop textbook, just people making up the genre as they go.  That alone makes it extremely difficult.  That's also why old school hip hop was so simple.  When you take a look at golden age hip hop, you start to see more intricacy, as people explored the potential of the art form.\n\nAnother thing that I think is often overlooked is that even when rap vocals are properly treated like a rhythm instrument, the words are treated as separate from the composition.  Granted, this is the case with *all* music, but the reality is that rappers are using words *as* an instrument, so the content and even the meaning of the words can't be separated from the composition.  You can separate the two with singing and just focus on the notes, rhythm, and timbre, etc.  but rap is all about the words, to separate them from the composition is to miss the entire point of rap.\n\nSo, my point is that creating meaningful, rhyming, rhythmic, musical compositions with words isn't easy, nor is it easy to powerfully deliver those words with precision and appropriate emphasis.\n"}, {"id": "cmzhxux", "body": "Rapping badly is no easier than playing an instrument badly. Just as being a good rapper can take as much talent and hard work as playing an instrument well. It totally depends on the person, as one or the other could come easier to them personally.\n\nRapping doesn't require any tools (instruments), so anyone can pick it up and have a go with minimal effort. So there will inevitably be a lot of bad rappers. Some of these bad rappers become famous. I believe this is mainly due to the instrumentals (music) on the songs that make them famous. Meaning that the rapping isn't a very important factor in whether a song is popular or not. Of course a song with a good beat AND good rapping would be optimal, but good beats can be enough to carry a rapper to fame. This does not mean that rapping is easier than playing an instrument, it just means that as long as the rapper isn't absolutely terrible, it does not matter as much as the music.\n\nThis can also be true for other genres. There are plenty of non rap songs have terrible lyrics with good music and are loved by many. Does this mean that singing is easier than rapping or playing instruments?\n\nAlso I disagree with your point that rap lyrics can never compare to other lyrics genres. What is it that you think makes singing words with melody rather than rapping words makes them any more or less significant or clever? In fact I would say the opposite in most cases, as rapping allows for more room to articulate ideas, as on average rap songs have more words than other genres.\n\nIf you have not already, I suggest you listen to Kendrick Lamar's album, *Good Kid, M.A.A.D City*, as an example of great lyricism and cohesion as a project. I have never listened to another album (rap or not) with lyrics that have impacted me as much as this. I believe that with infinite practice, no one else on earth could recreate what Kendrick Lamar did with this album.

Just as being a good rapper can take as much talent and hard work as playing an instrument well. It totally depends on the person, as one or the other could come easier to them personally.\n\nRapping doesn't require any tools (instruments), so anyone can pick it up and have a go with minimal effort. So there will inevitably be a lot of bad rappers. Some of these bad rappers become famous. I believe this is mainly due to the instrumentals (music) on the songs that make them famous. Meaning that the rapping isn't a very important factor in whether a song is popular or not. Of course a song with a good beat AND good rapping would be optimal, but good beats can be enough to carry a rapper to fame. This does not mean that rapping is easier than playing an instrument, it just means that as long as the rapper isn't absolutely terrible, it does not matter as much as the music.\n\nThis can also be true for other genres. There are plenty of non rap songs have terrible lyrics with good music and are loved by many. Does this mean that singing is easier than rapping or playing instruments?\n\nAlso I disagree with your point that rap lyrics can never compare to other lyrics genres. What is it that you think makes singing words with melody rather than rapping words makes them any more or less significant or clever? In fact I would say the opposite in most cases, as rapping allows for more room to articulate ideas, as on average rap songs have more words than other genres.\n\nIf you have not already, I suggest you listen to Kendrick Lamar's album, *Good Kid, M.A.A.D City*, as an example of great lyricism and cohesion as a project. I have never listened to another album (rap or not) with lyrics that have impacted me as much as this.

Just as being a good rapper can take as much talent and hard work as playing an instrument well. It totally depends on the person, as one or the other could come easier to them personally.\n\nRapping doesn't require any tools (instruments), so anyone can pick it up and have a go with minimal effort. So there will inevitably be a lot of bad rappers. Some of these bad rappers become famous. I believe this is mainly due to the instrumentals (music) on the songs that make them famous. Meaning that the rapping isn't a very important factor in whether a song is popular or not. Of course a song with a good beat AND good rapping would be optimal, but good beats can be enough to carry a rapper to fame. This does not mean that rapping is easier than playing an instrument, it just means that as long as the rapper isn't absolutely terrible, it does not matter as much as the music.\n\nThis can also be true for other genres. There are plenty of non rap songs have terrible lyrics with good music and are loved by many. Does this mean that singing is easier than rapping or playing instruments?\n\nAlso I disagree with your point that rap lyrics can never compare to other lyrics genres. What is it that you think makes singing words with melody rather than rapping words makes them any more or less significant or clever? In fact I would say the opposite in most cases, as rapping allows for more room to articulate ideas, as on average rap songs have more words than other genres.\n\nIf you have not already, I suggest you listen to Kendrick Lamar's album, *Good Kid, M.A.A.D City*, as an example of great lyricism and cohesion as a project.

Are songs about love, loss, or any other common human experience really all that deep, just because they're wrapped in metaphor? We're not talking about fucking philosophy here!

Of course not! He wrote with a depth that captured the human experience without literary embellishments. \n\nSo, with that in mind, I propose a challenge: Why don't you find me one rock song, or indie song, or blues song, whatever, that captures the experiences of a black man growing up in a contemporary inner city environment better than Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid Maad City. If you can't find one, maybe you could make it the fuck up, it's so easy right?

Case in point: Green Day (4 powerchords in 4/4 time). Obviously bullshit when you consider the level of mastery fellas such as Joe Satriani, Tosin Abasi, Jimi Jendrix, Paul Gilbert, etc. have/had over their instrument.\n\nSeriously any argument that says \"I think 'x' form of artistic expression is easier/less challenging than 'y' form of artistic expression\" is flawed to begin with. Anyone can play mediocre bass. But there's always going to be a chosen few who elevate bass to a higher level. There's someone out there who's taken the xylophone to extreme levels of virtuosity.

Getting rhythm, flow, meter, presence, projection, etc. right requires just as much vocal technique and practice as being a singer. You can't just get in front of a mic, spit some lyrics, and expect it to SOUND good. It's going to sound mediocre. Likely your rhythm and flow will be very loose. You won't be rapping from the gut so you won't have much projection or presence. If you're unpracticed you probably won't enunciate well.

You simply cannot compare the two disciplines.  What may be extremely easy for one musician can be incredibly difficult for another.  Mostly I want to point out a flaw in this particular line:\n\n\"Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public, but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease, and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy.\" \n\nThis is basically the bulk of your argument, but it is entirely untrue.  Regarding \"Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public\":\n\nSome people are natural singers born with an impressive vocal range and perfect pitch.  For them, they only need to practice their technique, but its relatively easy for them to sing in public easily...

When people say rappers are deep: perhaps what they're saying is that rap evokes emotion in them.  Many artists eschew multi-layered lyrics to better portray a single point.  Painting a canvas with words to absorb the listener, to me, is better than making a record where people have to stop after each track and think about what they just heard *might* mean.  Saving Private Ryan isn't exactly subtle, but it's still a great movie which evokes an emotional response.\n\n2. Rapping as poetry is a completely reasonable comparison.  There are a *lot* of poets out there, and no one style reflects \"real\" poetry.  At one point in history, the Psalms stood alone atop poetry's greatest achievements.  Is \"actual\" poetry Homer Epics, or King David's Psalms, or Walt Whitman, or Shel Silverstein?  Or Bob Dylan?  All of them?  And if so, why can't hip hop lyrics be included?\n\n3. It's probably a little easier to rap poorly than it is to play an instrument poorly.  But that doesn't mean it's easier to rap well than it is to play an instrument or sing well.  Shit, the guy who won Best Rap Album last year at the Grammy's can barely stay on time, and he does it for a living!  Breaking down rap into simply \"reciting lyrics over a beat\" is the same logic used to deride pop songs.  Hell, all of Punk Rock was built around not playing your instruments in the traditionally accepted way.\n\n4. Eazy E became famous because NWA was a revolutionary group which brought a lot of never before heard lyrical content to the forefront of American pop music.  Gangsta Rap influenced 25 years (and counting) of rap and pop music that came after it.\n\n&gt;And rightfully so, because you can be a terrible rapper and still sell a ton of records and actually be considered great at what you do, and that does not apply to other forms of music.\n\nNo one seriously considered Eazy E a great rapper from a musical standpoint.  Plus, you're crazy if you think every rock ringer is Freddy Mercury or Robert Plant.  Plenty of them are [Bille Joe Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFcNltZJ7j4) or [Joey Ramone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-HuzqCnok8)."}, {"id": "2ps2mr", "body": "Allow me to preface by saying I love rap music.

Math is a pretty popular example of this. For some people, advanced math concepts just click within their minds seconds after being introduced to them and they don't need to do very much to understand them. (Source: any Caltech student ever.) For others, they could study the same material for days and be hopelessly lost.\n\nMusic is no exception. Some people just really have a way with words and can write really powerful songs or prose without trying. Others could study the artform and spend 10,000 hours attempting to master the art of songwriting only to write the same kind of material.\n\n(Hell, I wish I could write posts half as well as some people on reddit.)\n\nAt its core, hip-hop, in my opinion, is all about wordplay and delivery. Like prose, the impact of some hip-hop songs can change completely by altering the flow and delivery of a song. As well, the removal of even *single* words (in some cases) can change the meaning of an entire bar or even the entire song. If you spend some time listening to artists that are often cited on /r/hiphopheads, you'll see that the level of depth that some hip-hop artists strive to reach is pretty impressive. I had to listen to some tracks on *Overcast* by Atmosphere a few times before I  understood their messages; there was a lot going on the details, and in a good way. \n\nHip-hop isn't even *just* about the song-writing. \"Sick/phat beats\" have ALWAYS been a very important element of hip-hop culture. In fact, the DJ was much more important than the MC way back in the day. People came for the beats and stayed for the rhymes, and it's still sort-of like this. \n\nHaving said all of this, the beauty and curse of music that anyone can do it. Anyone can put some words on paper and record them as a song. Anyone can throw up Logic or whatever and mash sounds together. If you have a browse through Soundcloud on any day in the week, you will probably find hundreds or thousands of beat samples and MCs rhyming to some samples. Many, like you, probably thought \"this hip-hop shit is easy! how is drake making millions off of this shit? i've gotta cop some of that paper.\"\n\nMany have yet to usurp Drake's ridiculous cash flow. \n\nUnsurprisingly, so many have written about how hard \"the rap game\" is.\n\nTL;DR: Listen to some tracks on Soundcloud and Bandcamp.

But flat out easier? Highly debatable.\n\nPersonally I find singing a lot easier than rapping.  Singing is slower, harmonic, and doesn't - broadly - change pace very often.\n\nRapping can speed up and slow down, it has a cadence that can be incredibly difficult to mimic effectively.  I can karaoke sing a whole bunch of different styles of singing relatively easily, crossing genres and decades.  I can maybe rap a fraction of the available hip hop songs.\n\nJust enunciating clearly can be incredibly difficult, let alone trying to keep pace with the beat, and pauses.  It can be a very irregular art form.\n\nRap as an art and talent is different than singing and playing instrument, with difficulties unique to itself.  Some aspects are easier, and others are harder than the others.\n\nIf it was as easy as you claim, I think we'd see a lot more cross-over artists going from Singing to Hip Hop and back.

Comparing it to actual poetry I feel is a very immature argument, and usually made by people who never read actual poetry. Also, as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped, rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument. Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public, but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease, and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy. \n\nCase in point, Eazy E became a famous rapper (even touring the white house) doing something he was terrible at. And rightfully so, because you can be a terrible rapper and still sell a ton of records and actually be considered great at what you do, and that does not apply to other forms of music. \n\n***EDIT*** Thanks a ton for your replies, an downvotes. I will go to bed now, but I wanted to say thanks for sure for your thoughtful responses. In summary, I read Float by Aesop Rock a while ago (a song I have loved for years) and do feel it is as impressive as someone playing a musical instrument extremely well. I will say he's the exception, in a field where talent rarely gets the recognition it deserves. Gnight!\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I was like WTF? \n\nBut,  anyway,  I would say that rapp-ing is easy to do but hard to master,  actually very much like musical performance.  The trick is that since most people already have a basic understanding of how to use their vocal chords,  it seems easier to start with.... But actually it's just that you already have years of practice.  Teaching someone who had never spoken to rap would probably be just as hard if not harder than teaching an instrument.

Two hostages died. \n\nEight hours later, [132 children were murdered](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/17/world/asia/pakistan-peshawar-school-attack/) by Islamic terrorists in Pakistan. \n\nYesterday we learned that 32 people were killed and [185 woman and children were kidnapped](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/18/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-kidnapping/) by Islamic terrorists in Nigeria. News of the attack took four days to emerge because of a lack of communication.\n\nThese were the big attacks of the last couple of days. Other attacks barely got any attention. People were beheaded in Syria by ISIS. Suicide bombers killed a lot of innocents in Yemen. People died because of attacks in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the cause of all this violence? A lot of people blame it on 'extremists' or 'fundamentalists'. Supposedly, Islam is peaceful and most Muslims are tolerant and liberal and it's just that extremists always do this kind of stuff, regardless of the religion. \n\nYet here in Europe we are taught many times about the atrocities in World War Two. We have to learn that ideology can cause common people to do awful things. \n\nWe don't focus on those who operated the gas chambers. It's not like these people were outliers. We are told how racism and bigotry were common. How the entire Nazi culture and ideology were horrible and caused so much suffering. \n\nYet when it comes to religion in general and Islam in specific, we seem to have forgotten all those lessons. \"People kill because they are crazy, not because of Islam\". \"People are homophobic because they are assholes, not because of religion\".\n\n---\n\nReligious scripture was written centuries ago. It's full of statements that are at odds with modern morality. Islamic scripture encourages killing those who leave Islam, it encourages martyrdom, it encourages fighting unbelievers. \n\nA lot of religious commandments are ignored. But this is the result of lots of campaigns that strive to increase tolerance. It was not a deliberate religious choice. Religious people ignore parts of their scripture, but it has 'evolved this way', it's not a logical choice. \n\n&gt;I'm reading the book \"The Year of Living Biblically,\" by A.J. Acobs.  He tried to follow all of the commandments in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) for one year.  He quickly found that\n\n&gt;* a lot of the rules in the Bible are impossible, illegal, or embarassing to follow nowadays; like wearing tassels, tying your money to yourself, stoning adulterers, not eating fruit from a tree less than 5 years old, and not touching anything that a menstruating woman has touched; and\n\n&gt;* this didn't seem to bother more than a handful of the one-third to one-half of Americans who claim the Bible is the word of God.\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;Religious communities actually protect their members from religion in one sense - **they develop an unspoken consensus on which parts of their religion members can legitimately ignore**.  New converts sometimes try to actually do what their religion tells them to do.\n\n&gt;I remember many times growing up when missionaries described the crazy things their new converts in remote areas did on reading the Bible for the first time - they refused to be taught by female missionaries; they insisted on following Old Testament commandments; they decided that everyone in the village had to confess all of their sins against everyone else in the village; they prayed to God and assumed He would do what they asked; they believed the Christian God would cure their diseases.  **We would always laugh a little at the naivete of these new converts; I could barely hear the tiny voice in my head saying but they're just believing that the Bible means what it says...**\n\n&gt;How do we explain the blindness of people to a religion they grew up with?\n\n&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/\n\nIslamic 'extremists' might break the unspoken consensus on which parts of Islam they can ignore, but it's not like they're deviating more from scripture than other Muslims or modern Christians. \n\nThere were a lot of moderate Nazis. People who thought that Hitler would be less extreme if he got into power, like every other politician who doesn't do what he promised. People who joined the Nazi party because of legal, financial and professional benefits instead of ideological conviction. People who hated the Treaty of Versailles but were tolerant of Jews. Yet all of us realize that Nazism is a dangerous and terrible ideology. If I blame WWII and the Holocaust on 'extremists' who are crazy anyway and do terrible things regardless of ideology, I'm seen as some kind of Neo-Nazi. \n\nBut when I say that religion in general and Islamic in specific causes a lot of problems in today's world, I'm seen as a bigot and an Islamophobe. \n\n**TL;DR:** Religion and ideology can cause 'normal' people to do horrible things. They are real influences, and extremism can be countered by changing ideology and religion. Blaming Islamic terrorism on 'extremists' instead of Islam itself is like blaming the atrocities of WWII on extremists while ignoring the dangers of Nazism. **Change my view!**"}, {"id": "cmzmsai", "body": "I think the comparison between national socialism and islam fails because those are hardly comparable in their structure:\n\nNational Socialism was the ideology of a political movement in Germany in the 20s-40s.
