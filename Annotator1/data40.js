I was raised by alcoholic father. I think there's a big hipocrisy around that. Alcohol is not considered as a hard drug although is more dangerous than many drugs considered as hard. It damages physically the brain everytime the person is drinking and conducts to various risky behaviors . It's the cause of many cases of violence or car accidents. I dont think that only the person who was attacker or drunken driver is the only one who is guilty because the alcohol limits the ability to think reasonably. I blame also the 'drinking culture' for that and, of course, the people who are standing behind it.\n\nI dont think thats the problem only with minority who abuse alcohol. I think that there will always be pathological minority and the cases of 'misuse' of alcohol as long as it is commonly used. It's like road transport and car accidents - as long as people drives car the accidents will happen. But existence of road transport is justified because it has far more pros than cons. I bet that just ambulances saves more lives than number of people who dies because of traffic accidents. I'm not including the benefits that comes out of highly developed transport and their impact on standard of life.\n\nBut the alcohol is not necessary to life.\n\n**I think that talking about alcohol like something innocent and approving it's consumption is morally wrong.

I grant you that there is merit to that idea but, lets be frank, if someone is doesn't have their life together to the point where they are out on the streets, how can we expect them to lead anything? This is why politicians have advisors on staff, so that they can get \"expert\" opinions when they are under educated on an issue.  America (and every other country in the world for that matter) has a vast array of problems ranging from social to economic to geopolitical, for this reason its better to have someone who is an effective problem solver. While a homeless person might have some very valuable insight on dealing with life on the streets, that doesn't mean they would have strong ideas on how to actually go about solving that problem, not to mention on how to deal with America's complicated relationship with China (for example).

Chinese were imported as a source of cheap railroad labour in the 1880's. But once the railroad was done, there was little desire for these Chinese men to remain in Canada. So, to prevent their continued migration in search of jobs, the Canadian government placed a head tax on each Chinese person (even children!) coming over from Hong Kong or elsewhere. Eventually, these costs would rise to around $500 per person (enough to buy several houses) until the 1920's when Chinese were simply banned from entrance until the 1950's.

Sure.  However, the rest is just flat-out wrong.  (Please note that I'm taking a *very* topical view in order to avoid half a dozen posts.  If you take issue with anything specific, please do mention it and I'll happily elaborate.  Rather sleep-deprived, so please excuse the occasional mistake.)\n\nRussia has been expanding, contracting, colonizing and recolonizing for most of recorded history.  Its most dramatic expansions happened between about 1500 and 1900 and, mostly slowed while shifting *south* over time.  Though Russia expanded far further east than any other direction, thanks to the Arctic to the north and Europe to the west, it never passed what's now Alaska.  In case you're a bit rusty on the dates (I confess I had to double-check), this strongly conflicts with the idea of American intervention.  The U.S. did not exist as a nation until 1776, making any prior action British rather than American.  Even then, the U.S. was still mostly hostile to Canada (British, remember) and wouldn't have done much to deter Russia.  This persisted until at least 1815 (when the War of 1812 ended), which is important because by 1815 Russia *already* owned most of Alaska.  This was all fairly peaceful as far as the world powers were concerned: while both Britain and Spain (yes, *Spain*) made halfhearted claims to the region, neither had ever colonized it and there was never much fighting over the matter.  (The closest things got were the British and Spanish squabbling over much more southern territory on Vancouver Island.)  The Russians never attempted to expand into established British territory, as seen by the fairly sharp border with the Yukon, though the southern border of Alaska has always been a bit fuzzy.\n\nRussia's presence in the Americas ended in 1867 with the Alaska Purchase.  While tempting to view as a classic example of American intervention, it was really nothing of the sort: Russia couldn't *afford* to keep Alaska (let alone expand further) due to its own financial difficulties, colonization was going poorly and trade was unprofitable, so Russia wanted pretty much nothing to do with it.  They didn't want Britain to have it, perhaps fearing a British expansion into Russia, so they did the next best thing and sold it to the Americans.  If anything, it was *Russia* who wanted an American Alaska as a buffer against the *British*, not the other way around.  (This may actually have been a good move, considering the European land grab from 1870 to 1900, though a British expansion into Russia via Canada was never really likely.)  The Americans themselves wanted it not as a buffer against Russia, but as a first step towards wider expansion in the Americas and because it's the only property anyone would sell them.  This turned out to be both a good and bad decision, since despite Seward's failure to manage any real expansion into Canada or Mexico (let alone Central America or Greenland) it averted some later issues during the Cold War.  This all makes much more sense when you realize that for all its current influence, the U.S. didn't really emerge as a major world power until the *very* end of the 1800s, well after the Alaska Purchase, the end of Russian presence in the Americas, *and* Canada's emergence as a distinct entity (only a few months later) with the BNA Act.  The U.S. did not become even remotely capable of threatening Russia until Russia had left the building, and the main reason it got Alaska was because Russia saw it as far *less* of a threat than the British.\n\nNear the end of the 1800s, Russia was not doing too great.  The freeing of the serfs in 1861 had not fixed revolutionary tensions, yet another war in the 1870s (the Russo-Turkish war) didn't help either, and the ascension of Alexander III in 1881 was followed by a wave of isolationist policy and rollbacks of many of Alexander II's reforms (though he did manage to avoid any major military conflicts, which was actually a pretty significant feat given his predecessors).  At this point, Russia was *not* challenging Britain: their response to Britain's \"dude, what the fuck?\" over the Treaty of San Stefano was basically \"fine, fine, whatever.\"  They weren't in any condition to even risk *annoying* Britain on their own, let alone go trying to take one of their dominions, and most of the 1880s was spend dealing with a variety of uprisings and territorial squabbles.  (Note: there were some further issues with Britain around 1881 related to an occupation of Turkmen lands, but Germany stepped in and calmed things down.)  Nicholas II stepped up in 1894 and pretty much followed along with his father's policies, albeit with far less common sense.  In the end, the guy basically *broke* Russia, though most of that didn't happen until after 1900.\n\nWhile some will argue for a later end to the period of Russian expansion (or colonialism), actual territorial expansion had effectively ceased by 1900.  From 1900 to 1991 (the latest point usually cited), the only significant new acquisition was the Russian Arctic Islands, which were \"acquired\" only in the sense that Russia finally noticed them and bothered to say \"oh, hey guys, these chunks of rock up north are ours BTW.\"  Besides the mess that was WWI and the subsequent civil war (which were basically a net neutral), everything since can pretty much be filed under \"border squabbles.\"  Presuming you meant \"the expansion of Russia\" in the conventional sense rather than \"Russia's general bullshit over the last couple hundred years,\" this would be the end of the timeline.  As noted above, nowhere did the U.S. play an instrumental role in protecting Canada from Russia, mostly because the U.S. wasn't even really a world power until the last couple decades of the period.  Remove the U.S. entirely, and the only real difference would probably have been the British eventually forcing Russia out of Alaska just in time for a very young Canada to say \"thanks, dad, this'll look great in my new apartment.\"\n\nThings didn't improve after 1900.  Nicholas II jumped headlong into the Russo-Japanese war in 1904 without any clue what he was doing (though technically Japan started it, based on disagreements on the custody of Korea), and the mighty Russian Empire promptly got curb-stomped by an fricking archipelago.  Nicholas refused to cut his losses, right up until he realized that if he didn't Russia was *completely* fucked.  He then cut his losses.  Things promptly rolled into the 1905 revolution which, while tame by the standards of Russian revolutions, was still a pretty serious mess and resulted in several years of squabbling over the newly established Duma.  Throughout this period (1906 onward) Russia returned to its previous squabbling with Austria-Hungary over the Balkans (particularly Serbia), and the instability in the region only got worse with the First and Second Balkan Wars around 1912 right up until a certain Serbian terrorist took a shot at an Archduke in 1914 and....well, you know the rest.  WWI caused territory fluctuations, internal unrest (not helped by the Kuluks pretty much breaking the food supply), and absolutely catastrophic military losses.  To use the technical term, Russia got the shit kicked out of it.  The trend showed no signs of abating, and with WWI *still going on* the Russian government basically fell over in early 1917.  It then fell over again in *late* 1917, and (temporarily) released most of its territories.  *Then*, (since the last revolution didn't quite do the trick) it had almost five years of civil war that lasted until late 1922 and broke their economy until the 30s or so.  In other words, from the late 1800s to the early 1930s, Russia wasn't in much condition to go after *anyone*.\n\nJust as Russia had finally recovered from WWI and the Russian Civil War and was finally into some pretty spectacular industrial growth, they promptly got dragged into WWII and got completely wrecked again.  How bad?  They lost over 25 million people in a country of 170 million (with some questionable counting), about 15% of the total population not counting living casualties (i.e. maimed/disabled).  The Soviets did eventually win out thanks to a policy of \"we have more warm bodies to throw than they do,\" and they (astonishingly) managed to exit the war as a rising global superpower on par with the Americans.  This leads into the second period you may be thinking of, the Cold War era.  Besides the fact that pretty much nobody was invading anybody by that point, you may be forgetting Canada's postwar position.  Despite starting the war with few military resources, they ended it with one of the largest air and naval forces worldwide, easily in the top five.  They couldn't have matched U.S./S.R. production, but they were far from defenseless and had a knack for diplomacy: even without the U.S., any aggression against Canada would have led to a massive response in Europe (remember the part where Canada was a major founding member of NATO?) and yet another Soviet flop.  Yes, Canada did disarm fairly quickly, but only *because* the U.S. was around; without the U.S., Canada would likely have remained militarized and played a northern bass line for the Europeans in the \"Russia, shut up\" chorus.  Finally, let's not forget that the only reason Canada had to worry at *all* was its position directly *between* large belligerents.  Without U.S. involvement, Europe would likely have become the second player in the nuclear chicken game (unless, of course, Canada stepped up), and Canada wouldn't have had much to worry about in the first place.\n\nTL;DR: Russia has never posed a serious threat to Canada regardless of U.S. involvement, and if they'd ever tried anything there are plenty of countries that would have knocked their teeth out even if the Americans politely declined to."}, {"id": "2qe327", "body": "I love Canada and Canadians.

These are completely separate from the kernel and can run the same on any kernel.\n\nYou know what the most popular version of Linux for regular  users is? Android. The difference is that while Android uses the same kernel as the Linux you're thinking about, it has a completely different windowing system and all the other non-kernel parts of the OS.\n\nThus the kernel doesn't actually matter for the vast majority of people, and if a complete version of GNU/hurd was released tomorrow you wouldn't be able to tell the difference because it would run the same OS as GNU/Linux.\n\nEdit: Just to add, that GNU bit before Linux is important. GNU is the operating system, while Linux is the kernel that the operating system runs on. GNU was actually written before Linux or Hurd was even started, and one of the reasons that the Linux kernel became popular was that the Linux kernel was developed quicker and was able to run the GNU operating system sooner. Because the Linux kernel gave people a way of running the GNU operating system earlier than Hurd everyone just started using GNU/Linux, and so a lot of development effort switched to improving Linux for running GNU rather than finishing Hurd.\n\nThe combination of GNU and the windowing system (Gnome/KDE) is the equivalent of Windows/Mac OS, while Linux just gives GNU and the windowing system something to run on."}, {"id": "cn5fccr", "body": "As I said, GNU Linux is too liteweight.

It pays it's 5 laborers with $1000/month. The profits is $10000 dollars per month, so $5000 goes to the laborers salaries and $5000 in the owner's pocket.\n\n\n\nIn come the immigrants from poor countries, which find a $500 dollar salary very attractive. They can do with this because they are used to living in shitty conditions and being frugal. The company hires them, and the owner now has $7500 in his pocket monthly. \n\n\n\nNow the immigrants are lowering the wages, because recently nobody would work for less than $1000, now they have 2 options: be unemployed or hop on the bandwagon. There are too many people and not enough jobs.\n\n\n\nOf course, with more profits, the company can afford to make a new production line and create more jobs. But these jobs are also payed with $500/month instead of $1000/month. So more money for the owner.\n\n\n\nThe sole beneficiary of this is the factory owner, who gets cheap labor at the same quality. Also, the immigrants are sending part of their money home, thus taking money out of the economy.\n\n\n\nShouldn't the government protect it's own citizens? Because not everybody has a business and relies on cheap labor to have bigger profits, you will always find unskilled labor in developed countries. The only reason they are paid less is that there is lots of it. I think the majority of people would prefer an office job than doing manual labor, yet office jobs are paid more, because there isn't such a big supply of skilled people.

According to this [report](http://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers-1.pdf):\n\n&gt; Recent evidence shows that immigration is likely to boost firm productivity and the wages of native workers in the\nlong run by stimulating firm growth and contributing a range of skills and ideas. More open immigration policies, which\nallow for balanced entry of immigrants of different education and skill levels, are likely to have no adverse effects on native\nworkers\u2019 wages and may pave the way for productivity growth.\n\n&gt;...     \n\n&gt;While the simplest labor\u2013demand labor\u2013supply model predicts that more immigrants in the\nlabor market depress wages of national workers, several refinements of that model imply no\neffect or positive effect. Empirical studies typically fail to find significant effects of immigration\non the wages of native-born workers\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Firms can reduce labor costs by hiring immigrant workers at a lower wage with respect to\nnatives. Firms then take advantage of this cost cut by creating complementarity/support\njobs largely filled by native-born workers, who will not experience job losses or wage cuts.  \n\nBut you do have a point in that lower-skill workers are often the most impacted, as shown by research from [here](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/labour-market-effects-immigration):\n\n&gt;UK studies find that immigration has small impact on average wages but more significant impacts along the wage distribution: low-waged workers lose while medium and high-paid workers gain\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;The effects of immigration on workers within specific wage ranges or in specific occupations are more significant. The greatest wage effects are found for low-waged workers. Dustmann et al (2013) find that each 1% increase in the share of migrants in the UK-born working age population leads to a 0.6% decline in the wages of the 5% lowest paid workers and to an increase in the wages of higher paid workers. Similarly, another study focusing on wage effects at the occupational level during 1992 and 2006, found that, in the unskilled and semi-skilled service sector, a 1% rise in the share of migrants reduced average wages in that occupation by 0.5% (Nickell and Salaheen 2008).\n\n&gt; The available research further shows that any adverse wage effects of immigration are likely to be greatest for resident workers who are themselves migrants. This is because the skills of new migrants are likely to be closer substitutes for the skills of migrants already employed in the UK than for those of UK-born workers. Manacorda, Manning and Wadsworth (2012) analyse data from 1975-2005 and conclude that the main impact of increased immigration is on the wages of migrants already in the UK.   \n\nSo in a sense, while the losers are often the old migrant low-wage workers to the new, the winners are the mid and high wage earners in the expansion of jobs and wages (to a minor degree). And one thing to understand about economics (economic politics especially) is that there will always inevitably be winners and losers.\n\nSo I think another thing you really have to consider is are there added benefits to these migrant workers coming in that help us? And the answer is almost always yes.\n\nFor instance, looking at your country of the UK:\n\n&gt;Over the period from 2001 to 2011, European immigrants from the EU-15 countries contributed 64% more in taxes than they received in benefits. - See more at: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration#sthash.B13QlkaG.dpuf\n\nOr this:\n\n&gt;The projections, contained within a paper published on Monday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), are the result of academics modelling the current Conservative party migration target to reduce net migration \"from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands\". The research estimates that by 2060, UK GDP would be 11% lower than it would be otherwise.\n\n&gt; The think tank wrote: \"Achieving [the Conservative] target would require reducing recent net migration numbers by a factor of about two ... The results show that such a significant reduction in net migration has strong negative effects on the economy. By 2060 the levels of both GDP and GDP per person fall by 11% and 2.7% respectively. Moreover, this policy has a significant impact on public finances. To keep the government budget balanced, the effective labour income tax rate has to be increased by 2.2 percentage points in the lower migration scenario.\"  [http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/04/reducing-immigration-slow-uk-economy-tax-rises] \n\nSo it really speaks back to some of the earlier points made that immigrant labor boosts job growth (particularly for mid to high wage workers) that help spur the economy along.\n\nYes, there will be some inevitable losers in this agreement but the *overall* benefit to the UK (and any nation really) is great.

One example: In many southern US states with large Mexican immigrant populations, they often gravitate to construction. There are still some construction jobs available for US citizens, because they speak fluent English and have access to certification courses, but the immigrant workers also displace many Americans from lower skill jobs. Not only are they willing to work for less but they'll work twelve hour days six days a week and be there first thing in the morning Dec. 26. This means houses get built faster at lower cost, increasing supply available. The upshot is that huge numbers of people in the American south can buy homes much more cheaply than they would otherwise.

The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents.  Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men didn't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later.\n\nAre we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks?

Jesus is born into poverty *on purpose*. Its not to show off how stingy or poor his parents are or how mean the innkeepers were. Its a huge deal in christianity that Jesus didn't show up as people might expect God to, by coming as some glorious and powerful king that everybody is in awe of. He showed up as a little baby born to peasants and the first people who came to worship him were shepherds instead of powerful priests. In the Bible, Jesus upends the entire existing power structure of the Jewish leaders and tells people that the rich are hypocrites and the poor are the ones that God truly favors. This is why its a huge deal that Jesus is born in a freaking barn rather than descending from a mountain or whatever.\n\nThe primary image of the christmas story in the actual bible is one of humility and is a huge indictment of the existing religious power structures. The point of the story isn't \"look at how few rooms there were\". The point of the story is \"God came to earth in a wholly unexpected way\". The nativity scene helps reinforce this idea. It has nothing to do with painting Jews as stingy."}]}
