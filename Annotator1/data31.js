In wider society, though, tolerance of religious offense basically comes down to lingering vestiges of theocratic control, religion's ongoing (and largely undue) influence in politics, and a tacit agreement between members of religions that \"we'll tolerate you being offended on your religious grounds if you'll tolerate us being offended on ours because otherwise neither of us get to be and the atheists win.\"  All three of these things depend on a religion's ability to exert non-religious influence through its followers, a power largely restricted to large and established religions, and their effectiveness is defined far more by the religion's role as a social institution than some general respect for religious beliefs.\n\nIn other words, it's not necessarily about how socially acceptable a belief is, but how big a stick the relevant group of believers wields.

The otherkin who keep it to themselves (or simply don't behave in a disruptive or harmful manner) *don't* suffer from a mental disorder (after all, their belief isn't really hurting anyone), while the otherkin whose belief causes significant disruption in their and others' lives *do*."}, {"id": "cn8wudm", "body": "I don't think you realize what the DSM 4 means by \"disruptive.\""}, {"id": "cn8wudm", "body": "I don't think you realize what the DSM 4 means by \"disruptive.\""}, {"id": "cn9gni0", "body": "I do, I just made the mistake of using \"disruption\" in the colloquial sense as well.

I'll refer again to my example above: the catkin's issues would likely qualify as a disorder (as they'd provide a significant barrier to normal function) while the pigkin's would not (as it does not).  \n\nHowever, if you feel you have a better understanding of the way in which the DSM IV uses \"disruptive,\" perhaps you should explain it rather than asking us to take your word for it.\n\n\\* Specifically, grandiose type delusional disorder."}, {"id": "cn8suhj", "body": "&gt; unless they started disrupting the lives of others.\n\nHerein is where the problem lies.

We all ostracize others to some degree based on behaviors we find distasteful. Being socially isolated is not, in and of itself, reason enough to intervene in someone's choices or behaviors. If you examine the criteria in the DSM you'll find that there really have to be pretty significant circumstances present in order for a disorder to be diagnosed, and those are outlined and specific to the disorder in question.\n\nThere is an element (historically speaking) of social acceptability that is involved in the criteria for mental disorders, which has changed over time. You can see this really well illustrated in the history of diagnosis and treatment of homosexuality. Homosexuality was once listed in the DSM as a mental disorder, but that changed as a result of both the prevailing social attitudes and overwhelming research which demonstrated that merely identifying as homosexual did not have any significant aberrant effects on a person's life and that in general homosexuals were otherwise as psychologically well adjusted as anyone else.\n\nMy point is that over time what is considered relevant in terms of diagnosis has changed as the result of better research and prevailing social attitudes. Religion, for instance, enjoys a bit of a protected status in our culture when talking about delusions because of its social prevalence, and so you wouldn't typically associate religion itself with evidence of a mental disorder.\n\nOverall psychologists have tried to move away from allowing the prevailing social milieu to direct the conversation about what constitutes a mental disorder and move towards a field that is more data and research driven in terms of what constitutes a disorder and what does not.\n\nAs I mentioned before, just because you find a particular behavior distasteful, doesn't mean others do. Just because you may be ostracized by many people, doesn't mean you're ostracized by all. You might consider that there are certain social benefits conferred onto those who demonstrate fringe behaviors (especially given that many such individuals have often found that they have difficulty fitting in neatly anywhere else in society). In other words, Maybe a large swath of society looks down on movements like otherkins, but within that social group, there may be benefits to the very behaviors you dislike (including the solidarity with others who may be within your group and the sense of unique self that comes from defining one's self as distinct from the rest of the prevailing world).\n\nOtherkin just really aren't that unique as far as fringe social movements go, and again, if someone identifying as otherkin does have a legitimate mental disorder, then there is already a criteria in place for evaluating this."}, {"id": "cn985v3", "body": "This is a good answer, but let me just play the devil's advocate here...\n\nCouldn't someone make the argument that these people are indeed disruptive because their otherkin behavior ostracizes them from others?

A car in cross traffic, who has the right of way, stops short to avoid being hit by Bob.\n\nIf you're like most people, you'll agree that Bob manifested bad driving, and if he does this regularly, he's a bad driver. You'd expect him to say something like \"I'm lucky I didn't cause an accident or get a ticket.\" You'd consider him an idiot if he said something like \"That other car almost got itself hit.\" Short of a sudden heart attack or faulty brakes, you'd think there's really no excuse for what Bob did.\n\nNow replace running a red light with failing to yield to a pedestrian at a crosswalk. My view is that you should judge Bob the same as in the previous scenario. Yet I've repeatedly seen drivers failing to yield at crosswalks, only to repudiate blame: \"These pedestrians don't seem to realize I can't see them until it's too late. They're going to get themselves hit.\"\n\nMy view is, if you're a good driver, you'll slow down when approaching crosswalks to whatever speed is necessary for you to yield to any pedestrians. If this is impossible for you, then you're too impaired to be driving. If nothing else, you can come to a complete stop at all crosswalks. You might get honked at, but you can withstand that.\n\nTo qualify:\n\n1. My view pertains to the USA, where I have experience. It might be otherwise somewhere with different driving laws and customs.\n2. For simplicity, limit the scenario to unsignalized crosswalks without a crossing guard or traffic officer on scene.\n3. My view is not about any legal distinction. That's easily settled. The two offenses have comparable penalties in most jurisdictions.\n4. My view is not about how pedestrians should behave. Obviously, don't cross if it's not safe.\n5. I'll admit an exception if a pedestrian does something like hide behind a mailbox and suddenly jump out. Such exceptions are extremely rare in real life, though.\n\nWhy do I hold this view? It's pretty straightforward: being a good driver means following traffic laws and not endangering others. This is no exception.\n\nWhy do I doubt this view? Because of otherwise good, perspicacious drivers who seem to disagree. As I seldom drive, I may be overlooking something pertinent.\n\nEDIT (after 24 hours): suffice to say my view has not changed in any way, but I appreciate everyone who took the time to respond. Thank you!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

A car in cross traffic, who has the right of way, stops short to avoid being hit by Bob.\n\nIf you're like most people, you'll agree that Bob manifested bad driving, and if he does this regularly, he's a bad driver. You'd expect him to say something like \"I'm lucky I didn't cause an accident or get a ticket.\" You'd consider him an idiot if he said something like \"That other car almost got itself hit.\" Short of a sudden heart attack or faulty brakes, you'd think there's really no excuse for what Bob did.\n\nNow replace running a red light with failing to yield to a pedestrian at a crosswalk. My view is that you should judge Bob the same as in the previous scenario. Yet I've repeatedly seen drivers failing to yield at crosswalks, only to repudiate blame: \"These pedestrians don't seem to realize I can't see them until it's too late. They're going to get themselves hit.\"\n\nMy view is, if you're a good driver, you'll slow down when approaching crosswalks to whatever speed is necessary for you to yield to any pedestrians. If this is impossible for you, then you're too impaired to be driving. If nothing else, you can come to a complete stop at all crosswalks. You might get honked at, but you can withstand that.\n\nTo qualify:\n\n1. My view pertains to the USA, where I have experience. It might be otherwise somewhere with different driving laws and customs.\n2. For simplicity, limit the scenario to unsignalized crosswalks without a crossing guard or traffic officer on scene.\n3. My view is not about any legal distinction. That's easily settled. The two offenses have comparable penalties in most jurisdictions.\n4. My view is not about how pedestrians should behave. Obviously, don't cross if it's not safe.\n5. I'll admit an exception if a pedestrian does something like hide behind a mailbox and suddenly jump out. Such exceptions are extremely rare in real life, though.\n\nWhy do I hold this view? It's pretty straightforward: being a good driver means following traffic laws and not endangering others. This is no exception.\n\nWhy do I doubt this view? Because of otherwise good, perspicacious drivers who seem to disagree. As I seldom drive, I may be overlooking something pertinent.\n\nEDIT (after 24 hours): suffice to say my view has not changed in any way, but I appreciate everyone who took the time to respond.

While women were on average happier than men in the 70s, reliable data shows that this gap is closing, but also that women nowadays are less happier than 40 years ago.\n\nFor people eager to find flaws in that study, please refer to the link posted at the bottom. To quote the abstract: \n&gt;  The paradox of women's declining relative well-being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well-being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries.   \n\n\n\nHaving had a cursory look at the main body of the study, it seems to be that nobody really knows why. Although the authors do not attempt to provide a definite answer, they list a few possible explanations, among them one that goes something like this: \n\nDue to societal change, our conceptions about women's roles have changed. This, in turn, led to rising expectations from women towards their own lives. The modern woman does not only want to be a good mother, but also strives to excel at her job. When these aspirations are not fully realized, these women feel disappointed and as a result unhappy. \n\nThe authors also note that women in Europe are still happier than men, although this gap is closing as well.\n\nSo the view I'd like to be challenged is this: The changes which were brought about by feminism have not benefited women. While they earn more than they used to, and have more opportunities to succeed in their life, they have become unhappier.   Thus the so-called achievements of feminism should not be regarded as such. \n\nHere the study: http://www.nber.org/papers/w14969 (the full text can be downloaded as well) \n\nedit: Ok, I think this discussion has come to an end. \n\nAttempts to change my view have focused mainly on two points: \n\nA: My hypothesis as to why happiness is declining is not backed up by enough data, and my claim is therefore weak, as also other factors can be considered. \n\nThese people have managed to change my views at least partially, by citing the increased exposure to idealized body images which disproportionately targets women as a possible explanation.  \n\nStill, I maintain that the life satisfaction of women has declined while a group is still claiming to have significantly improved circumstances for females. \nOn the other hand this signifies that maybe some men should not complain so much and get in arms about feminism as having a negative impact on their lives. \n\nB: The second line of argument was to debate whether life satisfaction is a valid metric to assess whether societal improvements have been made for this group. It has especially been mentioned that the decline in happiness might only be temporary, and an almost necessary step towards the full attainment of feminist goals. First awareness needs to be established and only afterwards the desired equality can be reached. \n\nThis did not manage to sway me. I continue to think that life satisfaction is a better metric than the more commonly used materialistic metrics such as wealth, or access to power. Until the feminist movement actually succeeds in reversing this trend, I remain skeptical. In conclusion, I think that if my theory is right, we have to applaud feminism for achieving their goal of equality at least in one aspect. \n\nGood night\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If we accept the \"rising expectations\" hypothesis, we assume that women feel unhappy because they do not *achieve* as much in their life as they would want to. So that is an individual's dissatisfaction with their life. The question of universal suffrage, however, is not related to individual success, thus a woman who wants to vote but can't, will not feel as a failure. \n\nWhat it all comes down to is the following question: Do we value power over happiness? This is the implicit assumption of most discussions on that topic: Women can't vote, so they have less power, and this is inherently bad. \nHowever, I think that this question is rather irrelevant. What matters is happiness and satisfaction with life. Let's just assume that women's happiness was in fact not hampered by the fact that they could not vote. In that case, I dont see why I should be bothered about this. \n\nAs a contrast, take the happiness of the Afro-American community. While on average still lower than Caucasian people's happiness, it has improved hugely over the last 30 years.

A woman born in the 90's who is in college today has many more opportunities and protections than a woman in 1970.

I.e., a 2014 woman has far less disadvantages now compared to then.\n\n*However*, the last 40 years have given rise to a much higher perception and acknowledgement of inequalities. So a 2014 woman is much more aware of the differences that are of a much smaller magnitude.\n\nThis awareness bias could also play into the diminished sense of happiness that the study observed.\n\nAs women in general have become more and more informed participants in society over the decades, they have been more and more fed up with the continued observed deficits in opportunity.\n\nSo the differential could be an \"ignorance *was* bliss\" problem.\n\n"}, {"id": "cn8o897", "body": "Fair enough: But you are obligated to explain why these changes affected women negatively, while they did not affect men.

Feminism is about destroying a political and economic arrangement called Patriarchy. Patriarchy takes an otherwise insignificant biological trait-one's sex-and turns it into something that has social significance, with men dominating women. Feminists seek to destroy this social arrangement by seeking equality for women from sports to the workplace, pushing for reproductive rights, and challenging everyday Patriarchal behavior that oppresses women, such as sexual harassment, pornography, prostitution, and rape.\n\nThe argument that feminism has made women less happy is a similar argument the Duck Dynasty guy made regarding blacks-that they were happier singin' and pickin' cotton in the Old South. As if emancipation and Civil Rights have anything to do with happiness. Destroying power structures and challenging the status quo is a miserable affair. Usually, many people die or spend time in prison, and if those challenges are escalated, they can lead to all-out war. But challenging power structures like Male Supremacism or White Supremacism are fought by those who hold their own dignity and ability to direct their own lives more dear than happiness.\n\n"}, {"id": "2qqtuj", "body": "Unbeknownst to most feminists and probably the general population, the Feminist movement has succeeded in eradicating the gap between men and women in happiness.

They know what their goals are supposed to be, so when they achieve them they are satisfied. \nI don't think that means it is detrimental to give people possibilities or just to restrict their freedoms - both on the principle of the idea, and because it will always be harmful to the percentage of the population that isn't like that. Would you consider it 'detrimental' to give people the choice of whether or not to view world news about famine and war, on the grounds that it is likely to negatively impact their happiness? Would it be beneficial to restrict that from anyone whom it wouldn't directly benefit?\n\nI would also say that there are more, complicating factors at play. Feminism has given women greater access to the world they live in. That world's kind of shitty. But I wouldn't say that it's because of feminism that women are less happy. As some have mentioned, we currently are experience conflict between women's new roles (as members of the work force) and their old roles (homemaker). Women now have to reach an ideal of \"doing it all\" instead of doing one or the other. There's also the fact that the world has changed around feminism: a family with a single breadwinner is no longer feasible for most Americans. Workers have to do more to get by, and those workers now include women. The world is becoming more urbanized and people more isolated. Our lifestyles are more sedentary, our economy more service-based, and our media more focused on sensational disastors and terrorist threats. None of this is because of feminism.\n\n\nWe also have to ask if the way in which people perceive their own happiness is changed, and to what extent a person's happiness is even effected by the world outside their day-to-day lives, or by things that are beneficial to them. (i.e. if you were to compare my happiness before and after receiving vaccinations, or introducing more spinach into my diet, you might not find those things are beneficial, even though I think we would probably agree that they are). Happiness can even be more chemical than it is based on our life circumstances, and there is viable research to show that most people have an average level of happiness, regardless of how well their life is going. Maybe a change in women's diets has effected the way their brain chemistry works. Maybe it's in their genes somehow.

This got me thinking about \"Animals\", because while I find the song catchy and great, I sadly think it promotes rape culture.  I would like to be wrong so I can actually listen to the song and enjoy it!\n\nI will start at the beginning of the song and work my way through in order, saving the overall comparison of humans to animals for the end.\n\n*\"Baby, I'm preying on you tonight\nHunt you down eat you alive\"*\n\nThis portion of the song expresses an aggressive pursuit and the plans behind an eventual capture of a woman, who by the end of the encounter is greatly injured (possibly dies) through being \u201ceaten alive\u201d.  The double meaning that could be applied here of eating a girl out for pleasure reinforces the sexual nature of this attack (I use this term because when you hunt something down, following you attack it)  \n\n\n*\"Maybe you think that you can hide\nI can smell your scent from miles\u201d*\n\nThese lyrics reinforce the idea that she cannot escape him, he will have his way with her no matter what she does to stop it.  The very fact that it is mentioned that she may want to hide from him gives us enough reason to argue that she is not consenting.  \n\n\n*\"So what you trying to do to me\nIt's like we can't stop we're enemies\nBut we get along when I'm inside you\nYou're like a drug that's killing me\nI cut you out entirely\nBut I get so high when I'm inside you\u201d*\n\nThis section has the female objectified by comparing her to a drug.  She is something that he uses to get high, something that brings him pleasure and him alone pleasure.  While the third line says that \u201cwe get along when I\u2019m inside you\u201d this is his perception and can easily be read as the females submission to the act now that it is happening again.  While the word \u201cwe\u201d in both of its uses above wants us to believe that she is consenting, it is clear that the speaker is obsessed with her and that his intentions are centered around himself.  While rapists never see themselves as rapists, it makes sense that he would discuss this from the perspective of \u201cwe\u201d, assuming her consent like he has always done.  \n\n\n*\"Yeah, you can start over, you can run free\nYou can find other fish in the sea\nYou can pretend it's meant to be\nBut you can't stay away from me\nI can still hear you making that sound\nTaking me down, rolling on the ground\nYou can pretend that it was me\nBut no\"*\n\nAgain, this idea that she can run away from him, but she can\u2019t stay away.  While it could be interpreted as she desires him, so she comes back, the earlier points I have addressed strongly push against this idea.  The obsessive idea plays into this passage strongly as well.  He discusses all the things that she could do (start over, run free, find other fish) but how in the end he is the right answer for her, and even if she thinks otherwise (You can pretend it\u2019s meant to be) she is wrong.  This passage asserts that her opinions, her thoughts, and her saying no doesn\u2019t matter, because he knows what she wants, he has already defined this for her.  The \u201cTaking me down, rolling on the ground\u201d portion is seen by the male to be playful and all part of the fun, but, geared with the knowledge of his obsession and her trying to escape him, from her perspective this is her attempt at the initial part of intimacy to get away.  She tries to push him down, tries to get away but she can\u2019t and he takes control.  \n\n\n*\"So if I run it's not enough \nYou're still in my head forever stuck \nSo you can do what you wanna do\nI love your lies, I'll eat 'em up \nBut don't deny the animal \nThat comes alive when I'm inside you\"*\n\n*\"Don't tell no lie-lie-lie-lie\nYou can't deny-ny-ny-ny\nThe beast inside-side-side-side\"*\n\n*\"No, girl, don't lie-lie-lie-lie\"*\n\nThe first potion is dealing with the male trying to get over his obsession, and failing.  Again, he gives her permission to do what she will, even though she doesn\u2019t need his permission.  Then he discusses, in multiple sections, the \u201clies\" that this woman is presenting.  Regardless of what the \u201clies\" are, most likely something about her wanting him to stop chasing her, they reinforce that anything she says he discards.  He discusses her denying the animal/beast that she becomes when having sex with him.  This implies aggression during sex, and really nothing more.  Why would she be aggressive?  In an effort to hurt him, in an effort to stop getting raped.  \n\n\nThe entire song hides under the comparison that they are animals \"Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals\u201d is repeated often.  From this, thoughts of \u201cnatural instinct\u201d etc. come to mind.  This fails to justify the gross depictions the other lyrics create because people, while animals, are so much more developed that we do not tolerate rape.  Rape is not justified simply because reproduction results from it, because we fulfilled our \u201cnatural instinct\u201d.  That is potentially another debate for another time, my only point here is that the song\u2019s comparison to animals does not make it OK to promote rape culture.  \n\nMy apologies for the length of this, but I wanted to build up my argument clearly so that I could address all the elements of the song and not need to develop it later in discussion.\n\n**TL;DR** I think that this song promotes rape culture.  Above are the song lyrics analyzed in support for my stance.  \n\nThoughts?\n\n**Edit** Formatting\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This got me thinking about \"Animals\", because while I find the song catchy and great, I sadly think it promotes rape culture.  I would like to be wrong so I can actually listen to the song and enjoy it!\n\nI will start at the beginning of the song and work my way through in order, saving the overall comparison of humans to animals for the end.\n\n*\"Baby, I'm preying on you tonight\nHunt you down eat you alive\"*\n\nThis portion of the song expresses an aggressive pursuit and the plans behind an eventual capture of a woman, who by the end of the encounter is greatly injured (possibly dies) through being \u201ceaten alive\u201d.  The double meaning that could be applied here of eating a girl out for pleasure reinforces the sexual nature of this attack (I use this term because when you hunt something down, following you attack it)  \n\n\n*\"Maybe you think that you can hide\nI can smell your scent from miles\u201d*\n\nThese lyrics reinforce the idea that she cannot escape him, he will have his way with her no matter what she does to stop it.  The very fact that it is mentioned that she may want to hide from him gives us enough reason to argue that she is not consenting.  \n\n\n*\"So what you trying to do to me\nIt's like we can't stop we're enemies\nBut we get along when I'm inside you\nYou're like a drug that's killing me\nI cut you out entirely\nBut I get so high when I'm inside you\u201d*\n\nThis section has the female objectified by comparing her to a drug.  She is something that he uses to get high, something that brings him pleasure and him alone pleasure.  While the third line says that \u201cwe get along when I\u2019m inside you\u201d this is his perception and can easily be read as the females submission to the act now that it is happening again.  While the word \u201cwe\u201d in both of its uses above wants us to believe that she is consenting, it is clear that the speaker is obsessed with her and that his intentions are centered around himself.  While rapists never see themselves as rapists, it makes sense that he would discuss this from the perspective of \u201cwe\u201d, assuming her consent like he has always done.  \n\n\n*\"Yeah, you can start over, you can run free\nYou can find other fish in the sea\nYou can pretend it's meant to be\nBut you can't stay away from me\nI can still hear you making that sound\nTaking me down, rolling on the ground\nYou can pretend that it was me\nBut no\"*\n\nAgain, this idea that she can run away from him, but she can\u2019t stay away.  While it could be interpreted as she desires him, so she comes back, the earlier points I have addressed strongly push against this idea.  The obsessive idea plays into this passage strongly as well.  He discusses all the things that she could do (start over, run free, find other fish) but how in the end he is the right answer for her, and even if she thinks otherwise (You can pretend it\u2019s meant to be) she is wrong.  This passage asserts that her opinions, her thoughts, and her saying no doesn\u2019t matter, because he knows what she wants, he has already defined this for her.  The \u201cTaking me down, rolling on the ground\u201d portion is seen by the male to be playful and all part of the fun, but, geared with the knowledge of his obsession and her trying to escape him, from her perspective this is her attempt at the initial part of intimacy to get away.  She tries to push him down, tries to get away but she can\u2019t and he takes control.  \n\n\n*\"So if I run it's not enough \nYou're still in my head forever stuck \nSo you can do what you wanna do\nI love your lies, I'll eat 'em up \nBut don't deny the animal \nThat comes alive when I'm inside you\"*\n\n*\"Don't tell no lie-lie-lie-lie\nYou can't deny-ny-ny-ny\nThe beast inside-side-side-side\"*\n\n*\"No, girl, don't lie-lie-lie-lie\"*\n\nThe first potion is dealing with the male trying to get over his obsession, and failing.  Again, he gives her permission to do what she will, even though she doesn\u2019t need his permission.  Then he discusses, in multiple sections, the \u201clies\" that this woman is presenting.  Regardless of what the \u201clies\" are, most likely something about her wanting him to stop chasing her, they reinforce that anything she says he discards.  He discusses her denying the animal/beast that she becomes when having sex with him.  This implies aggression during sex, and really nothing more.  Why would she be aggressive?  In an effort to hurt him, in an effort to stop getting raped.  \n\n\nThe entire song hides under the comparison that they are animals \"Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals\u201d is repeated often.  From this, thoughts of \u201cnatural instinct\u201d etc. come to mind.  This fails to justify the gross depictions the other lyrics create because people, while animals, are so much more developed that we do not tolerate rape.  Rape is not justified simply because reproduction results from it, because we fulfilled our \u201cnatural instinct\u201d.  That is potentially another debate for another time, my only point here is that the song\u2019s comparison to animals does not make it OK to promote rape culture.  \n\nMy apologies for the length of this, but I wanted to build up my argument clearly so that I could address all the elements of the song and not need to develop it later in discussion.\n\n**TL;DR** I think that this song promotes rape culture.

There is no \"thrill of the hunt\" in shooting a lion from several meters in an armored jeep. If a human wants to hunt for sport, there should be a real chance of failure or injury in taking trophies. Neanderthals did not have throwing spears, only thrusting spears. This meant that they had to get very close to their quarry when hunting. As you can imagine, they were frequently trampled and gored by large animals. In my opinion, this is the most fair way to hunt and shows due respect to the quarry. If done at all, this is how sport hunting should be done.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You can't hold that killing an animal in a hunt with a big stick is ok, but doing so with a bullet is not on the grounds of \"fairness\" unless you would contend that a group of people mugging some person on the street is fair -- for both involve the same level of consent from the victim. \n\nI honestly can not understand the very basis for the position.

I can't remember which way around it was, but earlier this year Churchill and Girton had about a foot between them for almost a kilometer of the course and there didn't end up being a bump.\n\nOnce there has been a bump, both boats pull over and allow the rest of the race to pass them. The next day, the boats are swapped in the start order. Obviously, this means that it can take many years to climb up the rankings.\n\nThere isn't usually too much damage unless you are complete muppets ([Watch the crew in red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97-NclfkuM0) here.) but coxes conceding too late will often get a blade to the back."}, {"id": "cn8l0bv", "body": "Huh.

For this reason, it isn't uncommon to see old people run marathons. \n\nD) As I explained before, running does involve the entire body. of course, runners use the lower body more than the upper body, but the same is true for swimmers in reverse (they use more upper than lower)\n\nIt should be noted that this is an apples to oranges comparison. There is no definitive answer to this question. The best way to exercise is to not specialize in only one thing. It all depends on what you want from your exercise.

Swimming is a powerful form of exercise, and if you are able to do so, it is probably the best bang for your buck.\n\nBut swimming is a learned skill.  Most people, with no prior exposure, would very likely drown without supervision in the water.\n\nIt also requires something to swim in.  Which you addressed, by pretty casually let slip by.  It's hard to go swimming in a desert, or empty grasslands, or in the mountains.\n\nWalking is an innate ability.  Infants self-teach walking. It's a sign of development.  You can walk everywhere (except on water, haha) and with varrying degrees of difficulty.\n\nSwimming is difficult, period.  All of the points you made: Whole body, muscle group resistance, high cardio...also make it difficult. I feel it's fair to say that swimming certainly has a certain minimum fitness requirement.  Walking's minimum requirement is much lower.\n\nObviously \"best\" is kind of opinion oriented as well.  I agree that swimming is probably the best form or cardio exercise, but not necessarily the best strength builder.\n\nFor me, \"best\", at least in the form of exercise, is probably going to constitute efficiency.  What has the least amount of inputs, yet manages to generate the most desirable outputs.\n\nUnder these criteria, Walking is \"The Best\".  Walking is innate - we all know how to do it.  It's easy, both on the body, and to perform.  Best of wall, regular walking brings with it all the benefits of regular exercise.\n\nAre the benefits as much as running, weight lifting, swimming, etc. ? No, all of those tend to perform better than walking, but they also come with caveats.  Running a lot can wreck your knees, swimming too much can cause shoulder problems, weight lifting can cause numerous injuries due to bad form or equipment.\n\nIt's risk/reward situation.  And in that light, walking is easily the least risky exercise to perform, while still providing essentially all of the rewards and benefits of regular exercise.\n\nAn individual with a regular walking regimen is going to benefit from that exercise substantially, while incurring very few risks."}, {"id": "2qqa7z", "body": "While obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being, if someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique, there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming.
