It is known for a fact the suspect has information needed to prevent a future suspected terrorist attack that has the potential to take more than a few civilian lives. They know the location of a planned bombing. They know the location of a terror leader. They know plans or other privileged information that if obtained has a good chance to stop an attack or capture very dangerous people capable and willing to plan an attack. If we're uncertain they have this information then we must stick to standard interrogation methods.\n\n2. The \"torture\" can have no lasting major ill effects. Water boarding, while shitty, poses no threat to a person's life and their life returns to normal once it's over. The same goes with sleep deprivation, using superstition / religion (rubbing a person in pig blood), and other forms of minor mental or physical fuckery. Rape, extreme humiliation, or body mutilation (no ripping off a persons finger) things would continue to be banned. The suspect should require minimum to no medical intervention after the \"torture\" is complete. \n\n3. It can only be used to gather information on a future crime, but not coerce a confession of a past crime. Gaining confessions using torture serves no purpose and I believe that's commonly agreed upon. Information gained during these interrogations can not be used in a court room or legal proceeding. Even though, by proxy, if a suspect gives up detailed information of a planned bombing that proves they were involved in the bombing, that information can't be used in a court. \n\n4.

Everything I've read on the topic, with evidence behind it, seems to support that torture is not a reliable way to acquire information. And it is wrong independent of any good that might come from information required. Theoretically the saving a number of lives might be worth some torture, but it seems very hard to craft a policy that would balance that facts that A) torture will almost never work in practice and B) the situations it might be worth doing IF it worked are so rare, they might only happen (wild speculation:) every decade.\n\nSo coming from the perspective a policy that outright outlaws torture, but then in a rare case it could be proven beneficial (after the fact) allows it as an exception seems reasonable provided that policy worked in practice (public-choice theory and fuck-up theory taken into account). It does though, as Dershowitz points out in the article above put security agents in an untenable position. But unlike him, I accept this since to the risk to allow torture in a more formalized form seem to me to be much more open to abuse."}, {"id": "2qpz8z", "body": "I believe the US, or any country, should be allowed to use interrogation methods some may consider torture under the following simple guidelines: \n\n1.

What constitutes being \"uncertain\"? A government, when being questioned for breaking this rule could just say \"We thought he had information\" and come up with some bullshit reason to think the subject had information. \n\nCountries that want to torture people won't be swayed by this rule one bit. \n\n\n&gt;  The same goes with sleep deprivation, using superstition / religion (rubbing a person in pig blood), and other forms of minor mental or physical fuckery.\n\nwhat about damage to a person's brain? Psychological trauma (ie PTSD) can have a lasting effect on a person's brain. This has the potential to *ruin* someone's life. Torturing someone with religion/superstition is just as bad as PTSD. If someone truly believes that the devil is out to get them (or something like that) they can also have Psychological problems for the rest of their lives.\n\n&gt; Gaining confessions using torture serves no purpose and I believe that's commonly agreed upon. \n\nYes, it's commonly agreed upon because people will say *anything* to make the pain (physical or otherwise) stop. This applies to future crimes as well as confessions.\n\nYou have no way of knowing that your prisoner's information is true. The prisoner could easily say \"the bad guy is in these hills\" while he is really half-way around the world, causing you to spend money and time looking for someone that is not there. Also, If a prisoner doesn't know anything, (again rule 1 isn't really a deterrent) you could go on another goose chase, trying to find someone that isn't there. This is why torture is just really bad at getting information out of people.\n\nThere is also the matter of the morality of torture, the idea that torturing makes us no better (or even worse) than our adversaries. \n\n&gt; The suspect is not a member of a commonly recognized military and acting in that capacity.

You have a computer with the information you need, but some jackass has programmed it so that it will only give you the information you want if you hook up someone to a device of its choosing, where it can cause a negative experience for that person. We'll go with the full range here as to what a \"negative experience\" could be, anywhere from leaving the person bored for a few minutes to Passion of the Christ level misery. What should the maximum amount of discomfort be for it to be justified in your eyes? For yourself (how much would you be willing to sacrifice personally)? For your most hated enemy (how much revenge are you willing to take against someone to correct a wrong before you get too squeamish to hurt them further)? For your most beloved friend/family member/whoever (how far would you go to shield those you care about from pain)? A stranger (to what extent are you willing to hurt someone who means nothing to you for the sake of the greater good)?\n\nLet's say the computer is the one deciding who will be hooked up to this machine. It doesn't tell you ahead of time who it's going to pick, but does tell you it will be one of those four choices. It also tells you that you must be very honest with yourself just exactly how far, how much pain and misery you would be willing to have put against these people in order to obtain this information.\n\nRemember, it is the computer who holds this information, not them. -They know nothing.- This person being forced to undergo this experience is an arbitrary step in the process, but the process cannot be completed without it.\n\nThe computer will read your consciousness beforehand. You must be very honest with yourself as to just how far you are willing to go to get this information. If you are not honest with yourself, if you do not determine the limits of pain, suffering, psychological torture, and so on which you are willing to have inflicted upon another human being - you, your enemy (if you don't have an enemy, just imagine -if- someone had done something horrible enough that it warranted personal enemy status), your beloved, a stranger - you will not get the information you want.\n\nIf you are honest, very honest, that person, whichever one is picked, will go through that experience, and the information will be given to the appropriate people in time to save the day.\n\nSo, think about that for a while.\n\n----\n\nTo answer, does it matter if it works?\n\nWould you submit to the will of a sadistic programmer who enjoys pushing people's buttons like that? They're not even there and they are forcing you into that situation to choose just how badly you are willing to hurt people in order to learn something. Your enemy you might be happy to get the chance at, you might be masochistic enough to enjoy whatever you cook up for yourself, you might be willing to put the fate of a stranger out of your mind for the sake of what you consider more important, but someone you love? Is hurting someone you love what you're willing to do? Why?\n\nThere is another option - not using the machine at all. You will not learn what you needed to, the chips will fall where they may as a result, but you will have chosen another path than to participate in a brutal and cruel system devised by some asshole who enjoys putting people through that sort of thing.\n\nWhat sort of situation would it take to get you to submit to the machine and the will of the sadist who programmed it? Would some situations you'd be ok with, some not? Would your answer always be, \"I'd never submit to that!\" and it would always hold true, or is there a situation, hypothetically, that would leave you so desperate that you would bow down to an instrument of torture?\n\n----\n\nTo answer, what is the real purpose of torture?\n\nIs torture to get information, or is it to intimidate people?\n\n\"Name, rank, serial number.\"\n\nIf you're in the military, you're taught to resist interrogation. Is the information that valuable that you'd go through hell to keep from giving it up? Or is the point of not giving it up to prove that you/your military won't be intimidated, neither by fear of death, nor by fear of cruel and unusual punishment?\n\nMilitary men are trained for this, and you would use it on a cobbled-together militia, chanting \"terrorist\" to justify your cruelty.\n\nIn my opinion, torture is not about saving lives, it's brutality for the sake of brutality. The person being tortured is already incapacitated to even be in a position where it can be done to them, they aren't a threat. And you would use violence against them? Is it really because you think they know something you are that desperate to learn?\n\nShould the FBI be allowed to use torture on the people it has in its custody if they think it might prevent a crime? What would that teach people? \"Never ever do anything that could get you arrested, whether you've done something wrong or not, it doesn't matter, don't do anything that might cause the police to think they should arrest you.\"\n\nAnd with US soldiers torturing people, isn't that the same message they are giving? \"Never ever do anything that makes the United States think you are a 'terrorist', they will capture you and torture you. It doesn't matter whether you've done something wrong or not, just don't do anything that might cause the US to think they should capture you.\"\n\nIt is to incite fear and compliance, not to save people.

Nietzsche is one of my all-time favourite thinkers, and his message is often misunderstood as being nihilistic, whereas in general he is actually opposed to nihilism and suggests a path toward overcoming it.  He certainly understands the drive toward nihilism though; he himself was crippled with multiple ailments to the point where he had to go on the 19th century version of \"disability\" (he received a pension from the university he taught at after retiring early due being unable to continue teaching).  In the end he had to dictate a number of his later works since he couldn't even read anymore.  He knows a lot about suffering, and yet still offers a message of hope and progress toward something better.

It usually means somebody cold and mean. Psychopathy, an actual diagnostic criterion, has mostly to do with antisocial behavior and a lack of empathy. What you described the society as doing is showing empathy.\n\nWhich leads to point number two: This implies that psychopathic behavior is caused by empathy, and in your case, the victims of your unethical behavior. The implication is that if they weren't easy prey, you wouldn't take the posture of a predator. That's a very common delusion among predators, which has to do with blaming the victim, and it has to do with shame (the predator has shame for their own behavior, and projects it onto the perceived weakness of their victim). In reality, all predatory behavior is exploitative, and anything can be exploited. This is why JFK and John Lennon were shot, and why their killers would have delusionally seen themselves as very powerful in doing so.\n\nThe internal delusion is that some sort of \"energy\" transference is occurring in \"dominating\" their victim, and that the victim is at fault for not being invincible at all times. Psychopaths deep down hate their own psychological weakness, as many were abused in childhood and \"broke\" very easily, even to the extent of selling any sense of ethics or pride to their abuser for love, peace, or whatever. So they see life as a sort of numbers game, and think that they can deface people with developed personalities by exploiting them; often with ends in showing how \"phony\" everything is. A sick, non-funny sense of humiliation humor comes with it.\n\nAspects of society, like dark corners of governments, military, individuals and services may have sadistic and ultra-insecure features, but you can hardly call Western society supporting of \"sociopathy\" because some services are displaying empathy. In fact, ignoring psychopaths and showing empathy despite them is exactly how you deal with them, because they cannot be treated. I'd say that the empathetic organizations actually have discouraged psychopathy by not reacting to it, as it's usually after a reaction."}, {"id": "2qpd0d", "body": "Fairly simple cmv, \n\nI find myself lying to companies and services on an almost daily basis as it means I usually get better more for my money. \n\nThe habit begun when I became disabled, I quickly realised that if i mentioned it I would usually receive priority service.

So this will kinda answer your last question as well. \n\nThe point of my relationship is giving myself fully to one person. In this whole world with 7 billion people, there's this one person that's mine and just for me. My best friend, my confidante, my soulmate. For me, there are no two or more people like that at the same time (I believe we have more than one soulmate, if you believe in the concept). Why not? Because I can't give myself like that to several people simultaneously. It's kinda an all or nothing deal. And I gravitate towards people who feel the same. \n\nSo an open relationship doesn't give me that sense of intimacy, belonging and the idea of this person being mine and I theirs. You mention in one of your posts how your wife spends three hours a day with her boyfriend online and you're not missing out on anything. I would be missing out on three hours I could spend with my gf. And because she's talking to her *boyfriend*? Uh...Hell no. Seriously, the very idea is ludicrous and doesn't compute in my brain. Emphasis on my personal bias - this is how it is for me and I'm not implying your lifestyle is wrong, just that there is more than one good one. \n\nAs for hearing about divorce and fails and all that, no matter what it is, we usually hear more about the bad stuff than the good stuff. A plane crash will be on the news for days, but no one bats an eye at the thousands of planes that land safely every day. Same goes for everything else. \n\n&gt; What I see is love wasted for no reason, people suffering and going through ugly breakups for no reason;\n\nAgain, just to reinforce the idea: there's a major reason. Try telling a straight guy there's no reason why he should pass up on an opportunity to date your best male friend. Not to mention that even if you have one of the parties open to it, if the other one isn't it's still a no go. As it should be. No one should be forced to do anything they're not comfortable with; especially when it comes to relationships and sexual matters.

It's been a challenge to converse with you on this subject and I definitely appreciate it. If I could, I'd give you a delta just because you've managed to actually make me stop and (re)think plenty of times.\n\nSee, I think in this day and age, we are able to witness a lot of progress on many different issues and I'm sure this will get the limelight it deserves eventually. I agree that it should be put out there as an option and people should see it as a viable choice. \n\nAt the same time, I feel like we have to make an important distinction here that you might have been missing so far. There's a difference between, A) having an open relationship in the sense that person A and B are together and are allowed to either sleep with other people or engage in some group fun from time to time and B) A and/or B falling in love with other people while staying in their original relationship, thus incorporating this new person into their romantic world, if you will. \n\nI can totally understand situation A. I think many people have found themselves in it and - with proper communication and a good set of rules that works for everyone - it can be something that rejuvenates relationships and helps them flourish. \n\nSituation B is what we're discussing here and I think it's unfair to overlook just how much more complicated it is than the mono scenario. It's much more than sex; actual feelings are involved on multiple sides. You need to avoid individual parties' feelings getting hurt, everyone should be satisfied as much possible, no one should feel left out, everyone is important, there are certain rules that need to be followed, etc. It's just...complicated. And I think it's a valid argument against it. Not in a final sense (it's complicated thus it's wrong and stupid), but valid for people who don't practice it. \n\nEmotional involvement is something that shouldn't be ignored here. I've seen you draw parallels between romantic love and the love between members of family, friends, pets, etc. I disagree with putting those on remotely the same level. Romantic love trumps all other kinds of love simply by the sheer impact it has on your life. I'm currently in a long distance relationship, just to give you an example. In a few years, in order to overcome that distance, I will move *continents* to be with the person I love. I will leave everything behind: my family, friends, culture; you name it, I'm leaving it. For this one person that I love more than anything in this world (if it's not obvious at this point, lol). How could I do such a sacrifice for more than one person and maintain both relationships? I can't be in Canada and Australia at the same time. Then again, the point of every LDR is to lose the distance at one point (sooner better than later). I realize it's not your standard example of a mono relationship, but it is my reality. Even if I were the poly type, it would be impossible for me to pull this particular case off. \n\nAs for the ones I could (I could find this other person in the same city, for example), it's still not my thing. At all. \n\nYou also seem to have a wrong idea about mono relationships when it comes to attraction to others. It is widely accepted that we will all, at one point or another, be *attracted* to someone else. We will even acknowledge it (my gf and I often tell each other whom we find attractive and the like). What is not accepted is that that *attraction which is okay* will be taken to another level. And that's okay if both sides have agreed to it. \n\nMono relationships which you speak off fail because of a breach of trust (and the social contract that is a mono relationship). They don't fail because a person acted on their feelings of attraction towards another, but because that act was against the previously agreed upon rules. In relationships that have relaxed these rules, this would have been fine (though it still could have been a breach of trust if this person slept with another without informing their partner first, for example.) \n\nAnd this is just sex we're talking about. You're talking about fully fleshed out romantic relationships that go way beyond sex. Even if we just look at the time aspect of it all, most people can barely make time for one all-out relationship, not to mention several. You underestimate the complications that come with it because you're in it currently and have managed to make it work (something I will gladly congratulate you on.) \n\n&gt; I'm saying that, when the time comes when your partner feels something for another person, it would be healthier to be understanding of that; to be respectful and accommodating, and find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nYou're talking about emotions in a logical, non-emotional way, which is a big mistake. Most people out there can't control themselves the way you seem to. It's what we call being human, flawed and emotional. The things you accept at face value and see as something beautiful, I would see as a betrayal and it would hurt me immensely. There are situations (and plenty of them) in our lives where you can't come up with a solution that satisfies everyone. Not to mention that in the case of me falling for someone else, it wouldn't even occur to me to see turning my mono relationship into a poly one as a viable option. At all. Not because I don't know it's out there, but because I know it wouldn't work for me or my partner. It would need to be one or the other. \n\n&gt; Isn't this mostly out of fear?\n\nPartially, yes. You could also say it's possessiveness. I don't think either of these emotions are bad. Being afraid means you care about something, it means that losing it would impact you greatly. Possessiveness is more tricky because the line is easily crossed, but a certain amount of it is crucial in a healthy relationship, imo. My partner is possessive of me and I love it. It's within the healthy bounds so I feel completely free, but I also feel how much she wants me and wants me to be just hers and it makes me feel wanted and loved. It can be taken to the extreme and that's when it becomes bad, but I have nothing against a nice, healthy dose of it. Nothing at all. Not to mention that these feelings are mutual. We're both afraid of losing each other and messing it up so we work extra hard on our relationship and we're both possessive of the other to a certain point and we both definitely enjoy it. \n\n&gt; many people seem to me like children who were never taught how to share a toy.\n\nNot all toys are meant to be shared, though. What if it's an especially dear toy given to us by someone special. A toy that holds a special place in our heart and is so much more than a plastic car or a doll? Not to mention that I think it's a poor comparison. I treasure and value my partner and I don't play with her and share her the way I would a toy. On the contrary. \n\n&gt; But to a large extent, people experience drama and heartbreak because of someone's tendency to want to own their partner.\n\nBut both sides want it that way, in the vast majority of cases. How many times has it happened that one partner wanted to include their mistress into the marriage as a way of saving said marriage? I'd bet anything the percentage is very small. If I cheat on my gf and we break up, it's not just because she wouldn't accept this other person into our relationship; I wouldn't want that either. It wouldn't, at any point, seem like a viable option at all. So we would have two choices before us: stay together or break up. \n\n&gt; It's possible to have this sense of intimacy, loyalty, belonging, and trust, with more than a single person.\n\nAt different points in our lives? Certainly. At the same time? Impossible for me and many other people. Possible for you. It's easy for me to see that, why is it hard for you to see that other people don't find the idea of open relationships desirable or even possible? \n\n&gt; Even if you only have that with one person, it's possible to have that with that person; and for that person to still feel that way with someone else.\n\nTo be honest, this statement shocks me the most. I absolutely disagree. Because *that* is automatically made very different by the fact that it isn't exclusive to my partner and me, by the fact that it isn't something special just for the two of us. And before you accuse me of being selfish, love is selfish in the vast majority of cases. We love and we wish to be loved back. There's nothing wrong with that. My gf is the most important person in my life, the one person that knows me better that anyone, someone I share every part of myself with in every way imaginable. To do the same with another person, renders both relationships...well, not special for starters. But also not...I don't even know the right word honestly. I can only say it feels very and extremely wrong. And even a bit sad. Again, for myself personally; I am in no way judging the lives of other people.\n\nI apologize for the essay, btw.

I kept this on my mind, but didn't have the energy to follow up before now.\n\n&gt; If I could, I'd give you a delta just because you've managed to actually make me stop and (re)think plenty of times.\n\nThank you, I appreciate that. :-)\n\n&gt; There's a difference between, A) ... B) ...\n\nOK. I'll take this as A) casual non-monogamy vs. B) poly.\n\n&gt; It's just...complicated.\n\nBut I'm not saying that people ought to complicate their lives, and have more partners than they ought to.\n\nI'm just saying that it would be nice if everyone was better familiarized with the core idea, which is in fact very simple. The idea is:\n\nDo not try to own people.\n\nWhat this means is, define all your relationships, including that with your partner, in terms of how they relate to you, and how you relate to them. Do *not* define your relationships in terms of how they relate to other people.\n\nThis is already a principle that works for healthy parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, and friendships.\n\nSo take this principle, and apply it to romantic relationships. Do not complicate your life more than you want; do not seek out more sex or more partners than you want. Be with a single person your whole life; that's okay.\n\nJust do not try to own people. Allow them to make their own choices in how they relate to others. Do not define your relationship with them in terms of how they *should not* relate to other people.\n\n&gt; How could I do such a sacrifice for more than one person and maintain both relationships?\n\nWell... I intend to turn my business upside down, and move our family to the US - partly because I would like to live there; but I would not be doing so now if it wasn't that my wife wants to live there; and this is in large part because she's in love with a US person. It's still probably a good idea regardless, but - that's part of the reason.\n\nSo, my response to that would be - if you're in love with multiple people; and they're in love with you; perhaps they might be willing to adapt to you, too. I'm not saying it can always happen; often people can't, or won't.\n\nBut I don't see it as *that* much more unrealistic for three people to uproot themselves to live closer together, than for two people to do so. It just takes more coordination.\n\n&gt; Mono relationships which you speak off fail because of a breach of trust (and the social contract that is a mono relationship). They don't fail because a person acted on their feelings of attraction towards another, but because that act was against the previously agreed upon rules.\n\nTo me, a mono relationship preventing a new connection from being realized is a situation just as bad as when the new connection causes the mono relationship to break up. Both situations are minus one worthwhile thing that could be. Poly is the only situation where all such connections can coexist, and not be at odds with each other.\n\n&gt; most people can barely make time for one all-out relationship, not to mention several.\n\nBut I'm not saying people should seek out more partners than they are comfortable with - whether it's for sex or for love. I'm just saying people would be better off not defining relationships in terms of what their partner is *not* doing.\n\nIf you don't want a fling, but your partner does - what's wrong with that?\n\n&gt; I treasure and value my partner\n\nSee, that's the thing. She's her own person. Sure, it can be fun to be owned for a while, but I'm not sure it's such a healthy long-term idea for a person to take on the role of a valued artifact for someone to store in a treasure room.\n\nOK, so you do it to each other, and that makes it balanced. But suppose we lived forever. Do you think this would be a good situation to keep up forever? Or if not with one person, to keep repeating with different people for millions of years? Isn't it a way to cage yourself, to prevent yourself from changing?\n\nEven if you're staying in the treasure room voluntarily so as not to hurt the other person, does it not prevent you from experiencing and growing? Are you sure this is fine to do for millions of years?\n\nIf you think millions of years of this could be too much - then what makes 50 years the right amount? Or 30?\n\n&gt; Most people out there can't control themselves the way you seem to.\n\nIt's not about control, it's about acceptance. My argument is that this is only hard because no one teaches it. Everyone who wants to learn how to do it has to do it from scratch, and that means that currently, the only people who do it are those who are driven to poly.\n\nBut there's value in learning this acceptance, even for people who won't need to practice it. The people who are driven to poly are here to blaze the trail and show this to us.\n\nI'm arguing that acceptance of another person's freedom is the standard that should be taught. It would be much much easier for most people to do if they had examples and role models starting from childhood, showing this.\n\n&gt; If I cheat on my gf and we break up, it's not just because she wouldn't accept this other person into our relationship; I wouldn't want that either. It wouldn't, at any point, seem like a viable option at all. So we would have two choices before us: stay together or break up. \n\nThe way I see it, you're supporting my point. No one taught you acceptance, you never learned how to not think of your partner in binary terms (mine / not mine). If you grew up in a culture that taught this, you would know - not just rationally, but emotionally - that a new interest, however passionate, does not have to mean the end of an existing loving relationship. Your partner would also be secure in knowing that, and would not have to interfere.\n\nThis is not some superhuman ability or a biological trait. This is something we could all learn as children.\n\nAll I'm saying is that a culture that taught this would be preferable.

I kept this on my mind, but didn't have the energy to follow up before now.\n\n&gt; If I could, I'd give you a delta just because you've managed to actually make me stop and (re)think plenty of times.\n\nThank you, I appreciate that. :-)\n\n&gt; There's a difference between, A) ... B) ...\n\nOK. I'll take this as A) casual non-monogamy vs. B) poly.\n\n&gt; It's just...complicated.\n\nBut I'm not saying that people ought to complicate their lives, and have more partners than they ought to.\n\nI'm just saying that it would be nice if everyone was better familiarized with the core idea, which is in fact very simple. The idea is:\n\nDo not try to own people.\n\nWhat this means is, define all your relationships, including that with your partner, in terms of how they relate to you, and how you relate to them. Do *not* define your relationships in terms of how they relate to other people.\n\nThis is already a principle that works for healthy parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, and friendships.\n\nSo take this principle, and apply it to romantic relationships. Do not complicate your life more than you want; do not seek out more sex or more partners than you want. Be with a single person your whole life; that's okay.\n\nJust do not try to own people. Allow them to make their own choices in how they relate to others. Do not define your relationship with them in terms of how they *should not* relate to other people.\n\n&gt; How could I do such a sacrifice for more than one person and maintain both relationships?\n\nWell... I intend to turn my business upside down, and move our family to the US - partly because I would like to live there; but I would not be doing so now if it wasn't that my wife wants to live there; and this is in large part because she's in love with a US person. It's still probably a good idea regardless, but - that's part of the reason.\n\nSo, my response to that would be - if you're in love with multiple people; and they're in love with you; perhaps they might be willing to adapt to you, too. I'm not saying it can always happen; often people can't, or won't.\n\nBut I don't see it as *that* much more unrealistic for three people to uproot themselves to live closer together, than for two people to do so. It just takes more coordination.\n\n&gt; Mono relationships which you speak off fail because of a breach of trust (and the social contract that is a mono relationship). They don't fail because a person acted on their feelings of attraction towards another, but because that act was against the previously agreed upon rules.\n\nTo me, a mono relationship preventing a new connection from being realized is a situation just as bad as when the new connection causes the mono relationship to break up. Both situations are minus one worthwhile thing that could be. Poly is the only situation where all such connections can coexist, and not be at odds with each other.\n\n&gt; most people can barely make time for one all-out relationship, not to mention several.\n\nBut I'm not saying people should seek out more partners than they are comfortable with - whether it's for sex or for love. I'm just saying people would be better off not defining relationships in terms of what their partner is *not* doing.\n\nIf you don't want a fling, but your partner does - what's wrong with that?\n\n&gt; I treasure and value my partner\n\nSee, that's the thing.

Are we both slaves to each other, we mutually own each other?\n\nNot yet. :-)\n\nIt's not a problem while you're in this phase, but this phase doesn't necessarily last forever. For some people, it does. But for most people, sticking to this means propping the walls up with effort.\n\nRight now, neither of you have a desire to experience being with anyone else. But one or both of you might have that desire in 5 years, or 10 years, or 20. It may not mean that you want to end your relationship, either; you just may want to experience something else.\n\nIf this happens, you have several options, all of which are well-known. But the one people consider most noble, in this situation, is to manage your attraction to the other person, or your desire to try something else, and to just box yourself in.\n\nWhen *that* happens, then yes. You will have created a box for yourselves; and it will be difficult to get out of.\n\nI propose that you don't make a box. Enjoy while both of you want to be with each other exclusively. But don't expect this to last forever. Don't make the relationship conditional on this.\n\nOf course, our culture being what it is, I don't suggest that you have this conversation with your partner. She might very well not understand where you are coming from. But if our culture taught this, you could. Or rather - someone who *knows* that this might be a problem for them could have this conversation, and would be less likely to take the gamble that the situation will never arise.\n\n(As it is, with cultural prejudice against it, many people take this gamble, and lose.)\n\n&gt; These are all important relationships in their own right, but you cannot seriously tell me that your relationship with your parents is comparable to your relationship with your wife, beyond the fact that they are both relationships in your life. \n\nNot now, of course not. But when I was e.g. 0 - 3 years old, my relationship with my mother was a lot more intimate than it is now. My relationships with my parents are not as close now; but for many people, they remain close and intimate throughout their lives.\n\n&gt; If your wife woke up tomorrow and went on a murderous rampage, would you support and stay with her? After all, it has nothing to do with you, she killed 10 other random people. An extreme example, yes. \n\nBut in this case I wouldn't be running away because of her murderous interactions with other people. I'd be running away because I would be fearing for my *own* life; because of what these actions tell me she is capable of.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in the US are married to spouses who have legally killed a number of other people who may or may not have deserved it. Think army wives, or husbands whose wives are drone pilots.\n\nConversely, I can imagine leaving someone for much less if their interactions with other people tell me something about them that convinces me I better run. For example - if a partner were to behave nice to me, but then I caught her expertly pulling social strings, and manipulating like a sociopath in order to exact harsh vengeance on another person for something petty - if I saw that, I would conclude my partner is a vengeful sociopath, and I better run.\n\nBut if my partner loves another person, that doesn't tell me anything bad about her. If anything, seeing her be as loving and loyal to another person as she is to me, without harming either one of us, would make me esteem her more highly.\n\n&gt; It's a difference in wants and preferences, and a big one at that.\n\nBut this partner wants to do everything with you that you want to do with her. You've known her long enough to trust her word and commitment. She just wants to experience this fling in her private time. The time when you're engaged with a hobby, or going out with friends, for instance, she might want to spend with this guy. The time when she'd otherwise be alone.\n\nThis is not a difference in wants and preferences *within* your relationship. Her wants and preferences *within* the relationship are aligned with yours. The issue is that your preferences go *beyond* what she does with you, and how much she's available to you.\n\nThe reasons you have these preferences boil down to fears. In our culture, these fears seem justified. But maybe they don't have to be.\n\n&gt; I would like to just point out that you've been doing this throughout our discussion. Little condescending comments like this one,\n\nI worry a fair bit about coming across as condescending. However, I need you to understand that the whole *reason* I posted this CMV is because I haven't been able to lose the idea that the attitudes of openness are superior *at least* to the extent that they ought to be taught.\n\nIn other words, what you are bothered by is not something ancillary; it is the very substance of what I wanted to discuss. I do try to express myself in a respectful manner, and I do apologize if I fail. However, the fact is that this belief of mine is there. You find it offensive, as I understand people do. But if I could just dismiss it, I wouldn't need this CMV. And if I hide it, then the CMV is not doing its job.\n\n&gt; I could go and say that you don't value your partner enough or that she doesn't really mean all that much to you if you can share her the way you do, yet I don't.\n\nIf you think that, maybe you should do that? It is uncomfortable, but that's where truth usually lies. Do you believe that? Would you like me to address it as an argument?\n\n&gt; I don't think we should go from saying you'll burn in hell if you're gay to you'll burn in hell if you're straight. \n\nAgreed. :-)\n\n&gt; I think both [mono and open] can be taught as viable options, both having their own set of risks and benefits and then we let the people choose what's best for them.\n\nThat would definitely be an advance over the current situation. It would be way, way better than poly being considered abnormal.\n\nI just... worry it doesn't do enough.\n\nMy main concern is that mono is a mutual lock that young naive people are prone to get into, and then find it hard to extract themselves out of. Mono is deceptively attractive because it:\n\n* Aligns with childlike idealism. (Just us! In love! Always! Forever!)\n\n* Provides instant gratification. (Promise the Moon! Have relationship now!)\n\n* Defers the work. (Worry about unmet desires, healthy parameters, insecurities later)\n\n* Is long-term costly. (Make promises now, box yourself in for life - or until break-up.)\n\nIn other words - mono seems to me like a payday loan, or rolling over credit card debt. It's tempting to do and easy to get rolling. The promises feel trivial to make, and seem worth it at the moment.\n\nTo mono people, it seems as though poly is about eating your cake and having it, too. But it really isn't:\n\n* It's realistic. (Our love is great, but keep in mind we might at some point want to love other people!)\n\n* Provides delayed gratification. (Do not make promises to enter a relationship until you find one with parameters you think will work in the long term.)\n\n* Requires work upfront. (Keep long-term desires in mind when making promises. Work through insecurities. Communicate about difficult potential issues a lot, and at length)\n\n* Is long-term rewarding. (Investments you make into openness today, will pay off dividends always.)\n\nI'm worried that, if we don't put *emphasis* on poly when we teach it, people will still be attracted to what is easier in the short run, even if it ends up costing them opportunities and happiness in the long haul.\n\n*God* yes, at the very least, it needs to be considered at least an equally valid *option*. It's just that... I really can't help but see this as a debate about whether we should teach evolution only, or evolution and creationism as equals. \"Choose one, both are equally right!\" With the status quo being, of course, that evolution is not taught, at all..."}, {"id": "cn87zm9", "body": "&gt; Why then, do you question the majority of people on this planet when they tell you they're happy?\n\nI suppose this could be sampling bias, but I'm not sure that it is.\n\nMy exposure to people's monogamous relationships is mostly when they come online and ask for help, or share information about their current and past relationships.\n\nIn most cases, it seems to me that these relationships run along fine, for as long as they happen to avoid an obstacle that would involve someone's interest in another person. Most open relationships would either survive this, or if they end, they would end gracefully. But most monogamous relationships seem to blow up.\n\nWhen people have desires they know their partner won't understand, they either repress the desire (which is bad, they're now suffering), or try to have their cake and eat it too (by cheating - and thereby, debasing the relationship, and hurting their partner as well as themselves in the process).\n\nIn open relationships, these issues either don't exist, or are handled much more gracefully.\n\nThat *is* what differentiates an open relationship. It's not about what goes on when everything is fine. An open relationship can look exactly like a monogamous one 99% of the time. Yet it is radically different in how things will be handled that 1% of the time. One is likely to blow up. The other is likely to continue.\n\n&gt; Would it be fair for me to say all open relationships are doomed, unnatural, or that people in those relationships end up unhappy, just because some people do?\n\nThis is actually a common argument in poly circles. When poly people's relationships end, their mono friends often think, \"well, that was obviously because poly\". But then these same folk look at the nation's 50% divorce rate, and they don't say, \"well, that's obviously because mono\".\n\nBut I feel justified in suspecting just that, because when I read most of these stories of mono people breaking up, when they explain the details, in most cases I see two people who loved each other breaking up *because* they entered the relationship with mono expectations, and couldn't handle the reality being different. What I see is love wasted for no reason, people suffering and going through ugly breakups for no reason; only to enter new relationships with the same unrealistic expectations, bound to be broken again and again.\n\nSo I am inclined to say that the 50% divorce rate is because mono. Or at the very least, that the ratio of acrimonious divorces vs. friendly ones would be much improved if people approached their relationships as potentially poly. Not necessarily actually poly, but *potentially* poly; at least open to trying to understand the partner's feelings for someone else if they happen.\n\n&gt;  I know that seems drastic to you, but we couldn't function in an open relationship.\n\nBut, but, but... What does an open relationship not give you? :("}, {"id": "cn88eqz", "body": "To quickly jump in if I may-\n\nIf I'm in a monogamous relationship and I see an attractive person (and let's assume they're into me), I have a choice.  I can choose to act on it, knowing that I am risking the near-certain end of my monogamous relationship and loss of my partner, or I can make a conscious/logical/evolved decision that I care more about my partner than the person I see, and I am choosing my partner over the person in front of me.\n\nI don't think of this as repressing a desire.  As a relatively evolved creature, I can acknowledge and even embrace my attraction without acting on it.  In a healthy relationship, each person will understand that their partner will sometimes be attracted to other people, and that's totally normal!  Nobody said being in a relationship means you have to go blind.  But it does mean you are *expected* to choose the partner and the relationship over the person you see.\n\nThere's a sexual advantage to that too- STDs (or lack thereof).  In a monogamous relationship you can both get tested, start some birth control scheme and then go nuts without having to worry about fluid contact.  That can improve pleasure for both partners.  In an open relationship, unprotected sex is much more risky unless you are both getting constantly tested like porn stars.\n\nFinally- the problem with cheating isn't cheating, it's the broken trust.  In a monogamous relationship you trust that the person will stay faithful.  In ANY relationship you trust that the person will do a lot of things.  \n\nSo let me ask-- your wife has a boyfriend, presumably at some point or another they have sex, right?  What if (for example) she intentionally stopped her birth control and got pregnant with the BF, and wanted to keep the kid?  Would this count as broken trust?  What if your kid was older and she wanted to move in with the boyfriend for a while to raise the kid?  Would that be broken trust?  What if she wanted to change the situation so she is married to the kid's father and now YOU are the boyfriend?  Would that be broken trust?  Now I'm assuming that somewhere in this you'd have a problem, maybe you wouldn't and it's all good; if so I'm sure there's some boundary somewhere she could cross that would break trust.  \nMy point is- I don't think you and I are so different- I suspect that broken trust would hurt you as much as it would me.

I can choose to act on it, knowing that I am risking the near-certain end of my monogamous relationship and loss of my partner, or I can make a conscious/logical/evolved decision that I care more about my partner than the person I see, and I am choosing my partner over the person in front of me.\n\nI don't think of this as repressing a desire.  As a relatively evolved creature, I can acknowledge and even embrace my attraction without acting on it.  In a healthy relationship, each person will understand that their partner will sometimes be attracted to other people, and that's totally normal!  Nobody said being in a relationship means you have to go blind.  But it does mean you are *expected* to choose the partner and the relationship over the person you see.\n\nThere's a sexual advantage to that too- STDs (or lack thereof).  In a monogamous relationship you can both get tested, start some birth control scheme and then go nuts without having to worry about fluid contact.  That can improve pleasure for both partners.  In an open relationship, unprotected sex is much more risky unless you are both getting constantly tested like porn stars.\n\nFinally- the problem with cheating isn't cheating, it's the broken trust.

And if they bottle it, then the others in the family are essentially torturing that person unknowingly.\n\nEven if we were talking about mono, it is preferable to endure the challenges and heartbreak if that's what it takes for everyone involved to find a situation in which they're happy.

If you're in a situation where one partner doesn't feel fulfilled unless they substantially change it, you're not going to have a happy time preventing that change by saying \"if only\".\n\n&gt; your lack of answer suggests you either haven't thought it through or don't consider such a scenario likely enough to warrant thinking through. \n\nI have thought it through sufficiently that I know I can deal with it fine if it happened. It doesn't mean I want to dwell on it for the purpose of this conversation.\n\n&gt; If two people have a kid together, and they are married, they have an obligation to each other and to the kid to try as hard as possible to stay primary with each other. \n\nI would generally agree, but not \"as hard as possible\". There's such a thing as trying to stay together too hard."}, {"id": "cn9z34h", "body": "FWIW, I'm glad you responded to that as it was the most important part.  And my responses to your reply to my comment are coming, much like yourself I want to take time to go through it...\n\n&gt; Surely, much of what you discuss would not be what I prefer.\n\n*Not what you would prefer?*  My friend, you must have an extra gland in your brain that secretes pure THC into your bloodstream.  What you call 'not what you would prefer' is my attempts to describe some of the most painful abandonment scenarios possible by a partner.  Now I must admit I have the flu right now and my writing is not the best, but jeez, 'not what you would prefer'?  That was NOT what I was expecting.\n\nThat said, I will give you a delta (edit:  NM, I tried) for making me think a bit.  I suppose I can see how simply not setting any expectations at all makes it very difficult to get hurt by the changing or fleeting desires of a partner.  I mean, it's definitely not for me, but I suppose I can at least understand the appeal of it now.\n\n------\n\nI do want to understand one thing better though- how and in what ways kids (and the parental responsibility to them) fit into your ultra-chilled-out view of the world?  When one parent 'leaves the nest' that necessarily increases the workload on the remaining parent, unless the kid is at or near adult-level maturity, not to mention the issue of financial responsibility to a kid (to pay for both primary schooling and ideally also college).\n\nSo let's say you and your wife have a kid, and she wants to abandon your family and start a new family with her boyfriend.  What details of this scenario make this okay or not okay for you?  IE, is it okay if the kid is above a certain age, but not okay before that?  Is it okay if she still contributes financially?  Is it okay if she takes the kid half the time?

If having a child with him was her strong preference, it is her right to want this. I would attempt to adjust as constructively as possible around this.\n\n&gt; Would this count as broken trust?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt;  What if your kid was older and she wanted to move in with the boyfriend for a while to raise the kid?\n\nIf she chooses to do so, what right do I have to insist on always being \"primary\"? She's her own person, she's not mine to own. I will be in her life to the extent that she wants me. If this means becoming \"secondary\", then that's how it must be. Why would I force myself on her, if she wants to spend more time with him?\n\nIf that creates a gap in my life, I am free to seek other people and experiences to fill this gap. Just like I don't own her, she also does not own me. We can let our relationship become less close, she can move in with him, and yet we can still meet, and talk, and still occasionally have sex. If it works, and we enjoy it, we don't have to end it.\n\n&gt; What if she wanted to change the situation so she is married to the kid's father and now YOU are the boyfriend?

For example - if she comes at me at night, and tries to stab me with a knife, that would make me take a second look at the relationship. If she accuses me of rape when I didn't, and lies and tries to put me in prison, that would make me reconsider the relationship. If she starts abusing me, emotionally or physically, that would make me reconsider the relationship.\n\nBut notice - these are all things that are between me and her. They are about the quality of our relationship. I would not consider it a betrayal if she merely wants to also have a relationship with someone else; or if she wants to make that relationship more important. That could make me feel sad, but not betrayed. It would require my adjustment, not punishment.\n\n&gt; We just place that boundary in different places...\n\nWell, yeah - but in the sense that you place that boundary in a place that should be of no concern.

But it's temporary, and you don't have to leave your partner over this.\n\nThis essentially happened to me. I was beginning to show signs of depression, which I now believe was due to a vitamin D-3 deficiency. Everything started to look a bit pointless and grey; I was no longer getting the pleasure that I used to get out of things that I previously enjoyed. It began to seem pointless to engage in constructive activity, and I had to push myself into it.\n\nThen I met a person, on reddit, with whom I felt incredible chemistry. I connected with her on a level that bypassed my depression. I cannot explain any reasons for this chemistry. I can't even be sure we're that compatible. I've met other people who are like her in different ways, but it's just... the feeling is not there. This later caused me to look into reincarnation, soulmates, and the spiritual world. It started me on a journey that substantially changed me.\n\nI lost this person, because, well... I knew I would lose her. There was no way for this to happen much differently.\n\nDuring this time, my ability to feel love for my wife was decreased. I rationally wanted to feel for her every ounce of what I felt for this other person. She is *worthy* of love; she is the center of my life; and even though it hurt her, she stood by me. But I just couldn't more than just *want* to feel it. I continued to be depressed, saw no point in life, and basically just kept going out of rationality.\n\nThis finally ended when I figured out I was vitamin D-3 deficient. I took actions to fix that; and with this, my ability to feel love and joy has returned. I now again feel for my wife what I *wanted* to feel when depressed. I now again have the drive to *do* things, and I am no longer just *pushing* myself to it.\n\nThere are multiple lessons in this.\n\n* Would I have preferred to have been monogamous, to avoid this happening? No, fuck no. It was an enriching experience that fundamentally changed me. I always had a vision of how I wanted to be, but no idea of how to get there. This experience was the bridge, and we had to be poly for it.\n\n* Would it have been a good idea to leave my wife, to be monogamous with this other person? No, fuck no. I never even wanted this. I wanted a sustainable situation that would allow for both relationships. I expected to be able to feel as much love for my wife again, and I was right about this.\n\n* Would it have been better for my wife if this didn't happen? A mono person would say yes. But if I hadn't gone through this, I wouldn't have changed. Would it have been better for her to live with a person increasingly bitter and cynical? I would also have a very diminished understanding for the depth of her feelings for the other man she loves. I would create obstacles for that relationship, and/or not be able to support her in it.\n\n* Now that this is done, does that mean that poly is no longer of use for me?\n\nI've always felt the other person is out there. This inexplicable feeling was a guiding light for me in our exploration of swinging and poly. But then, I met her. And now she's gone, and with her, so is the inexplicable guiding feeling. I've found the main thing that I needed to find in poly; and with her gone... yes. I do have to say poly is no longer of the same value for me.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there's no value. I still enjoy relating to people in an intimate way. It still enriches my life. It still adds to our relationship, and doesn't subtract from it. Our sexual fantasies remain as wild as they were, and have not gone away.\n\nI can understand, at this point, why people would choose to be monogamous, and not feel like they're missing out on some major thing. I don't feel that people should seek out sex, or additional relationships.\n\nHowever, I do think it would be nice if this just wasn't an issue at all. If everyone could just be open to life - live mono, or however we want; just not be so concerned about shoehorning things."}, {"id": "cn87zm9", "body": "&gt; Why then, do you question the majority of people on this planet when they tell you they're happy?\n\nI suppose this could be sampling bias, but I'm not sure that it is.\n\nMy exposure to people's monogamous relationships is mostly when they come online and ask for help, or share information about their current and past relationships.\n\nIn most cases, it seems to me that these relationships run along fine, for as long as they happen to avoid an obstacle that would involve someone's interest in another person.

What I see is love wasted for no reason, people suffering and going through ugly breakups for no reason; only to enter new relationships with the same unrealistic expectations, bound to be broken again and again.\n\nSo I am inclined to say that the 50% divorce rate is because mono.

Most open relationships would either survive this, or if they end, they would end gracefully. But most monogamous relationships seem to blow up.\n\nWhen people have desires they know their partner won't understand, they either repress the desire (which is bad, they're now suffering), or try to have their cake and eat it too (by cheating - and thereby, debasing the relationship, and hurting their partner as well as themselves in the process).\n\nIn open relationships, these issues either don't exist, or are handled much more gracefully.\n\nThat *is* what differentiates an open relationship. It's not about what goes on when everything is fine. An open relationship can look exactly like a monogamous one 99% of the time. Yet it is radically different in how things will be handled that 1% of the time. One is likely to blow up. The other is likely to continue.\n\n&gt; Would it be fair for me to say all open relationships are doomed, unnatural, or that people in those relationships end up unhappy, just because some people do?\n\nThis is actually a common argument in poly circles. When poly people's relationships end, their mono friends often think, \"well, that was obviously because poly\". But then these same folk look at the nation's 50% divorce rate, and they don't say, \"well, that's obviously because mono\".\n\nBut I feel justified in suspecting just that, because when I read most of these stories of mono people breaking up, when they explain the details, in most cases I see two people who loved each other breaking up *because* they entered the relationship with mono expectations, and couldn't handle the reality being different. What I see is love wasted for no reason, people suffering and going through ugly breakups for no reason; only to enter new relationships with the same unrealistic expectations, bound to be broken again and again.\n\nSo I am inclined to say that the 50% divorce rate is because mono. Or at the very least, that the ratio of acrimonious divorces vs. friendly ones would be much improved if people approached their relationships as potentially poly. Not necessarily actually poly, but *potentially* poly; at least open to trying to understand the partner's feelings for someone else if they happen.\n\n&gt;  I know that seems drastic to you, but we couldn't function in an open relationship.\n\nBut, but, but...

You're forcing yourself to react inappropriately because that's what's required by the rules.\n\nYour best bet is to tailor your response to each situation, and to discard the pretense that the whole thing rests on formal rules.\n\nIf your relationships rested on rules, they would have their own private legal system.

And we go through much hardship because of that. Monogamy is about promising each other the impossible; crushing ourselves with guilt when we can't give it; and when we don't get it, feeling angry and bitter and betrayed.\n\nThe relationship type we should all aspire to is love without chains. Anything less than that is less worthwhile. Anything less than that is debased and perverse. It should be possible for people to enter monogamous, exclusive relationships, if that's what they like, but it should not be the default.

I can say \"I love my new laptop!\" but that doesn't mean the same thing as \"I love my sister!\" and that doesn't mean the same thing as \"I love you\".\n\nI can see the difference between \"I love my laptop\" and \"I love this person\". One is love; the other is excitement.\n\nBut I'm not sure I see much difference between \"I love you\" and \"I love my sister\". Aren't both love for a person?\n\nI think there are some people with whom a person connects more strongly than with others, but this person is not always one's partner. For some, it's their best friend; for others, their grandparent; still others, their child; still others, a sister or brother.\n\nSo yes, I agree that we have people with whom we bond more easily, and feel a more passionate love, than with others. But I think this can be a trap if this person is our romantic partner. It can lead us to believe that we should be exclusive with this person, and that it's wrong to feel love of a similar kind for others.\n\nPeople do not feel this way when the person they most deeply connect to is their best friend (to whom they aren't sexually attracted), or their mother, or their brother.\n\nYou can see people saying things like \"bros before hoes\" - these are people whose deepest connection is to their best friend, not their lover. I've seen a number of AMAs from people who are in romantic and sexual relationship with their brother or sister; these are people whose deepest connection is with their sibling, and they indulge it like they would with a lover. It stands to reason that many more people than that have a connection of the same depth with a sibling, but without sexual attraction, and end up having each their own separate lovers. These are people who talk about the special value of love between siblings - something which may not *exist* for others who may also have siblings, but don't connect with them this way. \n\nMy point is - many people don't feel their deepest connection with their romantic partner; yet they still find and love a romantic partner, even as they retain a relationship with the other highly important person in their life. Their deepest connection is not exclusive.\n\nIs it not a mistake that people who find their deepest connection with their romantic partner treat this as a sign that it must be exclusive?\n\n&gt; Today though, society is very accepting of long term unmarried partners living together. \n\nBut isn't that hiding what would otherwise be divorces? When an unmarried cohabiting couple of 10 years splits - perhaps because one of them temporarily did not meet the requirements of monogamy - isn't that effectively what we'd call a divorce if they were married? They're not somehow less of a couple just because they're not married.\n\n&gt; Monogamy isn't about denying, it's about giving.\n\nGiving is only giving when it's free; when you aren't expecting something in return. In this sense, monogamy is, at best, trading. And at that, it is trading of something quite grim: both partners promise *not to love* other people. It isn't a gift of love; it is *trading of non-love*! Don't you find that perverse?\n\n&gt; you want to give 100% of yourself to them\n\nBut people don't do that. And if they do, it is wrong. There are always other people who matter. Our parents, our brothers, our sisters, our children. Other people are important!\n\n&gt; That's probably an evolutionary trait,\n\nI definitely agree that what drives monogamy are evolutionary traits, but that doesn't mean that they're good. Evolution also drives obesity. We evolved to be driven to eat and store calories, and we continue to do so after our environment has changed. For many people - including myself - it takes significant daily effort to maintain a healthy shape.\n\nWhy would we assume that inherited evolutionary traits are all good when it comes to relationships?\n\n&gt; with STDs flying around, staying faithful to your partner can keep everybody safer\n\nI think this concern is greatly exaggerated by people whose real issue with non-monogamy is something else. Crowded workplaces also spread the flu, yet we don't use this to shame people who work in crowded areas. We have medicine and condoms which effectively counter STDs with major health impact. Meanwhile, the public greatly exaggerates the impact of STDs which this doesn't effectively counter.\n\nPeople use STDs to shame the non-monogamous because they're uncomfortable with non-monogamy for another reason. If that wasn't the case, STDs would be grounds for compassion, not shaming.\n\n&gt; If you find it 'impossible' to not be intimate with people that're not your partner,\n\nI think everyone can say \"no\" when it comes down to a decision. We can feel love and attraction for someone, and not act on it. But the thoughts are there!\n\nWhen I say that monogamy is about promising the impossible, it's to the extent that we promise not just to never *act* on our feelings for other people, but to not *have* them in the first place. I think this is something no one can promise.\n\n&gt; The point is though that most people don't find it hard to be monogamous.\n\nUntil you meet the right other person.\n\nThen you have to break someone's heart. Monogamy sets you up for it. If you were open, you wouldn't have to break anything.\n\n&gt; Maybe that's why you feel it's 'dark', because it's something that's very hard for you?\n\nNo. It's because love is good, love is light; but monogamy, instead of being a gift of love, is in fact trading of non-love for others.\n\nI think it's grim to have relationships whose critical component is non-love. We should care about what we give and get from our partners; not about what our partner *doesn't* give to others.\n\n&gt; Nobody's holding jealousy up on a platter.\n\nDon't talk so bravely in absolutes. Many people are. They might be young and inexperienced - I can suspect that, but I cannot confirm it based on what people write. However, an argument I've heard a number of times is \"If you aren't jealous, it's proof you don't love someone.\"\n\n&gt; enough to make me question if you've ever been in a healthy monogamous relationship?\n\nThat's kind of a loaded question, given that I'm arguing the premise that monogamy is intrinsically unhealthy. :-) I think we would need to elaborate on what you think is healthy, and if we did that, we would find that your definition of healthy might be closer to the open end of the spectrum, than the closed one. That doesn't mean the closed end of the spectrum doesn't exist, however - and that there aren't people who believe that is the optimum!\n\n&gt; And only the craziest fundies would complain about acknowledging attraction to another person (who's not your partner).\n\nWhat you seem to be implying is that, in a relationship you would consider healthy, partners can acknowledge their attraction to others. I think this is definitely towards the open end of the spectrum. I don't get the impression that, in a majority of closed monogamous relationships, it is wise or acceptable to do that.\n\n&gt; But don't think lust is based in love, because it's not. Lust is physical attraction, nothing more.\n\nFor me, lust is definitely an expression of love. I can understand how, for others, it is not. For example, there's rough pornography that depicts downright abuse and humiliation of people as sexual objects. I find that disgusting; yet, I understand that others are turned on.\n\nFor me, lust involves at least a degree of love for, caring for, and connection with the whole person. The stronger the connection, the freer the lust. At the very least, I need to feel respect and caring for the person I'm having sex with. Anything less would feel wrong and dirty. Not dirty in a playful and naughty way, but dirty in a serious and evil way - in the sense, \"Get me out of here as soon as possible.\"\n\n&gt; for the record that's where there are multiple partners who all love each other,\n\nNo no no no no. There are many forms of polyamory. What you're talking about sounds like a group relationship, probably the least frequent and likely. The most likely and frequent form of polyamory is a V, where one person has two partners who don't interact much. That's a form of poly, as long as everyone in the V knows and agrees.\n\n&gt; you feel staying faithful to a partner is near-impossible\n\nNo! Staying faithful to a partner is both possible and valuable. What I'm arguing is that it's perverse to define \"faithful\" to include a negative criterion about behavior towards others. \"Faithful\" should be properly defined in terms of how your partner acts towards *you*; not in terms of what they don't feel or do with other people."}, {"id": "2qp3ud", "body": "I would be surprised if someone were to argue that love of a parent for their child must be exclusive - and therefore, that a parent can only *really* love *one* child.\n\nI would be surprised if someone were to argue that love between siblings must be exclusive - anyone who has multiple siblings *must* choose a favorite one, and that's the only one they can love.\n\nI would be surprised if someone were to argue that these kinds of love are not love.\n\nAnd yet - we find ourselves in a society which fetishizes exclusivity in romance, even as we're bombarded with evidence that this doesn't work.

Jealousy is a sick and twisted emotion, based in possessiveness, insecurity, and fear. It's perverse that we take this for granted, even uphold it as a moral high ground.

People should be free to choose as they please and both options should be equally valid.\n\nI agree. However, I think that as long as there are the monogamous who judge non-monogamy, there need to be the non-monogamous who judge monogamy. If there isn't this balance, then people are not free to choose, because peer pressure only blows one way."}, {"id": "cn9ylir", "body": "&gt; I would find it peculiar if your logistical relationship capacity happened to equal exactly one point zero - not a fraction more, and not a fraction less - at all times and moments in your life. \n\nI considered this and I would not be able to pinpoint the exact number I am at or say it is 1.0 but I definitively feel like I do not have enough time or energy for a second relationship. I already do not have enough time and energy as it is. If I had more time, there are other categories I would like to allote more time to before adding a new partner. \n\nI obviously can not speak for my entire life but in the near future, I will be adding other time consuming things (hobbies, a dog, kids) so I don't really see any spot freeing up for a new partner anytime soon.\n\nI think you touch onto something when you say I can be a homebody with a single partner. I am definitively a homebody; I would not like to go out more for a new partner and I would also not like for a new partner to share my home which doesn't leave much space for one.\n\nYou are correct that I am not interested in anyone else; it's quite possible that if I was, I would make the time for it. It's kind-of a cost-benefit analysis; I don't see much benefit right now so I am not willing to pay the cost.\n\n&gt; Maintaining relationships with multiple people will expose you to conflicting demands, no matter the relationship type. They could be friends, or relatives, or romantic partners, or online gaming buddies.\n\nI find that the type of romantic relationships I want requires a lot more to maintain than my other relationships. \n\nI don't really get the cutting myself off that possibility forever bit. If my feelings on the subject changed, I could always reassess. It's not like I got \"monogamous forever\" tattooed on my arm in a world without laser removal.\n\n&gt; We think it's easier and cheaper to not build relationships for that... until they collapse around us.\n\nThat is an interesting thought. I will be honest, my reaction is definitively \"Meh, sounds like a lot of work for something that I don't even know will happen. We can always try to deal with it if it does.\" but I see your point. \n\nI will think about it more but right now, if I look at the cost-advantages, it doesn't seem worth it. We deal with issues when we are facing real life situations, not hypotheticals with many unknown variables. I would also point out that a car accident without a seatbelt or a building collapse can kill me, a relationship ending because of feelings we were not prepared for won't. \n\n&gt;  I don't think most serially monogamous relationships end because they've run their natural course. I think they end because we brutally terminate them, and we do so because we think we must.\n\nI have seen a lot of relationships end without a third person being involved. I do agree that there are also a lot that end when a third person is involved though it's hard to tell whether non-monogamy could have saved the relationship.\n\n&gt; However, I think that as long as there are the monogamous who judge non-monogamy, there need to be the non-monogamous who judge monogamy. If there isn't this balance, then people are not free to choose, because peer pressure only blows one way.\n\nI don't think it works that way. I don't think that as long as sexism and misogyny exists, we will need man-haters feminists (we will just need feminists) or that as long as some people hate blacks, we will need other people to hate muslims (we will need people who preach tolerance and fight intolerants)... \n\nI don't think that creates a balance that facilitate people's free choice. I think it just creates more division in that if you attack people (or their way of life), they immediately get defensive and shut you out. I have seen people become more open to the idea of non-monogamy relationships by talking with open-minded people than by judgmental people.

As a reaction, in the US there is a backlash movement that encourages people to love themselves. This is all well and good but this has come to translate into a mindset that \"*fuck the haters, my body is beautiful and i will not change it to fit your stereotypes!*\" resulting in an almost dangerous encouragement of being overweight. I believe that this will perpetuate obesity in the States and only lead to a more unhealthy population.\n\nI actually had a conversation with my parents about this over the holidays; they grew up in a much skinnier time period and they have noticed how a lot of pro-body movements praise larger body types and 'skinny-shame' smaller girls or even bashes men/women who aren't attracted to larger 'real' body types. My mother, who is a long-time nurse, actively hates the 'probody' movements and says they will be the slow death of America and it's children if they go on in the same mind set.\n\nOn the flip side, I do know that it is also true that mental issues/depression are an extremely large factor into weight gain and trying to make life less hostile for larger people helps rather than hinders a healthier lifestyle (versus shaming someone into being smaller or whatever). \n\nIt's a weird 21st century issue and I'm not sure how to deal with it. My parents raised me to not judge others and be accepting of everyone, but it truly seems as if some force is glorifying people for having 'real bodies' that 'might still be healthy' despite being what doctors identify as morbidly obese. As someone who has seen how healthy other countries live, seemingly without diet plans and hours spent at the gym, it is hard for me to not hate what the movement has come to stand for.\n\n**TL:DR   The movement for accepting 'fat' people in America is only glorifying being unhealthy and shames those that don't have a more 'natural' body type or don't find these body types attractive.**\n\n**EDIT** my original post didn't really say what my view/issue was, hopefully it's clarified now!\n\n[HERE IS THE BLOG THAT SPURRED MY CONTEMPLATION](http://thoughtcatalog.com/carolyn-hall/2014/04/6-things-i-dont-understand-about-the-fat-acceptance-movement/)"}, {"id": "cn82tum", "body": "I don't know if it is okay to give a 'deflection' in this sub rather than an actual rebuttal, but I will offer the following unless someone opposes:\n\nThe 'fat acceptance movement' is not really a popular thing; nobody outside of obscure corners of the internet takes it seriously.

On the other end, you have the crazy SJW types who think their doctors are fat shaming when the doctor expresses concern that their weight will cause health issues. \n\nThe crazy, radical side of things is not and never will be mainstream. Just look at feminism. We're, what, 40-50 years past the beginning of 2nd Wave feminism and *Beyonce* is a feminist icon, not the man hating lesbian who lives on a lesbian commune. It will never be accepted in the mainstream that morbid obesity can be caused by genetics alone. It'll never be accepted in the mainstream that a doctor is prejudice or hostile because he suggests seeing a nutritionist or starting an exercise routine. The concept of \"thin privilege\" will never be mainstream. \n\nWhat will end up on the mainstream end of things is that it's OK not to hate yourself or your body because you're overweight.

People might think you're an asshole, but you won't face the kind of social retribution that comes with mocking and bullying a gay or black person today.\n\nIt's also important to realize that the entire fat acceptance movement mostly involves young people, at least in my observations.

The ones that go out to all you can eat buffets and don't exercise while using their kids as an excuse? They normalized it a while ago. We don't even blink when we see fat people use the mobility scooter things at Walmart that are meant for handicap people.\n\n**TL;DR:** The fat acceptance movement ranges from the moderate and benign to the radical and harmful. It's unlikely the harmful elements of the radical side will make it into the mainstream. It's more likely that you see \"you're beautiful; love yourself\" type messages come out of the movement, which is probably an important thing to hear for the young demographic that fat acceptance largely appeals to. And there's no reason to fear that the movement will cause the normalization of obesity in society, because that's already happened.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify/be more concise, the populist side of the fat acceptance movement is almost entirely about body image and anti-bullying, from my observations. Any message more politicized than that tends to come from the more radicalized side of the movement, whether that's anger towards thin people (via the concept of thin privilege or via intentional thin shaming), anti-health/anti-doctor rhetoric and pseudo science, or something else.\n\n\"Middle America\" fat people are a much bigger problem when it comes to American obesity, however.

They aren't taking corrective measures, they aren't concerned about future health problems, they aren't even really making excuses for themselves. They see it as normal.

Even it's more palatable, moderate side, anarcho-capitalism, is still rather extreme. It still calls for the dissolution of government, holds property rights and liberty above all else, etc. An-caps just believe there's a place for a market economy within anarchism. But then if you considered anarchy as a smaller part of the much larger libertarian ideology, you see similar but watered down ideas. Libertarians want to reduce the size of the government, they put strong faith in market economies, and they highly value property rights. I would never consider mainstream libertarianism to be as radical as anarcho-capitalism, however. \n\nI also disagree that radicalism is defined as ahead of the times. Radicalism is defined by being outside societal norms. Radical Islam, for instance, isn't ahead of the times, it's stuck centuries ago. And, to return to a previous example, radical feminism never took hold, unless you consider suffrage, equal pay, or access to contraceptive to be radical. \n\nSimilarly, I don't think we'll ever see the radical side of fat acceptance go mainstream. It's too outside societal norms. It's easy to swallow the ides that we shouldn't mistreat fat people or that it's okay for fat people not to hate themselves, but it's much more difficult to swallow that your doctor is wrong and hostile when he tells you your weight is a health risk (a common sentiment seen on FA tumblrs like thisisthinprivilege). That goes against what we've been taught since a young age, that doctors are highly trained and knowledgeable, and that their primary concern is your health and wellbeing.

Willpower is a limited resource after all.\n\n3 years ago I lost 55 pounds, it was really hard. 2 years ago I was put on a medication known to cause metabolic changes and weight gain in some. I could not stop eating and gained 10 pounds in a few weeks, I was then switched to a different medication...and lost the weight again. My willpower is the same, but the circumstances meant it wasn't enough to keep my weight down even though theoretically I should have been able to not gain weight. I am tying to say that not all situations are the same and since I had the medication episode I am far less arrogant about people's ability to lose weight if they just want to.\n\nI also think that putting so much emphasis on weight loss detracts from the importance of exercise for health and quality of life when older.

On one end, you have the sort of populist movement that has been watered down for the masses. Reappropriating \"curvy\" to mean overweight or fat, for instance. On the other end, you have the crazy SJW types who think their doctors are fat shaming when the doctor expresses concern that their weight will cause health issues. \n\nThe crazy, radical side of things is not and never will be mainstream. Just look at feminism. We're, what, 40-50 years past the beginning of 2nd Wave feminism and *Beyonce* is a feminist icon, not the man hating lesbian who lives on a lesbian commune. It will never be accepted in the mainstream that morbid obesity can be caused by genetics alone. It'll never be accepted in the mainstream that a doctor is prejudice or hostile because he suggests seeing a nutritionist or starting an exercise routine. The concept of \"thin privilege\" will never be mainstream. \n\nWhat will end up on the mainstream end of things is that it's OK not to hate yourself or your body because you're overweight.

Fat people might be the largest demographic that it's still socially acceptable to openly or publicly mock. People might think you're an asshole, but you won't face the kind of social retribution that comes with mocking and bullying a gay or black person today.\n\nIt's also important to realize that the entire fat acceptance movement mostly involves young people, at least in my observations. While being overweight surely effects the self esteem even of adults, people seem less concerned with such things once they're married and have children, which is the time in life that a lot of people end up overweight.\n\nYounger people, though, have more fragile self images in general, and can find their social lives heavily impacted by being overweight. It seems pretty common for overweight women to talk about how invisible they feel. Men don't talk to them or befriend them, let alone date them. \n\nYoung people have more to gain through the fat acceptance movement than older people. This itself limits the possibility for the movement to impact the mainstream in a widespread way. \n\nAnd last, if your concern is that the FA movement will normalize obesity, it's too late. That happened long before fat acceptance was really a thing. You know those older fat people I mentioned? The ones that go out to all you can eat buffets and don't exercise while using their kids as an excuse? They normalized it a while ago. We don't even blink when we see fat people use the mobility scooter things at Walmart that are meant for handicap people.\n\n**TL;DR:** The fat acceptance movement ranges from the moderate and benign to the radical and harmful. It's unlikely the harmful elements of the radical side will make it into the mainstream. It's more likely that you see \"you're beautiful; love yourself\" type messages come out of the movement, which is probably an important thing to hear for the young demographic that fat acceptance largely appeals to. And there's no reason to fear that the movement will cause the normalization of obesity in society, because that's already happened.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify/be more concise, the populist side of the fat acceptance movement is almost entirely about body image and anti-bullying, from my observations.

The authors of this material are lying to themselves and to others about the effects of their lifestyle. I liken it to smoking or drinking; we all know and accept the risks of these choices and choose to either keep engaging in them or do something about it. I'm not writing a blog refuting liver cirrhosis as an effect of a lifetime of alcoholism, I'm not accusing my doctor of \"shaming\" me when she tells me I need to quit smoking. Excessive weight, after a certain point (an earlier point than you might think), carries the same risks. If that's the way you want to live, I've got fuck all to say about it.

Professional sports clearly promotes an unrealistic image of athletic ability.  Most people can't play for the NFL, or MLB, or be an Olympian, or whatever.\n\nFurther, this glorification of unrealistic athletic standards is strong enough in its pull to create actual unhealthy behaviors.  For example, steroid abuse, cheating, and other methods at achieving the \"ideal\" athletic standard.\n\nYet there is no serious or even quasi-serious movement to normalize doping, or cheating, or even shitty baseball playing.  Doping is universally reviled by every serious sporting organization, and when Lance Armstrong dopes he becomes the most hated man in America.  When Olympians cheat they are kicked out, and the stigma is so strong that even transgender athletes are looked at with suspicion for having an \"unfair\" advantage.

FA is unique.  There are many unrealistic standards foisted on us in athleticism, financial success, etc., and none of them spawn \"acceptance\" movements.\n\nIn my view this is much better explained by analogy to the smoking companies back in the 80s.  There was a growing awareness for a long time that smoking was unhealthy, but because so much of the economy was invested in it, it became important to \"accept\" and \"tolerate\" the unhealthy behavior, with things like smoking areas in restaurants, on planes, smoke breaks, taxes instead of banning, etc., that died out (and in some cases, are still dying out) only gradually.\n\nI don't know if that's 100% the right explanation for FA, but it's way better than blaming \"unrealistic media standards\" which exist everywhere and spawn acceptance movements very rarely."}, {"id": "cn82qgf", "body": "I think the real problem is that we're over compensating against the abuse of unrealistic images.

In fact, it tends to have the opposite effect. it is that we accept fat people per se, but we shouldn't actively try to have them feel less about them self because that really doesn't work. \n\n  Your parents did live in a skinnier time but they also lived in a time where portion sizes were under control and it was a lot cheaper to eat healthy. Those times have changed. "}, {"id": "cn833oq", "body": "Shaming fat people doesn't do anything to make them more healthy.

Well, we could all just mind our business and model healthy lifestyles for the people around us.  \n\nAs a general rule it's rude to bring up stranger or acquaintance's shortcomings whether this is couched as \"concern\" or not.
