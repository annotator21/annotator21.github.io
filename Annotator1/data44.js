One is from Ethiopia, and two grew up in Mississippi.  All three are black and obviously one of them is African. This proves utterly nothing about the popularity of the holiday or what it is \"supposed\" to be about. \n\nOf the sources for kwanzaa's popularity, I'm apt to believe the BIG study, as there's little reason for it to skew the figures in anyone's favor (another user pointed this out already). Even so, that a large group of people don't celebrate, or make half hearted attempts at acknowledging, a holiday has nothing to do with whether the holiday itself has a specific meaning behind it.  A more fruitful discussion would be on the motivations and history of the holiday. A cursory glance at the Wikipedia entry reveals it was made by and was popular with the black nationalist movements of the 1960's as a means of opposing Christmas, but was later reformed so as not to exclude practicing Christians. If it were made by a group of white people out of a desire to promote tolerance, I would think your view would have some merit, but the truth of the matter seems to negate it in my view. It can't be a holiday focused on guilt over the treatment of black people if it was made by black people, for black people, to put it perhaps more crudely.\n\nSo there you have it.  It is a black nationalist holiday that was altered so as to be less polarizing, and is centered on celebrating African american heritage. That others use it as a means of assuaging their purported guilt does not alter this meaning, it just reveals an aspect of someone's character of which you do not approve.  And of course, just because you haven't witnessed even a single genuine adherent to the holiday means nothing with regard to whether the holiday is a legitimate one.

It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way, but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid. THAT is the issue. Everyone has a mind that works in its own way.  \n\nThe problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role, the problem is a black and white educational system. \n\nTreating everyone the same way, other than special classes for \"dumb\" kids is the problem. \n\nLearning seems hard or dumb to some kids and thats because its not tapping into their mind right.  \n\nIf a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus.

In particular:\n\n- The months are uneven. It's confusing to have irregular fluctuations in the length of months. Only one month having 28 or 29 days? Alternating between =31 and &lt;31 days, only to reverse at August? There's no reason to have a complicated calendar just because some ancient emperors had oversized egos. 365 has few factors, so a perfect division is not practical, but we can at least do better than what we have: months 1-5 have 31 days, and months 6-12 have 30, for example (month 6 would get Leap Day).\n\n- Months do not line up with seasons. The equinoxes and solstices that define the seasons. Why have the season start 2/3 of the way through the month when they could just happen on the first or second, making that entire month in one season (or close enough)? It would also keep the months as part of division hierarchy: four seasons to a year, three months to a season. As a consequence of this change, the year also wouldn't start in the middle of winter. New Year's Day can be the first day of spring. *Edit* Based on some of the responses I've been getting, it seems like a lot of places use the term 'season' more colloquially, with summer just meaning 'when the days are longer and warmer' rather than 'the space between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. To clarify, this latter meaning is the one I've going by. Harvest, hunting, basketball, and tourist seasons are all regional, but the ones that relate to axial tilt are universal, as far as I can tell.\n\n~~- School and financial years are misaligned with calendar years. Why have the 2014-15 school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar?~~ This one has been answered; Financial years have no set times, and school years vary too much by region to try to align them with a universal calendar. View changed, in this respect.\n\nThese are the three particular objections I have. To change my view, explain why these problems are necessary, or at least why fixing them would cause other problems (apart from the practicality of adopting a new system to begin with).\n\nI am well aware that actually getting the world to adopt a new calendar is highly impractical, but such practical concerns are beside my point, so I don't intend to argue about that. I'm also not going to bother with appeals to tradition.\n\nSo change my view.\n\n**Edit**\nThere's been some confusion regarding my intentions here. I am well aware that the costs of switching calendars would be huge, and not worthwhile for the relatively small benefits of having a more consistent system. However, if I allowed for that consideration when constructing my post, I wouldn't have bothered to post it because my view would have already been changed.\n\nThe basic question I'm interested in is this: are there good reasons to have any of the inconsistencies that the Gregorian calendar currently has? If we were to make a calendar from scratch, is there any reason to have irregular months rather than regular ones? Is there any reason to have the year start in the middle of winter rather than changing at the same time as a new season? These are the parts of this that I want to hear about, not whether it can be implemented.\n\nIf it helps you focus on the matter at hand, here's a rephrase: I have a button that, once pressed, will retroactively switch the current calendar to one with the \"fixes\" I describe above. This change is instant, seamless, and will carry no cost apart from the effort to press the button. Convince me not to press it.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In the southern hemisphere, the Christmas and New Year celebrations within the Gregorian calendar, when everyone has lots of time off, aligns with the middle of summer, just when people don't want to work, already.

Why have the 2014-15 school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar?\n\nAs others have pointed out, fiscal years can begin throughout the year, even if the main one's start in April and January. The school year in Europe is designed so that children can have as much of summer off as possible, and a brief Google leads me to believe this is true of other regions (thus meaning Australians are now having their summer holidays).\n\nUltimately I see no profit in this rationalist's need for an even calendar. It's true that the development of the Gregorian calendar has been perverted by religion, kings and so forth, but its longevity alone must be a sign that it is a least somewhat suited to the rhythm of modern life.

Why have the 2014-15 school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar?\n\nAnd so you would change *the calendar*? Not, say, the timetable for the school year? School years are only weird like that in some places. In many others, a single school year actually *does* line up with a calendar year.

If a calendar must be imperfect due to the very nature of the thing it's measuring, why would we want to change to a new one? How many yearly man-hours of productivity would be saved by the change? How many years would it take for that benefit to offset the enormous confusion that would surely accompany changing something as basic and common as the Gregorian calendar? Switching from Imperial to Metric, for example, made sense because 1. every number is base 10 so calculations are stupidly simply, and 2. it just makes goddamn sense.

If such a law doesn't exist then I'd be surprised. \n\nAs near as I can tell, the law can find a way to get you if you're constantly trying to file frivolous lawsuits. That being said, the issue really is how do you prove a person intended a lawsuit to be frivolous ? I mean, the public thinks that the lady who took McDonald's to court over her spilled coffee was doing so frivolously. Well, once I read more about the case I discovered that no, in fact, the case had quite a bit of merit to it. So \n\nI'll use that case right now to illustrate the point : For those who don't know, a woman sued McD's because her coffee was too hot. She put it between her legs while she drove, got into some sort of minor traffic mishap and wound up spilling it all over herself. On the face of it, it looks like a clear cut case of frivolity. What the general public knew about the case was pretty much exactly what I related. She was just some bimbo who couldn't be trusted not to hurt herself with a cup of coffee. And she won. \n\nSo why did she win ? Because McDonald's had been told on more than one occasion that if they didn't lower the temperature of their coffee, they were going to get sued. I don't know how they did it but McD's somehow found a way to get coffee into a cup while it was pretty much boiling yet somehow showed no signs of boiling. It really was too hot. Not to worry though said McD's : That's the way our customers like it. Wrong. So what happened was that lawyers were lining up waiting for exactly the situation that occurred to occur. They all knew that McD's had been warned. They knew that it was a slam dunk. They knew McD's couldn't win because they'd been warned. Lastly, they knew that McD's hadn't done a damned thing about the volcanic temperature of their coffee in spite of everything.\n\nSo, as I said, what would have been a frivolous lawsuit in virtually every other case wound costing McD's a lot of money. It wasn't that they'd done anything special. In fact, it was precisely because they hadn't done anything at all that they lost. \n\nWell, a lot of otherwise ridiculous cases are exactly like this. In fact, the general public thinks that there are a lot more frivolous lawsuits than there actually are. Most of them are filed by people with mental health issues. Most of them aren't allowed to proceed at all. A waste of the court's time ? Yes. On the  other hand, because of the way the law works, we don't truly know which ones are frivolous and which ones aren't until some judge makes a call.\n\nThe system we have is about the best we can hope for under the current system. Further, I can tell you that it's not much different in other countries. In China if you hurt yourself, don't count on anybody to help you. Are Chinese people heartless ? No, of course not but a lot of the elderly have used it as a payday. Some old lady slips and you help her up. Bad plan...she may turn around and sue you. The worst part is that some court will likely agree with her simply out of sympathy for her situation.\n\nUnder the current system, what we have is about as good as can be expected unless you think it's worth the court's time to pursue every case it deems frivolous. After all, we're talking about people who usually have no money in the first place. It would cost us a lot more to throw them in prison.

This brings me to my first point, **law suits are the last method of redress** for most people.\n\nWhat does this mean? Let's say you and I agree that we both own X and I give you money for that exchange. Then, X becomes super valuable, and you say something to the effect of, \"Oh I was just kidding.\" I try to deal with you but I can't. Now, I try to work it out with you. I bother you for months but nothing happens. Literally, I have to go to a bigger badder authority to get you to comply. **Courts owe everyone a listen** because we should try to help the least of our citizens or non-citizens. \n\nSecond, courts have a responsibility to hear all cases that have a reasonable basis. They can only determine the reasonable basis once all of the facts are determined. The barrier to entry is just a colorable complaint. This second point plays into the first. **Courts are method for determining all of the facts that are applicable and relevant to the issue at hand** for most people.  Going back to our example, I'm super annoying and keep begging you to reconsider... \"Cmon! It was deal, you owe me money.\" Finally you say something like \"Ok, here's Y thousand dollars.\" I'm not really in a position here to determine if I'm being taken. X could be a plutonium mine worth millions or a semen stained dress that Penthouse wants to buy worth 8 bucks. The court compels you to show everyone your data. With legal instruments and testimony I can find out who paid what for our X. \n\nThird, **legal rules are complex.** It takes a guy who went to college and then three years of more college to learn 2/3's of these rules so he can say he's special and file legal requests that you must respond with. X might be worth millions, but the complex and archaic language and reasonings(which should be abolished to Neptune) may only entitle me to half of Y. So, this case was largely fruitless. But, I don't know why until after the fact. So, a big waste of time, money, and effort, yet, I and the opponent party are redressed according to the law when all facts and issues are discovered. Therefore, a fruitless case may simply be distrust or non-agreement playing out. \n\nFourth, Complainants legal fees are largely paid for by splitting the winnings. It's not important to know the proper name of that split, but you should know that it largely supports poorer people's suits. The logic follows this timeline. Attorney takes 10 cases and only three pay out. The first two are moderate and the third is big. These three cases paid for seven other people's suits. So, attorneys can end up taking long shot cases simply because they want to get their name out there and because they are able to. This practice theoretically helps smaller and poorer clients. \n\nFifth(one, two, three, four, fiiiiifffff), when reading your two specific examples:\n\n&gt;such as they don't like the color of paint on their neighbor's house\n\nWe don't know all of the facts until after the review of everything. This specific example may result in no remuneration. Rather, it could result in a simple repainting of the house. There probably are silly examples. We've all heard them. Part of the people that are supposed to protect the practice of law are the practitioners themselves. Often times, silly and ridiculous lawsuits brought repeatedly by complainant's attorneys will result in fines or a tarnishing of their names. I disagree that criminal charges should be brought. Keep it civil. Throwing people in jail is just a cost to the taxpayer. Cash and censure would work far better. Furthermore, this cost should be thrown upon the attorney, not the client. The attorney is the licensed practitioner. \n\nMy soapbox: What would help the practice of law are three main things(in my opinion): First, an overhaul of the legal language and principles to make it more understandable for common people. Today's system is largely based on nonsense terms from hundreds of years ago. Second, actual education to the public with these new and easier terms and concepts. Today's concepts are like algebra with variables that can change dramatically with very difference in inputs. If we simplify the legal concepts and teach them to our citizenry, we might find less suits. Third, there should be an overhaul of the practitioners of law. Judges should be legally trained but wholly separate from attorneys. Their intermingling creates a lax environment which makes for rather lax disciplinary action among colleagues. Moreover, if attorneys are the officers of the court, their enlisted or ordinary personnel(borrowing from military phraseology) should be far more abundant. This would allow for more representation at a cheaper cost. However, lawyers like big paychecks and want to feel important. They've stratified the profession through the removal of the way citizens unable to drop 150k on law school may become lawyers. This is done in order to keep their lofty status, but it has removed the ability of the middle and poor classes to gain acceptable levels of legal help.

"}, {"id": "cn47juq", "body": "&gt; If anything the bus boy and cooks deserve tips.\n\nIn most places, your server will split the tip with the bus boy, and possibly with other employees involved in your meal.\n\nBut to address your broader point:\n\nMost of the places where tips are expected are places where you experience some sort of luxury, and the people you tip are directly involved in making your experience more luxurious: the waiter brings food to your table and the busboy saves you the trouble of clearing your junk off of the table. The bartender deals expertly with the noisy environment to bring you your drink, custom made to your request. Tipping is both a way of saying \"thank you\" for providing you with a little piece of the good life, and socially signaling that you are well off financially, and it's no big deal for you to back your thanks with a bit of cash.\n\nTipping is also a way of signaling to friends and potential romantic partners that you are generous with small amounts of money (i.e., not a miser), and have an understanding of social graces and expected behavior in some social situations.\n\nIf you don't like tipping, you can avoid environments where tipping is expected. Eat at a fast  food joint, or at a counter, where you have to pick up your food and bus your own table, and you aren't expected to leave a tip. Stay at a hostel or a cheap inn rather than a hotel, and the staff generally won't expect a tip (and will also let you get your bags yourself). Take a bus or a train rather than a taxi, and you won't need to tip. But if you want to eat at nicer places, sleep in nicer beds, or get someone to ferry you to your destination in a single car, then you're generally expected to behave like someone who can afford luxury. Especially in the States, which is ostensibly a class free culture, you're generally to be generous to the people serving you in such situations, and leaving a tip means that you get this. It means that you don't take them for granted, and appreciate that they are taking the time to personally make your life a little nicer."}, {"id": "2q8qqi", "body": "First and foremost I would like to say that I do believe in tipping for extraneous service(Bartenders making your drink extra strong, doing a very good job, etc), but for the most part I do not think that I should have to tip people for doing their jobs(Waiters/Waitresses/Taxi's/Especially bartenders).

If they don't the managers are fined and the restaurants are shut down. \n\nIt is the employers responsibility to ensure that employees receive at least minimum wage. A customer cannot screw an employee out of a pay amount which it is not their responsibility to give. There is absolutely no legal contract you enter as a customer which obligates you fulfill the duties of an employer; you purchase an item (your food) and pay the advertised price for that item (the number on the menu). \n\nA tip is completely optional. The question is, do you have a more obligation to tip, or in other words if a waiter is somehow paid less than minimum ways, has an immoral act been committed by either the employer, the customer, neither, or both?\n\nAs a society, we have decided that minimum wage for work is an issue of human rights, and have written legislation to insure that employers are obligated to make this compensation, so I would argue that it is unquestionably immoral of an employer, by societal standards, to allow an employee to be paid less than minimum wage.\n\nThat said, what remains to be determined is whether it is immoral, as a bystander, to allow an employee to have wrong done to them by an employer when you *could* prevent that wrong at your own detriment.\n\nNow, I think most would agree that it is immoral to allow wrong to be done to people when you could prevent it at no cost to yourself. There are also some very compelling arguments for the immorality of allowing wrong to be done to others even when preventing it would be detrimental to yourself, but I personally don't believe this is the case in this situation.\n\nAlthough altruism in general is a necessary part of any society and certainly improves society, I believe that it is only necessary as moral action given certain conditions. \n\n1. That you are in a position where the detriment of your altruism to yourself is less than the benefit to the person receiving it.\n2. That your altruism would not be only superficially beneficial; that it will have a positive effect and not reinforce any situation which created the wrong to be corrected in the first place.\n3. That there is not another person or entity responsible for the wrong which you could prevent, who should therefore be first held responsible.\n\nIf all three of these conditions are met, I would argue that altruism is indeed a moral imperative and that purposefully avoiding it is a crime morally, albeit maybe not legally. However, it seems to me that tipping at a restaurant fails ALL THREE of these tests.\n\nFirst, you cannot assume that every single customer is in a position to pay more than the billed price for their food. I know many people that don't tip well because they can't afford to. Consider the case where we applied the same argument to a grocery store clerk and you were required to tip at the cash register when buying food at a store. Given this scenario with no more alternatives, I believe many more people would not be able to afford to eat; it is not reasonable to expect them to help directly pay the waiter or grocery store clerk because they would then experience financial difficulty themselves.\n\nSecond, that a waiter by default *deserves* a tip. As many people here say, it is not apparent that doing your job not exceedingly well but also not poorly merits excess pay. If the goal of the tipping system (as many claim) is to encourage better service, then you cannot also mandate tipping for service which is not necessarily bad but only meets the expectations of their job description, or else you will have the opposite effect. \n\nI also believe that waiting, as unskilled labor (if you take this as offense you should look up that term because you might be misunderstanding me) *should* be a transitional job and therefore reserved for people who are in between jobs or who aren't yet fully entering the work force. In my experience the socially acceptable minimum tipping amount (15%, 18%, even 20%) will most of the time lead to a total wage significantly above minimum wage, by anywhere from 10% to a 100% increase. If you are overstaffed and you don't receive many tips/hour because there is not one to wait on then this is a managerial problem and not a deficit in the customer's action. For this reason I believe tipping can encourage people to stay in what should be a transitional job for extended periods of time and therefore discourage developing a skill to contribute to a better workforce. In my opinion this is detrimental to society overall, and only increases the demand for unskilled jobs which leads to employers offering lower pay based on supply and demand. (Actually the fact that legislation for minimum wage is required shows definitively that people in minimum wage positions are often paid higher than they would if supply and demand determined who received those jobs, but I digress...)\n\nFinally, and this is the big point for me, the employers are responsible for employee wages and therefore should justly be held responsible for it. As described above, as a society we agree that it is immoral for an employer to pay less than minimum wage, and yet somehow we end up with legislation that directly contradicts this principle and allows employers to pay less based on the fact that waiters may or may not receive optional tips.

How many other minimum wage jobs do you tip at? The answer is most likely zero or possibly 1 or 2. Does this imply that no one goes above and beyond in any of those other jobs?

The question is, do you have a more obligation to tip, or in other words if a waiter is somehow paid less than minimum ways, has an immoral act been committed by either the employer, the customer, neither, or both?\n\nAs a society, we have decided that minimum wage for work is an issue of human rights, and have written legislation to insure that employers are obligated to make this compensation, so I would argue that it is unquestionably immoral of an employer, by societal standards, to allow an employee to be paid less than minimum wage.\n\nThat said, what remains to be determined is whether it is immoral, as a bystander, to allow an employee to have wrong done to them by an employer when you *could* prevent that wrong at your own detriment.\n\nNow, I think most would agree that it is immoral to allow wrong to be done to people when you could prevent it at no cost to yourself. There are also some very compelling arguments for the immorality of allowing wrong to be done to others even when preventing it would be detrimental to yourself, but I personally don't believe this is the case in this situation.\n\nAlthough altruism in general is a necessary part of any society and certainly improves society, I believe that it is only necessary as moral action given certain conditions. \n\n1. That you are in a position where the detriment of your altruism to yourself is less than the benefit to the person receiving it.\n2. That your altruism would not be only superficially beneficial; that it will have a positive effect and not reinforce any situation which created the wrong to be corrected in the first place.\n3. That there is not another person or entity responsible for the wrong which you could prevent, who should therefore be first held responsible.\n\nIf all three of these conditions are met, I would argue that altruism is indeed a moral imperative and that purposefully avoiding it is a crime morally, albeit maybe not legally. However, it seems to me that tipping at a restaurant fails ALL THREE of these tests.\n\nFirst, you cannot assume that every single customer is in a position to pay more than the billed price for their food. I know many people that don't tip well because they can't afford to. Consider the case where we applied the same argument to a grocery store clerk and you were required to tip at the cash register when buying food at a store. Given this scenario with no more alternatives, I believe many more people would not be able to afford to eat; it is not reasonable to expect them to help directly pay the waiter or grocery store clerk because they would then experience financial difficulty themselves.\n\nSecond, that a waiter by default *deserves* a tip. As many people here say, it is not apparent that doing your job not exceedingly well but also not poorly merits excess pay. If the goal of the tipping system (as many claim) is to encourage better service, then you cannot also mandate tipping for service which is not necessarily bad but only meets the expectations of their job description, or else you will have the opposite effect. \n\nI also believe that waiting, as unskilled labor (if you take this as offense you should look up that term because you might be misunderstanding me) *should* be a transitional job and therefore reserved for people who are in between jobs or who aren't yet fully entering the work force. In my experience the socially acceptable minimum tipping amount (15%, 18%, even 20%) will most of the time lead to a total wage significantly above minimum wage, by anywhere from 10% to a 100% increase. If you are overstaffed and you don't receive many tips/hour because there is not one to wait on then this is a managerial problem and not a deficit in the customer's action. For this reason I believe tipping can encourage people to stay in what should be a transitional job for extended periods of time and therefore discourage developing a skill to contribute to a better workforce. In my opinion this is detrimental to society overall, and only increases the demand for unskilled jobs which leads to employers offering lower pay based on supply and demand. (Actually the fact that legislation for minimum wage is required shows definitively that people in minimum wage positions are often paid higher than they would if supply and demand determined who received those jobs, but I digress...)\n\nFinally, and this is the big point for me, the employers are responsible for employee wages and therefore should justly be held responsible for it. As described above, as a society we agree that it is immoral for an employer to pay less than minimum wage, and yet somehow we end up with legislation that directly contradicts this principle and allows employers to pay less based on the fact that waiters may or may not receive optional tips. I think this is terrible, I believe that this type of law should be repealed and we should allow competition for minimum wage waiting jobs to take place naturally, where employers hire people at full minimum wage based on their merit as a waiter, and then additional income from tips is *completely* optional. How many other minimum wage jobs do you tip at? The answer is most likely zero or possibly 1 or 2. Does this imply that no one goes above and beyond in any of those other jobs? I don't believe so, and I don't think it's reasonable to insist that there is something special about waiting that differentiates itself from these other jobs.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for listening to my opinion. I'd love to hear *anything* about what you think of it, whether you agree and would like to add to it, or you disagree and would like to **explain your reason for disagreeing about something specific,** so that we can discuss it further.\n\nI'm generally not interested in discussion about your gut feelings, or how skillful or exerting waiting can be, or the negative effects that a lack of tips can have on a waiter's life. I'm interested in discussing the basis and morality of the currently accepted tipping system and of possible alternatives. Thanks again!\n\n"}, {"id": "cn46i9q", "body": "&gt; Restaurants are businesses which mean they regularly get checked by the government to make sure that they are operating legally. If they don't the managers are fined and the restaurants are shut down.\n\nI worked in  restaurants for the better part of a decade, and from my experience most restaurants don't follow this rule. I didn't work corporate chains,  which I would guess are more likely to do so. \n\n&gt; First, you cannot assume that every single customer is in a position to pay more than the billed price for their food.\n\nIf we assume, and as a culture we have, that tips are part of the cost of eating in a restaurant, then yes we can. If you can't afford to tip, then you shouldn't eat out. \n\n&gt; Second, that a waiter by default deserves a tip\n\nWe've decided that culturally.  I agree that the tipping system is absurd but it is what it is. I'd love to see it changed.\n\n&gt; If the goal of the tipping system (as many claim) is to encourage better service\n\nAgain, this is cultural.

There are professional servers and baristas and bartenders all over the world. There are places where it is a \"real job\" and they make a real wage. If you've ever had a truly great server you'll understand what it means. \n\n&gt; Finally, and this is the big point for me, the employers are responsible for employee wages and therefore should justly be held responsible for it. \n\nCulturally we have decided otherwise. \n\n"}, {"id": "cn40q0m", "body": "There's also a lot of laws regarding speed usage on the road, lane usage, signal usage... and in theory, everyone follows those laws.  \n  \nIn reality, not so much.

I've been a waiter before, and I've lived in both America and Australia, one of these countries tips waiters, one does not. Australia has no separate wage for tipped employees and as a result tips are only provided for exceptional service.\n\nYes, it is true, if no one tipped, then the restaurant would be required to pay full minimum wage to the employee. But I would argue that tips are still a valuable part of the model for 2 main reasons.\n\nA. In Australia, where no one tips, you have very little recourse for poor service at a restaurant. Your choices are complaining to management, or never going back. It makes a very real difference in the service you get. When I was serving, I would bite my tongue very often, I'd move along, do my best to just act as nice as possible regardless of the customer's actions, because I knew that every bit here and there made a difference on how much money I made. But if I knew basically the line was \"Not going to make any money off them anyway, so just don't get a complaint to management\" then I know I would've treated a lot of customers way different.\n\nB. You said \"but when they start acting like they will starve to death if you don't tip...\" and I think it is a fair point to look into. Do you think that a minimum wage of $7.25 is a fair wage, or a wage that someone can live on? A wage of $7.25 is $15,080 a year. Just taking out federal income tax and medicare/social security, it comes down to less than $13,500 a year. Then figure rent and other unavoidable bills...

Peter Jackson only has rights to those two works, so a huge amount of the history of middle earth that Tolkien wrote in other books (like the Silmarillion, which was pretty much an entire history of middle earth) have been changed wildly, and often condensed to much smaller time periods for the sake of making it easier for the movie-goer to understand.

It involves not having to pay child support.\n\nI've seen this concept floating around and initially dismissed it completely as guys wanting to shirk responsibility and be deadbeats. I also thought it could be too easily exploited, especially if men got cold feet about having a baby and, after claiming to support the woman, decided to screw her over by taking the financial abortion option.\n\nHowever I've thought up ways in which such a law could actually be feasible.\n\n1. If intending to get child support from the father of a child, the woman MUST inform him as soon as possible about the state of her being pregnant, at least by the 8th week. Maybe he can sign a document saying he knows she's pregnant.\n\n2. The father can only decide to opt out and have the financial abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy. If he doesn't opt out by then, he loses the right to opt out. (The 10 week thing is because pregnancy is pretty obvious by then but the woman's body hasn't been morphed much it looks like. This can be changed, I just based it off looking at pictures.)\n\nThese laws mean that a woman can decide, with plenty of time left over for contemplating abortion, if she wants to keep a baby and raise it as a single mom. If she can't raise it on her own she might want to abort, with no great medical risk compared to the risks of pregnancy.\n\nI think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it. I think it is also immoral to force a man to pay for a child he didn't want. If a woman can't raise the child without the father's support the moral thing to do would be to abort the child.\n\nThis law would obviously be relying on abortion being freely available in the area. It would probably be a very bad idea to implement it in the South of the USA, for example.\n\nSo CMV that this law is feasible. I would like people to discuss loopholes, extenuating circumstances and also if this law would be unfair to women in any way.

It would be nice if men could have all the sex they want, and if the woman happens to get pregnant despite taking precautions, they can avoid that affecting the rest of their life. That's great for the men. But for society, it means more children growing up with less financial support.
