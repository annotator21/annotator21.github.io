The health system, because of various legal and ethical requirements, offers a large amount of information and the barriers to accessing credible information on your own is actually extremely low. These people are informed enough to be able to understand whether a new medication would be an improvement for them.\n\n1b) More importantly people in general, but especially the people from 1a, are extremely well informed about *their* disease; that is their own illness experience. This experience may be unique or highly atypical. Most diseases have a variety of symptoms and most medications have a variety f side effects that occur with varying intensity and have different effects on different people's lives. There are people who can't take medicine that makes them groggy or demotivates them because of their work. Some people may just react badly to a particular medication. Advertising lets people know there are multiple options and that these options have different costs and benefits that can be weighed against each other. \n\n2a) I think the viagra example was really good. But the purpose served by advertising is to let people know that their problems (back pain, chronic head aches, joint stiffness, fading vision, and a host of others) are a) treatable, and/or effectively or painlessly treatable and b) possibly signs of a more serious condition. People are really reluctant to go to the doctor (because of fear, hassle or cost); these hads can be a powerful motivating factor. \n\n2b) Doctors can't be trusted to make a decision *alone*. They may literally not know the drug exists; they usually have many patients and no time to keep up on every innovation even if that's all they did. They are sometimes paid to prescribe certain drugs and when they aren't the information they are given is gated by pharmaceutical companies; this is especially important when talking about generics (Most of this post is from a Canadian perspective, but this problem is especially important in the States). They may not understand the particulars or gravity of your needs or otherwise disregard them and so won't seriously consider your offer. \n\n3) Medication access has a series of gatekeepers (both doctors and pharmacists for start) which your post doesn't acknowledge at all; you act as if most advertised drugs can be bought over the counter (which, AFAIK, is definitely not true). If you go to them and ask for a new drug that's expensive or ineffective, or dangerous they'll probably say no. The most important gatekeeper is the FDA which makes sure that drugs that do make it to market are not literally poison, so at the very least there's no problem of patients going to doctors asking for random chemicals; they'll be asking for chemicals that, on balance probably help more than they hurt and the doctor can add his/her own experience and knowledge to increase the likelihood of a good decision.\n\n"}, {"id": "2pxv61", "body": "Medicine and it's adminastration should not be marketed on tv because it is not the sort of product that the average consumer can make an informed decision about from a commerical.

Prozac can't tell you their are better than Wellbutrin because they work in completely different ways and the one that is more appropriate for you will depend on the neurotransmitter imbalances upon which your depression is derived.\n\nAs a result they don't even address the fact that they have competition.  Ideally, the commercials are supposed to be about \"Hey we exist and we may be able to help.  Go do more research and ask your doctor.\".  \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of people don't like that whole research part and instead get caught up in the not so subtle tactics of consumer psychology.  Pair images of people being frolicking through fields to some cheery music with your products name and logo, and a large portion of people will look no further into the issue and go ask their doctor for that product.

Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product, but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine.

For example, the heavily-advertised arthritis drug Vioxx is estimated to have **caused around 115,000 heart attacks \u2014 and thousands of deaths** \u2014 in the U.S.(2) But Vioxx was **no more effective than cheaper, older alternatives**. Not everyone took Vioxx because of the ads featuring Dorothy Hamill effortlessly skating around the ice, but market research suggests that **up to four in 10 prescriptions for it were prompted by advertising**.\n\n&gt;**Turning normal into a problem**: **Many ads aim to convince people who feel fine or have minor symptoms they need a medicine.** Pills are presented as magic solutions for life problems such as shyness, inattention at school, sadness, anxiety or insomnia. An analysis of TV ads found medicines were often associated with images of happiness, regaining control over life, and social approval.(3) **Non-drug approaches like diet or exercise were never presented as a true alternative**.\n\n&gt;**Increasing drug costs**: Drug companies advertise new, expensive medicines because they\u2019re the big money makers. For example, Astra Zeneca spent over one billion U.S. dollars advertising Nexium to the American public, but **generic omeprazole, which isn\u2019t advertised, has the same effect at a lower cost**.(4) Health economist Steve Morgan estimates that **if public drug advertising is allowed in Canada, drug costs will go up by CDN $10 billion per year**.(5)\n\n&gt;**Poor information quality**: Supporters of direct-to-consumer advertising say it provides needed information on health and medicines. However, **basic facts, such as how likely a drug is to work, are usually missing(6) and the risks involved are often downplayed**.(7) People need unbiased, accurate information on the pros and cons of all available treatments, not glossy ads that present a pill as a magic solution.\n\n&gt;**Bad Choices**: Supporters also claim drug advertising gets needed treatments to people sooner.

A car or a paper towel has attributes than can be discussed in a commerical in a way that the consumer can understand. They use commericals to inform consumers as to why the product is a better choice than the competition by discussing what is done differently. \n\nMedicine is not marketed by talking about what chemicals are in it relative to the competition, rather they show clips of patients enjoying life while listing a crapload of deadly side effects. Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product, but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine. Yes it is also true that doctors get the final say it is only with there perscription that a purchase of medication can be authorized, so then I ask why do we need the commercial in the first place? Why not just send doctors a brochure of the latest in medication? \n\nThere is also an arguement to be had for the \"vote with your dollar\" concept of capitalism, but in my view medicine is exempt from this because no one wants to have to buy medicine and no one who is not a doctor is qualified to say which medication is \"better\", as well as the fact that most consumers are not going to try a variety and medicines and keep buying that which they like the best as is the case with shampoo or food. To me, commercials for medicines are a shameless way for pharma companies to plug something and make money. Pharma should not be about profit, but results. The fact that the commercials are legal seem indicative of a dangerous trend of \"profit before well being\" that is present the industry. CMV!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In my view, LGBT couples are already married, regardless of the legislation that is imposed on them. Marriage isn't a set of civil rights that confirms your connection to your partner, it's the choice you make to be in private, daily, lifelong commitment to another being.\n\nTradition dictates that in order to be 'properly' married you have to exchange vows, get a ring, and have a massive celebration (the set of traditions change based upon the culture.) But marriage isn't that, it is simple commitment to another person. The main issue that gay marriage has is that not all couples are given the same civil liberties, but this does not mean that their marriages are void. Marriage isn't decided by bystanders, it's decided by the people who live inside the union.

Those people didn't suddenly start loving each other more because they were married, they were crying happy because they felt included and equal to everyone else. \n\nThat's to say nothing to the societal impact of having legal gay marriage. In places where it is not allowed, it keeps alive a social stigma against LGBT persons, legitimizes it a way that goes beyond a simple social contract. Marriage is a symbol, and denying it to certain group is a symbol as well. When bi-racial marriages were illegal, was that really about the fact that the people didn't have the same legal rights, or was it about the continued prejudicial treatment of minority group with the explicit purpose of discriminating against that minority.\n\nThat's why the issue is one that needs to be framed around marriage. It's a symbol, and those sort of things are extremely important for affecting real change. If you legally legitimize gay marriage, you legitimize the rights of LGBT people as equal not just in marriage, but as citizens who are equally valued as their heterosexual counterparts.

I'm not even really talking legally (though feel free to inform me), but wether I am negatively influencencing the \"victim\" company(s) with this.\n\nThis of course excludes remakes, GOTY editions and other versions that add (substantially) to the game, assuming you own the vanilla version. This does not include \"better graphics on PC\" or \"Keyboard/mouse support\".By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it, buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product, solely because the rivalery of companies (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) prevents cross-buy.   \n\nExpanding on my personal buying behaviour, 90% percent of the time I wouldn't have re-bought the game anyway, and am doing it purely for convenience (bought on Xbox, torrenting on laptop so I can play it when I'm gone too) so the developer/console-company won't make a loss on my illigal copy, and the other 10% of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for PC for, say, the mods (which are fully made by people outside the company, and do so for no profit), and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right (i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox, and  bought Fable: TLC in a Steam sale for $3 so I could play it again with mouse + keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on PC, I wasn't interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore, I wouldn't have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already.) \n\nYou could argue that in theory, I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games, and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine, therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think that's  a risk you take when you're selling your machine at a loss, and if that business model doesn't work for you, change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very, very low, and is but a minor dent in the ten/hundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement, not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldn't be buying their consoles anyway if it wasn't for their exclusives, which as the name suggests, are exclusive to that console. Along with that, pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the \"machine-developer\" middle man and makes the \"loss\" go directly to the game developer.\n\nI think that's pretty much it, I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it, feel free to use those of course. Also, I do apologise if this has been asked before, I did a quick search before posting and found nothing.

So here goes: Having bought a game on one platform, it's not immoral to pirate the same game on another platform. I'm not even really talking legally (though feel free to inform me), but wether I am negatively influencencing the \"victim\" company(s) with this.\n\nThis of course excludes remakes, GOTY editions and other versions that add (substantially) to the game, assuming you own the vanilla version. This does not include \"better graphics on PC\" or \"Keyboard/mouse support\".By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it, buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product, solely because the rivalery of companies (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) prevents cross-buy.   \n\nExpanding on my personal buying behaviour, 90% percent of the time I wouldn't have re-bought the game anyway, and am doing it purely for convenience (bought on Xbox, torrenting on laptop so I can play it when I'm gone too) so the developer/console-company won't make a loss on my illigal copy, and the other 10% of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for PC for, say, the mods (which are fully made by people outside the company, and do so for no profit), and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right (i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox, and  bought Fable: TLC in a Steam sale for $3 so I could play it again with mouse + keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on PC, I wasn't interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore, I wouldn't have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already.) \n\nYou could argue that in theory, I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games, and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine, therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think that's  a risk you take when you're selling your machine at a loss, and if that business model doesn't work for you, change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very, very low, and is but a minor dent in the ten/hundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement, not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldn't be buying their consoles anyway if it wasn't for their exclusives, which as the name suggests, are exclusive to that console. Along with that, pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the \"machine-developer\" middle man and makes the \"loss\" go directly to the game developer.\n\nI think that's pretty much it, I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it, feel free to use those of course. Also, I do apologise if this has been asked before, I did a quick search before posting and found nothing. Maybe my arguments make for a different approach to the case.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Therefore, I wouldn't have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already.) \n\nYou could argue that in theory, I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games, and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine, therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think that's  a risk you take when you're selling your machine at a loss, and if that business model doesn't work for you, change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very, very low, and is but a minor dent in the ten/hundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement, not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldn't be buying their consoles anyway if it wasn't for their exclusives, which as the name suggests, are exclusive to that console. Along with that, pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the \"machine-developer\" middle man and makes the \"loss\" go directly to the game developer.\n\nI think that's pretty much it, I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it, feel free to use those of course.

You can't feel a way about a fact, it is as it is.\n\nEven ignoring your faulty assumption that companies always respond rationally, this is wrong.  Companies absolutely do think that people pirating the PC copy, even if they've bought the Xbox copy, is hurting their bottom line.  This is a basic fact about pirating and there's no way to meaningfully discuss pirating if you don't recognize that companies disapprove of it.  \n\nSome consumers would, and in fact do, buy multiple copies of games for different systems.  Pirating allows some of those consumers to pirate the alternate copy and therefore lowers the revenue of the game maker.  If it didn't, game manufacturers would include licenses for downloading the game on different machines.  They don't because they want consumers to buy multiple copies if the consumers wishes to play on different systems.  \n\n&gt; I don't want more than what I payed for, in fact I insist on getting the exact same thing, only with the convenience of having it on the go on my laptop/getting mods/play with my friends who own the other console, neither which are selling points the developer influences\n\nAgain, this is a blatantly untrue claim and demonstrates a severe misunderstanding about what you are purchasing and what you are pirating.  You purchase \"An Xbox Game.\"  When you then pirate the PC copy you are getting \"An Xbox Game + Something more than you can't get with just the Xbox game\".  Whether that \"something more\" is convenience, the ability to mod, the ability to play against your PC friends, you're clearly getting something extra that doesn't come with the Xbox game.  You are getting stuff for free that didn't come with the version of the game you paid for.  And like I said, in commerce, getting something more always costs more.\n\n~~Look at it this way, can you identify any errors in the following logical progression:~~\n\n~~It costs money to purchase the ability to play the game on PC.  Taking something without paying for it is stealing.  Therefore, taking the ability to play the game on PC, without paying for it, is stealing.~~  \n\n~~Can you come up with any *facts* that make any part of that statement untrue?  I'm looking for facts, not rationalizations.  The fact that you bought an Xbox copy does not make any part of the above statement untrue.  The fact that you would not pay for the game if you couldn't pirate it does not make any statement in the above untrue.  Can you think of anything that makes the above untrue?~~\n\nScratched the above because, while I think it does speak to pirating being wrong, it doesn't address my original position.\n\nIf you don't believe that content creators view pirating as harmful, then this is a pointless discussion -- we're coming at it with a completely different view of the world.  If you do believe that content creators view pirating as harmful, then I stand by my original claim:\n\n&gt; In both cases you are taking something you desire, something that has no necessity in your life, while knowing full well that doing so causes pain to someone else.

Not all places require business licenses.  For example, [in Arizona:](http://www.azdor.gov/Business/LicensingGuide.aspx)\n\n&gt;not all businesses are required to have a license and some businesses are required to have more than one license. There is not a \"generic\" state business license.\n\nApart from that, even in places where there is generic licensure, it doesn't necessarily follow that this sort of restriction can or should be tied to it.  You do address this, and I think it's the crux of the thing.\n\n&gt;The government serves the public interest, and businesses are regulated to ensure that they do so as well.\n\nBusiness regulations aren't always tied to licensure, and at least in the United States, these types of regulations are typically not tied to any licensure status.  So they have to stand on their own as a good or bad law, not just part of a licensure scheme.\n\n&gt;Imagine a business where the owners have a belief that they don't have to pay taxes. Guess what? They are forced to pay taxes. Imagine a business that produces toxic waste, but the owners have a belief system that exempts them from responsibility. Guess what? They are still responsible.\n\nOk.  Are you saying that refusing to put a particular decal on a cake for a customer is the same as refusing to pay taxes or dumping toxic waste?  I don't see the analogy very well.  In both cases you describe, there is a major monetary gain to be had by breaking the law.  In this case, there's no reason except personal conviction to refuse.\n\n&gt;If one gets a business license, they already know what the existing requirements are to run a business, and they also know ahead of time that the government has the power to regulate businesses so they serve the public interest.\n\nThat doesn't answer the question of what the law *should* be though.  The link provided by the OP also indicates that this sort of case has never been brought on this sort of basis in that jurisdiction (Northern Ireland).  It's pretty hard to say you'd know the rules on that if this is the first case.\n\n&gt;Having beliefs is a right, but running a business is not. And at this point in time, when you run a business, you have to comply with regulations, regardless of your beliefs.\n\nThis again doesn't say what the regulations should be.  There are regulations which would clearly be impermissible to impose as a condition of having a business license.  If a law was passed requiring all business owners to vote Republican as a condition of their licensure, it would clearly be impermissible.\n\nWhy is a law requiring that business owners assist in political speech different from that?  Freedom of speech is a core right which is right up there with the right to vote for whom you choose."}, {"id": "cn0qy4p", "body": "&gt;In order to run a business, one needs a business license from the government.\n\nSometimes, depends where you are and what you want to do.  Not all places require business licenses.  For example, [in Arizona:](http://www.azdor.gov/Business/LicensingGuide.aspx)\n\n&gt;not all businesses are required to have a license and some businesses are required to have more than one license. There is not a \"generic\" state business license.\n\nApart from that, even in places where there is generic licensure, it doesn't necessarily follow that this sort of restriction can or should be tied to it.  You do address this, and I think it's the crux of the thing.\n\n&gt;The government serves the public interest, and businesses are regulated to ensure that they do so as well.\n\nBusiness regulations aren't always tied to licensure, and at least in the United States, these types of regulations are typically not tied to any licensure status.  So they have to stand on their own as a good or bad law, not just part of a licensure scheme.\n\n&gt;Imagine a business where the owners have a belief that they don't have to pay taxes. Guess what? They are forced to pay taxes. Imagine a business that produces toxic waste, but the owners have a belief system that exempts them from responsibility. Guess what? They are still responsible.\n\nOk.  Are you saying that refusing to put a particular decal on a cake for a customer is the same as refusing to pay taxes or dumping toxic waste?  I don't see the analogy very well.  In both cases you describe, there is a major monetary gain to be had by breaking the law.  In this case, there's no reason except personal conviction to refuse.\n\n&gt;If one gets a business license, they already know what the existing requirements are to run a business, and they also know ahead of time that the government has the power to regulate businesses so they serve the public interest.\n\nThat doesn't answer the question of what the law *should* be though.  The link provided by the OP also indicates that this sort of case has never been brought on this sort of basis in that jurisdiction (Northern Ireland).  It's pretty hard to say you'd know the rules on that if this is the first case.\n\n&gt;Having beliefs is a right, but running a business is not. And at this point in time, when you run a business, you have to comply with regulations, regardless of your beliefs.\n\nThis again doesn't say what the regulations should be.  There are regulations which would clearly be impermissible to impose as a condition of having a business license.  If a law was passed requiring all business owners to vote Republican as a condition of their licensure, it would clearly be impermissible.\n\nWhy is a law requiring that business owners assist in political speech different from that?
