Fat acceptance is not the same thing as fat promotion. It's about not believing that peoples size and shape does not dictate their worth as a person. It's also to some extent believing that if you are not someones treating doctor, then their health status is none of anyones business. To me, its simply about refraining from fat shaming.\n\n2. Being obese has undeniable health risks when looking at population health. But so do many other people things yet I don't see many people shaming people who engage in sports like horse riding or snowboarding or occasionally binge drinking, or riding motorcycles, or lying in the sun, or boxing, or playing football or bungee jumping - all of which are definitely lifestyle choices that come with definite health risks, and ones that can be very expensive, such as years of residential brain injury rehabilitation in the case of the traumatic brain injuries that can sometimes result from some these activities.\n\n3. Fat acceptance is not the same thing as skinny shaming. Plenty of people who are part of the fat acceptance movement can't stand stupid skinny shaming lyrics about boys and booty etc or people who ask slender people if they have anorexia etc. I know I raged at that song and delighted in some of the spoofs of it pointing out the obvious flaws\n\n4. Anorexia is an incredibly dangerous mental illness and its entirely possible the climbing rates of it may relate to our generally very fat-hating society. I don't know of any published studies on this specifically but they may be out there. There is most certainly plenty of data around things like exposure to women's magazines \n\n5. Dieting, in the words of my food eating and body image psychology lecturer is 'the biggest cause of obesity' - whilst we all know people who are shamed into losing weight, many more out there don't lose weight or gain weight. If shaming worked, the rates of obesity would be pretty close to 0. Obesity rates keep climbing so why not try acceptance? Also the most evidence based treatment for obesity is gastric surgery,  yet fat shaming often involves a theme of fat people being weak, lazy and lacking willpower, which is likely to keep them away from the treatment statistically most likely to actually work with huge health benefits that would save both the individual and society money over time, because accessing surgery is often stigmatized as the lazy fat person taking the easy way out.\n\nJust a few thoughts, not sure if I've raised much new. I will add that as a mental health professional,  I could never ethically suggest shaming people as a strategy to promote a healthy behaviour change,  and facilitating positive behaviour change is essentially my bread and butter. It is not really an effective strategy and can create more problems than it solves. Have a look at the motivational interviewing literature for stuff that actually helps. And it starts with not being judgemental."}, {"id": "2qoom3", "body": "Since America has a larger population in general compared to other populations, more people are able to speak out about being bullied for their size.

I put on a bit of weight a while back and I was getting that. It wasn't fun. It doesn't hold a candle to what overweight women go through. Women face constant, direct judgment from all directions about their appearance, and are made to feel as if they are lesser people for it.\n\nSo this fat acceptance stuff needs to be looked at through that lens. At its core it's about simply not being judged as a person for your appearance, not having strangers feel entitled to tell you what they think about it. It's something that every woman needs, not just the overweight ones. Now, the problem occurs when a whole bunch of people get ahold of this very reasonable idea that women shouldn't have to face social pressure about their appearance, and tug it every which way until we end up with the things you object to like skinny-shaming and ignorance of health issues and shaming people who are attracted to healthier body types.

Acceptance I perceive as telling people that it is not wrong or shameful to be obese or even just having a bodytype that doesn't align with our cultural paragon. It's the difference between telling someone that they shouldn't feel inherently bad about themselves and telling them that they SHOULD feel inherently good about themselves. It is of course positive to be healthy, but the progress of our society is no longer as dependent on individuals being physically able, fat acceptance is about acknowledging that.\n\n&gt; and shames those that don't have a more 'natural' body type or don't find these body types attractive.\n\nAgain I'm going back to the key term acceptance. If you hold true to that word, then even as an individual who is not sexually attracted to an overweight individual you still should not attach a stigma to that person based on their appearance. As in \"I wouldn't bang you but I'm not thinking less of you as a person because of that\".\n\nOf course this is all just my own perception on what the fact acceptance movement means. It's moving away from our evolutionary avoidance of those who are, to whatever degree, viewed as unhealthy or of a physical stature that is non-optimal for survival. It's moving beyond our pre-programmed tendencies to judge individuals on the basis of some Darwinian scale.\n\nThose who would argue that it is good to be fat, or wrong/oppressive/unacceptable to be closer to a cultural paragon bodytype (or just to prefer that bodytype sexually) are totally missing the point of fat acceptance, in that it's about realizing as a culture that there is no longer an inherent \"goodness\" or \"wrongness\" to looking a certain way."}, {"id": "cn8qc82", "body": "Glorification?\n\nThat's all it is.

"}, {"id": "cn8831y", "body": "What you don't realize is that fat people don't need encouragement to be fat. They're fat because they're addicted to food, which has developed due to the endorphin rush they get from consuming it to self-medicate depression or anxiety. It's easier to get very fat very quickly these days because cheap, processed food packs a bigger caloric punch AND it's been engineered to be \"Just right\". The taste, the texture, the moisture, the salt and sweet... it's all been carefully balanced and tested.\n\nCelery hasn't. There are shitty things about celery, even if you like celery (the strings, man... the strings). But a Twinkie? Nope. Pure heaven.\n\nFat people need psychiatric help, period. Their problem isn't with food, that's just a symptom. Telling them not to eat is like telling an alcoholic not to drink, and all the \"shaming\" or \"acceptance\" isn't going to change how they feel about themselves.\n\nConsider, almost every fat person was once \"normal\" at some point in their lives. Every fat person knows that food makes them fat. Every one of them that is still fat chooses BY THE HOUR to stay that way. They keep jamming food into their mouths to make the feelings stop.\n\nI have a friend who hovers around 300 lbs and she's 5'6\". She gets slightly fatter every year, though she tries to stay under 315. Yes, that's right. My goal is to keep under 140, to put that in perspective. She eats around 4000 calories a day. She binges, hides food, hoards food, turns into a megasaur bitch if you keep her from food for too long... the works. She's an alcoholic, but with food. She's been that way since high school, though I think she was \"only\" 230 back then. She's 40 now and no diet in the world has worked for her because she loves sugary, fatty shit and tons of it. She eats to feel better and being thin wouldn't make her feel better. She eats because no one loves her (her parents are not the best people in the world). Her brother, who is thin as a rail, just got away from the parents when he was 18, but she stayed in town, begging for their love and stuffing her face. It's sad, but her eating has nothing to do with whether her \"body type\" is ideal or not. She eats because she is miserable in the inside. That's why alcoholics drink.\n\nShaming makes fat people eat more because they get a little extra misery to self-medicate, but making them feel better about being fat doesn't make any difference. And, frankly, if someone WANTS to be fat and likes themselves that way, who the fuck cares? Let them. It's no business of yours. And if someone is able to make you feel bad for being of a normal weight, why? I've never in my life felt bad for being normal. I don't have to explain or justify how I look to anyone, not my family, not my friends, and not strangers.\n\nThis is one of those MYOB things. Leave the fat alone and live your own life.

If you run the same amount week after week, your body will burn the calories expended during the run itself, but your metabolism will basically *demand* you continue that level of activity if you don't want to actually *gain* weight.

I'm fat right now. I've been skinny. Before that I was fat. I've been on both ends of the spectrum. I know when I'm fat. I also know that health wise, being fat is not OK. Currently I have bloated up due to a combination of medicine that makes me hungry and make me hokd the weight and issues stemming from the weight gain itself- self esteem issues and depression. For me food is an addiction. In my life I have quit smoking and I have lost weight- quitting smoking was the far easier task. With smoking, there is never a reason to smoke. With weight and eating... Even on a diet you still need to eat something... So it's easier to fall off the wagon. Imagine if an alcoholic tried to quit, but still had to have a mandatory 3 beers per day. It probably wouldn't work out. \n\nI do not accept the idea that people need to think I'm attractive or that they need to think my health is OK. I might not be attractive to many people right now and my health is not OK. What I do accept is that overweight and obese folks should be treated like humans with dignity and respect and no one should shame them. (No one should shame skinny girls either.) Why? In my case I'm already ashamed and I have to assume a great number of other fat people also feel ashamed. When some one shames me... It sends me right to the fridge or the nearest Starbucks. I eat the pain away and for lack of another way to think of it, I get high. The times I've lost weight were when people just ... Left me alone and let me deal with it on my own. \n\nSo in part I support that over weight people should be treated respectfully and in most cases do not need their weight pointed out to them. They know. And if they claim not to, they are in denial and pointing it or won't accomplish anything. So I don't think that the far acceptance movement is all bad. No one is being fooled into thinking that fat is healthy, just look at the media reports. It's all over. You'd have to be blind, deaf, and dumb to think otherwise. \n\nI would say that the fat people who think they are beautiful are a minority that is fed  by fetishist's and people who have a different cultural perspective.  And that is fine, people are free to think what they want, but by and large... I don't see that aspect of it growing and I wouldn't let myself be bothered by it... It's like reading the blog of a foot fetishist and thinking that will become the norm.\n\nI know a lot of people point to pop culture like that Meghan trainer song \"all about that bass\" or whatever... But that song isn't about obesity. It's about having a slightly fat butt, big boobs, or just not being a size 2. Size 6 is fine, right?  It's more about accepting body type. The only obese person in the video is a dude. Every one else is pretty average looking really.  But what you find is that even people who are a size 6 wish they were a size 2 or wish they didn't have cellulite or wish they had a smaller/bigger butt/boobs. Even when I was skinny, I was never happy with my body so I know how that feels too. \n\nSorry if I have rambled, I'm on my phone and can only read the last 2 sentences I've written, but hopefully I've gotten some sort of point across.\n\nEdit: freaking auto correct"}, {"id": "2qoom3", "body": "Since America has a larger population in general compared to other populations, more people are able to speak out about being bullied for their size.

Yes, it's true that morbid obesity is correlated with a number of health risks. However, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n**1) The mainstream beauty ideal in America (i.e., what you see in models, what gets portrayed in ads, etc.) promotes a weight that would be unhealthy for most women to try to achieve.** There are two points to take away from this.\n\nFirst of all, there are plenty of women who don't meet that standard and who are not necessarily unhealthily overweight. The measure of how \"overweight\" someone is is often taken from a standard that is, itself, unhealthy. \n\nSecond, a lot of professional models/celebrities are practicing dietary habits that are just as if not more unhealthy than those of moderately overweight people. Yet they don't face nearly the same level of shaming or stigma, on Reddit or out in the world. If health was all people were concerned about, they would presumably shame these sorts of people just as much as they shame moderately overweight people.\n\nTo go even further: why even stop at things that are \"unhealthy?\" Why not look at all risks factors? Buying a motorcycle almost certainly endangers your life more than being 10 pounds overweight. Why don't we shame motorcycle riders in the same way we shame fat people. \n\n**2) You cannot tell how healthy a person is just by looking at them.** Body's have different natural set points. Some people are naturally a little more thin, and some people are naturally a little heavier. There are plenty of people who are skinny who eat very poorly. There are plenty of people who eat relatively healthy, and exercise more than the average American, and still look a little heavy. If you're trying to shame people for unhealthy lifestyles, shaming purely on the basis of how they look, or their weight, is an incredibly presumptuous and ineffective way to do it. You cannot tell how at-risk someone is for heart disease by looking at them. You cannot tell how clogged a person's arteries are by weighing them.\n\n**3) Even if being fat is unhealthy, why is it your job as a stranger to tell them to stop?** This is the point that, I think, is most surprising when it comes to reddit. Reddit is happy to defend fat shaming on the grounds that we as a society should discourage people from this \"unhealthy lifestyle.\" Yet, to go back to the earlier example, if someone made a post encouraging people to go out and verbally harass and shame any motorcycle rider they see, they would probably be told to mind their own business, or live and let live, and they would probably be downvoted into oblivion.  \n\nBasically, I feel that a lot of people on Reddit try to rationalize their shaming of fat people by falling back on the argument that it's \"unhealthy.\" This argument often doesn't hold up when you ask them their views on other unhealthy lifestyles. It's also fundamentally weak, since weight is not even close to a perfect indicator of general lifestyle or health. \n\n**EDIT** also, because reddit loves statistics: there is no evidence that the \"fat acceptance movement\" is encouraging unhealthy lifestyles. Rates of obesity doubled from 1980 to 2000, but have leveled off since then.

If a person is overweight, they probably already feel bad enough about it, so why would you want to make them feel worse? Tough love? Arguable, but if it isn't your own child or whatever then you have no business telling them how to live their lives.\n\nOn the other hand, educating people that being fat is perfectly healthy is simply lying to them because even if they are currently healthy, in the long run obesity leads to many health problems and a shorter life expectancy. Spreading the idea that certain people are simply going to be fat and others simply will be skinny regardless of diet/activity level just poisons the mind of the uninformed and encourages them to live the same lifestyle that likely led to them being overweight in the first place. \n\nEDIT: Also, since you mentioned it in the question, fat people should not shame skinny people any more than skinny people should shame fat people, and if you're overweight and you comment negatively on a skinny persons weight, don't be overly offended if they return the favor.

Here's a copy-paste of my analysis of it.\n\n\nYou'd think the author might have stopped after beginning their article with \"I only became recently familiar with the subject of this article and do not understand it\" and considered whether they were really in a position to be writing an article on it, but then the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) is a motherfucker.\n\nReally, every single point in the article is completely full of shit, but the main reason for this is that the author has no understanding whatsoever of what Health at Every Size is. HAES is a movement that promotes assessing one's health on the basis of their diet and level of exercise, rather than their weight. So the idea is that if you're eating well and getting regular exercise then that's good, and if you're not, that's bad. Whereas conventional dieting would claim that if you're losing weight that's good, and if you're not, that's bad. So if a fat person began lifting weights and put on muscle while losing an equal weight of fat, that would be considered to be good under HAES, but bad under conventional dieting. On the other hand, someone employing a starvation diet to lose weight, resulting in muscle atrophy and putting them in a bad position to rebound to an even higher bodyweight would be considered bad under HAES, but good under conventional dieting. HAES also encourages people to find forms of exercise that interest them, and they are likely to stick with, rather than pushing boring forms of exercise like distance running, or use of expensive machines like ellipticals. The benefits of such an approach should be obvious, but they aren't merely hypothetical. The evidence shows that HAES actually is undeniably effective. [[1]](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091104123025.htm) [[2]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17526295) [[3]](http://www.nutritionj.com/content/10/1/9)\n\nSo with that in mind, let's look at the article's points one by one.\n\n1) America is extremely accepting of fat because \"with upwards of 60 percent obesity in certain cities, you can\u2019t say that America is not accepting of fat people\".\n\nYeah, right, and because there are areas of the US that have black populations of upwards of 60 percent, America also can't have racism.\n\n2) \"Body positivity\" should include health.\n\nIt does, as the author would have known if they had even bothered to do as little research as reading a Wikipedia article before they started writing.\n\n3) Health at Every Size seems physically impossible.\n\nIt's just a name. It's not supposed to be taken literally. In reality, HAES does not actually promote trying to be healthy while remaining obese. Instead, it says that if you are obese, then you should try to be healthy. (Well, strictly speaking, it says everyone should try to be healthy.) The difference between HAES and a a conventional approach to weight loss is that HAES would just prescribe diet improvements and exercise, and focus on whether the person is eating well and getting exercise and not worry about the numbers on a scale, whereas the conventional approach would focus primarily on weight loss, seeing diet an exercise as nothing more than a means to lose weight. A HAES practitioner will definitely lose weight as a result of this change, but the difference is that the weight loss was not the goal, rather health was, and the weight loss was merely a side-effect.\n\nAs for the misrepresentation of HAES as promoting anorexia as well, anorexia is an obsession with mainingint a low body weight, so how the hell can you be anorexic while following a movement that eshews meauring bodyweight? If anything, HAES is a treatment for anorexia, not a cause.\n\n4) People are allowed to be attracted to certain body types.\n\nI'm pretty sure the author just made up their claim that anyone was ever alleging otherwise.\n\n5) Food addiction is a real medical problem.\n\nJust another strawman by the author, with no evidence to suggest that anyone is actually defending consumption of junk food.\n\n6) Childhood obesity is something we can't be accepting of [and] we can't say that [HAES] is safe for children\n\nHAES is about promoting healthy eating and regular exercise. Is the author seriously claiming that that isn't safe for children? Apparently so, and not only that, but promoting bullying as an alternative, which not only tends to act as a barrier to fat people taking up exercise, thereby perpetuating unhealthy lifestyles, but also adds the risk of youth suicide. Wonderful.\n\n\n**TL;DR: HAES and the fat acceptance movement do not encourage unhealthy lifestyles, and are actually much more effective at helping people reducing their body fat levels than either conventional dieting, or fat-shaming. HAES works by promoting healthy lifestyles which would result in body fat reductions for overweight people, but without making one's bodyweight the sole means of assessing one's health.**"}, {"id": "2qoom3", "body": "Since America has a larger population in general compared to other populations, more people are able to speak out about being bullied for their size.

When you say you \"eat whatever you want\", do you mean you regularly eat 3,000-4,000 calories of food a day?  Because if your body needs 2,000 to maintain weight and that's what you're eating, it doesn't really prove anything.  \n\nPersonally I know that if I had to eat whatever I want, I would start piling on weight in no time, because i can certainly put away a lot more than I need before being sated.

I'll use myself as an example, but first, skill vs talent.\n\nSkill is ability and aptitude, talent is natural inclination towards specific aptitude. Given skill (x), with equal amounts of invested effort, someone with talent will excel to a higher level of mastery than someone without talent. Now that that's out of the way.\n\nPeople complementing a skill is not empty. Considering the above description, when people complement a skill they're actually complementing your mastery of that skill. Regardless of how you attained that mastery, whether you were talented \"as I am at piano\" and only practiced a few hours a week to attain mastery, or if you were like most of my peers, who practiced about 2 to 3 hours a day, every day, with heavy training to attain mastery. One is commendable as a recognition of natural inclination, which in itself, is remarkable. The other is recognition of dedication and fortitude, which in themselves are quite remarkable.\n\nA complement does not recognize something given, it is not often a given in the how you attained your mastery, they may know you've attained it, but the mixture of effort, natural inclination, pressure, or even how serious you were in pursuing it are often unknown unless you volunteer it. Celebrating mastery and recognizing another persons proficiency is a way of connecting and understanding another's worth, it's normal social dynamic. \"You bring a certain mastery to the table, one I likely do not and will not have, that is valuable, and implies a remarkableness in either talent or perseverance.\"\n\nChin up op and take it with swagger.

The CCP mostly obeys a set of laws that they have created, which allows for the growth of industry. They also seem to be reasonably good at fiscal and monetary policy. Finally, as you mention, they are providing the necessary infrastructure for the future.\n\nHowever, none of this suggests that the CCP is actually *necessary*. \n\nChina does not have the rule of law, since laws can be broken, changed, or ignored at will by the CCP. China is better described as rule *by* law, in which the CCP uses law as a tool of control, while not themselves being controlled by the law. This is irksome to many foreign business, who often find that contracts with Chinese business and state-run enterprises are more of a symbol of good relations than a legally binding document. Good fiscal and monetary policy are present in many non-repressive countries.

Go to page 14 for the average growth rates of democracies and autocracies. The punchline is that on the whole democracy's win. \nUnder this view, the CCP hasn't actually brought anything to the table, they've just stopped fucking up. While it's commendable that they are no longer run by a Mao, that doesn't mean that they are doing anything necessary. Nothing the CCP has done is special. \n\nLooking toward the future, the CCP will likely outlive its usefulness in the rest of China as it has already in Hong Kong. When that day comes, if the CCP does not start allowing more freedom., expect high levels of oppression and violence as the party attempts to maintain power over the Chinese state in the face of increased public opposition. We are likely living through an era of relatively low oppression, sandwiched by higher levels of autocratic abuse, because that is what the party's system is designed for.

Instead it is best to define morality in a certain context. \"Do unto others as you'd want others to do unto you\" is one such context. Utilitarianism is another. There are literally dozens if not hundreds or thousands and no single context holds a monopoly on moral truth. In fact different contexts should be used depending on the situation and what you're evaluating.\n\n/u/old3nglish is simply pointing out that the OP is using only one moral system out of many and working under the assumption that it is the objectively true one and that anyone who disagrees with it is simply wrong, which old3nglish and I don't believe is correct.\n\nThat said does our subjective view of morality still disqualify us from this discussion?"}, {"id": "cn8pb7x", "body": "Yes, we both grasp that whether morals are objective or subjective they can be discussed, which is why it is odd that you would forego discussing the actual topic for discussing what we agree is irrelevant.

Really THE question if you ask me. And my answer is that yes, its all nature in a sense, but to me, *all of morality* is an entirely human construct that society has invented. As such, I don't think it necessarily makes sense to apply our moral concepts to non-human agents, such as the entirely hypothetical advanced beings being discussed. But murder, fighting over territory, and yes, even the treatment of animals by humans are literally exactly the sorts of reasons why the concept of morality exists at all.\n\nNow, bear in mind, none of this is necessarily defending human consumption of meat. If we value the lives of animals, it makes a ton of moral sense to work to reduce their suffering.

I don't agree that is worthwhile, but I accept it is a valid argument. There are prominent philosophers the just outright assume (sometimes without strong argument) that: Suffering is Wrong. Then they proceed from there to create moral systems based on that assumption. This is possible because it is a shared trait, created as you say from its value to increasing survival and thus can be reasoned about for most living things.

This seems to be the case with modern human history. But I really don't see why we should presume this to be the case with non-human species or even future human society. Once could certainly imagine other moral systems that have evolved under different conditions, such as colony insect like beings that place no value on any particular individual.

Science fiction is full scenarios like this, some very unlikely and outlandish, but nevertheless some of them seem possible.

I don't agree that is worthwhile, but I accept it is a valid argument. There are prominent philosophers the just outright assume (sometimes without strong argument) that: Suffering is Wrong. Then they proceed from there to create moral systems based on that assumption. This is possible because it is a shared trait, created as you say from its value to increasing survival and thus can be reasoned about for most living things. It also happens to be a convenient way for someone that already thinks animals like mammals should be given strong moral considerations to justify that believe with an internally consistent moral theory.\n\n\n&gt; sufficiently advanced civilization will have discarded it, therefore it is not a good, long term metric to justify the consumption of meat\n\n\nI see no reason to suppose this, unless you already have the notion that moral views (not what morality IS, but rather what views being hold) evolves toward more empathy, compassion and discouragement of violence. This seems to be the case with modern human history. But I really don't see why we should presume this to be the case with non-human species or even future human society. Once could certainly imagine other moral systems that have evolved under different conditions, such as colony insect like beings that place no value on any particular individual. Or high rate of reproduction species that eat their young, lest their young live long enough to eat them and replace them in their role in society. Science fiction is full scenarios like this, some very unlikely and outlandish, but nevertheless some of them seem possible.

Similarly, a bird is not suited to the atmosphere, it is suited to short flights. A bird would not survive on a gas giant if we could find an altitude and atmosphere to mimic the conditions in which they fly.\n\n&gt; A naked human can't survive below certain temperatures, right? So if we're trying to tell a group of alien anthropologists where they can find humans on the planet earth, we'd conclude that humans won't be found anywhere that drops below freezing.\n\nNot entirely, caves tend to hold at about 40\u00ba F and provide a natural shelter. But the anthropologist would rightly conclude that humans wouldn't have originated in those climates and that the humans would use some mechanism to either alter themselves (clothing) or alter their environment (fire) in order to survive there.\n\nYour argument is that these things are intrinsically part or our species, instead of part of our potential. We can and have been known to be parted from them, often taking a long time to regain them, either individually or as a community, and yet still survived.

I'm trying to imagine what our ecosystem must look like from the perspective of an very alien race of beings, some vastly different set of organisms.  I don't think they'd do much parsing between the human organism and the technology they create and use for themselves.\n\n&gt; We can and have been known to be parted from them, often taking a long time to regain them, either individually or as a community, and yet still survived. We our not inseparable from our technology the way the bee is from its hive.\n\nI'd not considered that aspect.  But a lot of organisms have different phases or stages, and I think that's how it would look to an alien observer.  One stage is the primal existence stage, doing our best to survive off of strength and cleverness, and then there's the community and technology building stage, where we're able to outfit ourselves with a number of coping strategies for many different environments.\n\n&gt; Each individual does not instinctively know how to craft the tools we wield.\n\nWhat difference does it make how the coping strategy functions, provided it functions?  On the scale of the planetary ecosystem, it's made no difference that each individual human could not instinctively create a gun.  They were still able to use them to hunt many other organisms to extinction and endangerment.  And I think that's the crux of the argument.  It makes no difference to the other organisms in the ecosystem and the ecosystem itself how we happen to categorize the things the human organism does.  However we define the use of tools and technology, we're still affecting the ecosystem as though we were an organism that did the same thing on instinct.\n"}, {"id": "cn8090v", "body": "&gt; I think measuring of how \"highly evolved\" something by how dominant its species happens to be is a fairly good measure.\n\nIf by \"dominant\" you mean number of members of a species alive on the planet, then by that logic, germs/viruses/single-celled organisms ([maybe this one?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagibacter_ubique)) are likely the current dominant species."}, {"id": "cn8ax5c", "body": "I'd argue that humans are the most powerful clade.  we can bend pretty much anything to our will and do whatever we want.  our main danger is ourselves."}, {"id": "cn8ax5c", "body": "I'd argue that humans are the most powerful clade.  we can bend pretty much anything to our will and do whatever we want.  our main danger is ourselves."}, {"id": "cn8bm5g", "body": "&gt; we can bend pretty much anything to our will and do whatever we want. our main danger is ourselves.\n\nThe same can be said for germs, though they don't even need to fear themselves."}, {"id": "cn8bm5g", "body": "&gt; we can bend pretty much anything to our will and do whatever we want. our main danger is ourselves.\n\nThe same can be said for germs, though they don't even need to fear themselves."}, {"id": "cn8cex7", "body": "they lack the foresight that we occasionally make use of.  perhaps I'll turn out to be wrong in the end, but I really do feel that arguments against the sole wielders of technology are ultimately asinine."}, {"id": "cn8cex7", "body": "they lack the foresight that we occasionally make use of.  perhaps I'll turn out to be wrong in the end, but I really do feel that arguments against the sole wielders of technology are ultimately asinine."}, {"id": "cn8cpwa", "body": "My point is that the definition of dominant or evolved is arbitrary--I've gone through like three in this conversation.

It is pointless to say whether it would care if it was eaten: it doesn't even care if it dies. \"Caring\" is a trait of consciousness; the animal avoids death only because evolution has created instincts that force it to. In fact, mice have had their fear of death switched off (forgive my phrasing here, haven't seen the video in a while), and they simply died. They didn't care. To care about death, one must be able to ask questions about death, and fear the unknown. Mice can do none of that. You'll find information about that mice thing in this Vsauce video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbdMMI6ty0o[1]  \n\nMakes sense to me, but I'm not a psychologist.\n\n&gt;Again, to show that morals are not fixed.\n\nYea, but where does this come into the question of whether it's inconsistent for people to eat and not want to be eaten?  Is the point that there is no morality, so inconsistency is impossible?  Forgive me, if I've missed something you've said.  I can accept your discussion of instinct/consciousness with no major objections, but I don't see how we get from moral relativism to resolving the inconsistency between eating animals we think may have some aspect of consciousness.      "}, {"id": "cn81ymu", "body": "&gt; So the United States Government isn't real?\n\nThis analogy is not quite valid. The US government has physical institutions of marble and concrete. Morals are just a concept. The government is an entity in a similar way to morals, but it is absolute rather than relative as morals. It is defined by a Constitution and must exist within this construct. Similarly to morals, it is a human device to make life easier. But it is real because it is absolute and not subject to individual interpretation. A person can have no morals, but they can't wish away the US government. The US government is real and based in reality.\n\n&gt; Well most of the time we don't use 'real' in such a strong way. No, they may not be eternal facts about the universe, but they certainly are real things in that people experience them and we're able to talk about them.\n\nI have been using real in the definition of eternal facts of the universe. Humans have a very limited perception of time, and things that seem \"real\" and longterm in human scale are incredibly transient from a universal lens. But the point is, we had a misunderstanding of terms. And you're right, most people don't use \"real\" in the sense that I did.\n\n&gt; Things can have symbolic value we bring to them. A life can have a symbolic value that we bring to them, words can have symbolic value, etc.\n\nYes, that is exactly the point. Meanings are an entirely invented idea by humans. In the universal scale, there is no meaning. I am not arguing against humans creating meanings: they are a helpful illusion that allows us to live life happily. But they are not real in the universal sense outside the perspective of humans.\n\n&gt; it's silly to say there's no meaning to life, when phenomenologically we give life meaning all the time.\n\nWe give ourselves meanings, yes. These are human illusions. But in the grand scale of all life, there is no point to any of life happening. If you subscribe to evolution, then you know that at one point there existed only anaerobic cells conducting just a few basic chemical reactions. What meaning does this cell have? Is it not life? *Humans* give *humans* meaning: it is a figment of our imagination that is supported by our cultural institutions. What is silly is to say that all life has meaning: define the meaning of a cell or a walrus. Reproduce is the answer, but that's just a chemical reaction. Surely the cell is not reproducing because there is a cosmic importance to doing so.\n\n&gt; It may not be an objective fact about the universe, but that doesn't make it not real.\n\nIf it is created solely by the human mind, then of course it is not real. Are unicorns real? Of course not. When you perceive abstract, *human* notions as \"real\", illusions that only serve to ease the pain of existence, you are affirming yourself. It is natural and right to do this, because you are protecting yourself from painful questions about the world. But you are also obscuring the truth: human meanings and symbols are not real.\n\n&gt; Not necessarily. Kant would like a word.\n\nI haven't read Kant; he's on my reading list, trust me. But even philosophy can't change the fact that relative and absolute are opposite words.\n\n&gt; Illusion is a strong word that I don't think is appropriate here. You can use it if you'd like, but I don't think how you describe the process of finding meaning is quite accurate.\n\nIllusion is the right word, because we perceive the world through our lens of meanings. If the meanings are not real in the universal sense, which is true, then they are illusions, falsehoods, albeit necessary, which we choose to believe. Please read the book I recommended you, I'm just restating points that the book explains better than I can.\n\n&gt; Showing that meaning is something human bring to the world doesn't mean that morals are necessarily relative.\n\nJainists believe that stepping on a fly is immoral. I can kill flies all day without feeling a twinge of sorrow. A soldier can kill a person and feel nothing, and so can a murderer, but I can't. Arguing that morals are not relative is a hopeless battle.\n\n&gt; Is the point that there is no morality, so inconsistency is impossible?\n\nThe point is that morals can be different for everyone, and can be changed. There is morality if you choose there to be so; even if you do choose morality, it doesn't exist in the universal sense. Morality is just a construct of man, part of man's innate urge to have a meaning. Inconsistency is a given of morality, because each human sets different things (killing a fly) at different points on their good-bad continuum. It is possible to have an \"official guide\" to morality, where rules are set about how moral different things are. This is called a code of law. Murder and rape are bad, but it's fine to kill a fly. If you decide not to kill a fly, that's up to you, but society agrees that it is immoral to kill a person.\n\n&gt; I don't see how we get from moral relativism to resolving the inconsistency between eating animals\n\nI'm defining a popular boundary for eating animals for OP in relation to that animal's intelligence. The boundary is the consciousness/instinct line, which is binary. OP says it is morally wrong to eat meat: I say that morals are relative, and define that in depth.\n"}, {"id": "cn7yxer", "body": "Morals are an entirely invented human phenomenon.

This is true the same way that a sheep applying sheep morals (herding is good) to humans doesn't make sense. It's just solving the wrong problem.\n\nHowever, there is one way in which human morals might apply to eating other animals, and that is if there is some way in which it helps us get along better with other humans, who otherwise would fight us about it. This is basically why it's morally wrong to eat pets. \n\nIt's not because you're applying human morals to pets, that's just stupid. It's because you're trying to get along with other humans.\n\nNow... another species would have this same situation. If there's no benefit in terms of getting along with other members of *their* species, there's no reason why *their* morals would apply to eating humans. \n\nOur morals might find them evil, in the same way that a sheep's morals infer that wolves are evil creatures. \n\nNow... I think we could make a pretty serious argument that traveling all the way to Earth to eat humans is a pretty wasteful use of resources. Physics makes it essentially impossible that this could ever be beneficial to either side. \n\nAnd if they are intelligent, then we could come together and decide together that a wider society that included both humans and aliens was better for both of us.

There's a lot more that goes into a decision of \"am I ok doing this\" than whether or not it's moral. People are ok doing bad things every day knowing very well that they aren't moral. That being said, your point is that my NOT being ok with something (someone eating me) means that I have to think it is IMmoral..this is faulty logic. Not every moral thing will benefit me in some way and many moral things may actually disadvantage me (just thinking reasonable/realistically), so I therefore may not like these things or be ok with them, but they are still moral (a silly example off the top of my head would be I stupidly bet someone hundreds of dollars and lose. I am very much NOT ok with giving up hundreds of dollars but it would be immoral to go back on my word).\n\nAnyways moving on from that:\n\nPoint 2. No, preying on an animal for meat to survive is not the same as raping a woman for pleasure.  That being said, a lot of animals live that type of lifestyle where the dominant sex just kind of 'takes' sex when they want it, although usually there is some type of consent from the less dominant (usually female).  My point here is that if we didn't romanticize sex as much as we do, maybe a more casual air to sex would be possible.  I think the difference between us and animals is that animals mate to reproduce, they (I don't think) think \"I'm going to rape this weak lady squirrel just because I can.\" So no, saying that it's natural to prey on animals for food to survive is not the same as trying to dominate and rape a weak woman for pleasure.\n\nPoint 3: You're right, cats don't have morals. This is what I meant at the beginning of my first post when I said you're taking a natural issue and trying to make it a moral issue.  You're trying to place these socially constructed ideals of right and wrong on the most basic, primitive, natural instinct which in my opinion can't be mixed.\n\nPoint 4. Maybe you can get all the nutrients you need now a days without eating meat (I acknowledge other forms of protein and stuff) but you can't deny that, considering the most basic definition of what is 'natural' that hunting and eating meat is totally natural.  I'm not sure what the point about compassion has to do with it.  Yes we have the ability to feel compassion for animals, this doesn't mean eating them is immoral and I don't think leads to 'one day not eating them'\n\nPoint 5.  How would our ancestors have gotten the nutrients they needed way back when? Did they have tofu back then?
