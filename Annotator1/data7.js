Even if 2 out 3 legs have made contact, the harpoon wouldn't shoot. And it was known there was a very high degree of possibility that the lander may bounce on every bounce.

(Ex. *Event A will cause Event B.*)\n\n- **Indeterminism** : No event is certain, and the entire outcome of an event is based on probability, or **chance**. (Ex. *Event A might cause Event B or Event C.*)\n\n**BACKGROUND** \n\nAfter the 18th century, most scientists agreed that the universe was deterministic, that it was governed by strict scientific laws that could be discovered and applied to determine the outcome of any event. Thus, determinism seems to challenge the possibility of free will. If one accepts determinism, then the universe, and any person in it, is governed by strict scientific laws. This means that any event, including an individual's choices could be determined based on scientific knowledge and causality, or cause-and-effect. However, advancements in quantum mechanics challenged determinism, ultimately proposing a universe that follows general scientific laws but one which does not have a predetermined future.\n\nIt was Werner Heisenberg who discovered indeterminism within the measurement of basic variables. Heisenberg's experiments and analysis showed that uncertainties always occurred when attempting to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were fundamental in the universe and are inherent mathematical properties in quantum mechanics. Voila! Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the basis for quantum tunneling and how nuclear fusion occurs in stars.\n\n**MY VIEW / PERSONAL**\n\nI am a twenty-five year old nuclear engineer, and as you probably guessed it, I work at a nuclear power plant. I spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy, from a scientific standpoint. This past weekend, I had the wonderful privilege of going on a series of dates with a rather remarkably intelligent, and beautiful, young woman. To my surprise, after a few drinks, we were discussing very riveting topics, one of which based around **\"Free Will\"**. We both agreed that chemistry and physics define the universe around us, and since humans are made of matter, we are also governed by those scientific laws as well. If this is truly the case, humans exist in a deterministic universe where everything can be predicted, even our decisions... given enough scientific knowledge. Conclusion: \"Free-Will\" is an illusion.\n\nNow, fast-forward to two days later. I'm still thinking about the discussion and bending my mind around any way to disprove my theory scientifically. (I personally love to play Devil's Advocate to my own theories.) I haven't been able to, and actually, I've further convinced myself of it. I started digging around in a lot of my quantum physics books, and in combination with reading a good deal of philosophy, I have come to the following conclusions:\n\n- 1) Our universe is indeterminate. When considering the wave-particle duality of matter, I am fairly convinced that the universe is not determinate, or at least \"nearly\" indeterminate if specific events are not possible in this universe.\n\n- 2) What do I mean by \"nearly\" indeterminate? Perhaps, specific events appear determinate due to a system in which certain events cannot occur, thus forcing a determinate solution from an indeterminate system.\n\nIf I believe that the universe is indeterminate, everything is a matter of chance. In short, *Event A probabilistically causes Event B or Event C.* However, the presence of Event C doesn't imply Event A happened. Also, the presence of Event A doesn't imply Event B or Event C will happen. Infact, there is the potential that nothing could happen if the sum of the probabilities of Events B and C doesn't equal 1.\n\nSo what does this all mean? \n\n**I believe that our universe is governed by indeterminism. This means that the future is not necessarily constrained to a single course. However, I believe that the probability of certain events occurring is zero, and thus appears to be deterministic. For example, if I throw my phone directly over my head, gravity will cause it to fall directly on my head. There is no other outcome, as the probability of gravity acting as the driving force is absolute. The event is trivial. I believe the same is true for chemical reactions, that they will behave in what appears to be a deterministic manner to do an \"absolute\" outcome. Thus, I would state that while our universe is indeterminate, we still do lack \"Free-Will\". Or, perhaps our understanding of energy and matter is wrong, and what appears indeterminate within our current understanding is determinate in a different scientific field.**\n\nPlease, provide any opinions or insight you have. I've been thinking on this topic non-stop and want to know what Reddit thinks. I understand that this topic has been discussed here, but more importantly, I am aiming to address the following in regard to my view, **\"Is it possible that we live in an indeterminate universe where events are left to chance, but we, as humans still lack Free-Will?\"**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Each \"lower\" level should be *very, very marginally* more accurate than the preceding level because it accounts for more but the differences are trivial.\n\nThe reason this is important is because you can understand humans in the same way. You can understand them as configurations of atoms, molecules, compounds, cells, or as people (i.e. collections of beliefs, goals, experiences, opinions, etc... who have agency). Again if done properly each of these methods should be accurate. \n\n[A clearer explanation of this argument can be found in this interview of one of its chief proponents](http://www.salon.com/2014/12/28/the_truth_about_free_will_does_it_actually_exist/).\n\nWhat all of this means is that free will, as an explanation for human action, is *as useful* as determinism and is *vastly more efficient* (the second of these should be obvious). \n\nThe significance of this requires another argument about truth that I can offer if you want; the TL;DR of it is that the truth value of a statement is determined by how useful it is in forming expectations about your future experiences. Free will is useful, therefore it is true.\n\nIt is also important because the belief that the universe is fully deterministic is not useful. In order to make use of this belief you would have to simulate the universe to the maximum possible level. But you cannot build a machine capable of simulating the entire universe in the universe without simplifying (or modelling). And if modelling is accepted as necessary then it just becomes a question of which level is most useful.

Energy does work, without energy, matter would not be able to complete any interactions. However, matter dictates \"how\" the response will take form. I guess in a very, very simple way, tt works like this, energy + matter = response.\n\n&gt;The structure of the matter is the \"human\" of you. What could you be, if not that?\n\nI would agree, the structure of matter is the \"human\" of us. Our bodies are composed primarily of water, yet that doesn't mean that water can do what we do. It's the compounds in our body that make us what we are, everything can trace back to matter though. But arguing that because I am human, I am different from water is also incorrect. Because we are primarily composed of water, we share similar properties, for example if a human were to interact with the nuclear process, they act as a moderator. If we were to be exposed to extreme heat, our blood would boil, as we are primarily composed of water. The connection between the two is steadfast, you are made of matter and thus behave as matter. Because you are \"human\" (a collection of matter in a specific arrangement) doesn't mean you are an exception to scientific law. Hopefully that explains it better.\n\n&gt;You could do otherwise, as you could have done otherwise the first time, but you will choose the same.\n\nNo, I am making the case that the choice would be the same because my \"choice\" is an illusion. It's pre-programmed by interactions of matter in my DNA and my brain. The fact is, given the exact genetic make-up at the exact time, my \"choice\" would be the same. Coincidentally, this is because I would not have free will, rather, matter would be interacting as scientific law dictates to \"respond\" in a certain way. I am saying that \"choice is an illusion\".\n\n&gt;Could you rephrase it? The topic is difficult enough as it is already :)\n\nMost certainly. So it seems that philosophy approaches the free-will problem from the perspective of \"Free-Will must exist because science cannot prove that it doesn't exist.\" Ironically, science has provided far more evidence supporting the case that free-will infact doesn't exist than philosophy has in regards to supporting that it does exist. \"Necessity\" isn't \"Truth\". Just because it's convenient to state that something is true doesn't mean that is the case. \n\nFor example: I could tell you that \"Water is blue.\" and you would nod your head and say, \"Yeah, sure!\" Well, no, it's not, it \"appears\" blue due to it reflecting light from the atmosphere. Coincidentally, the water is actually translucent, it's properties define how it \"appears\" or \"acts\" based on reactions with energy and matter. Assuming that \"water is blue\" because nobody has proved it wrong is false. The action should be to prove that something \"is\". Truth doesn't exist because of a lack of information, rather it is present when information acts as evidence to support that said truth.\n\nTL:DR - Philosophy can't just claim \"free-will\" exists in the face of determinism. If things are deterministic within the human body, as science has proven in the study of chemistry and neuroscience, then science has evidence supporting the claim that \"free-will\" doesn't exist. The fact of the matter is, neither necessity or convenience define \"Truth\"."}, {"id": "cng2wu7", "body": "Consider \"free will\" not as a concept that appeared out of nothing, but rather as something that exists regardless of our ideas about it: a property of certain agents to perform certain actions with certain conditions.\n\nThe *right* way to go is to see where our ideas of free will come from, study that cause, *then* describe it in detail.

I spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy, from a scientific standpoint. This past weekend, I had the wonderful privilege of going on a series of dates with a rather remarkably intelligent, and beautiful, young woman. To my surprise, after a few drinks, we were discussing very riveting topics, one of which based around **\"Free Will\"**. We both agreed that chemistry and physics define the universe around us, and since humans are made of matter, we are also governed by those scientific laws as well. If this is truly the case, humans exist in a deterministic universe where everything can be predicted, even our decisions... given enough scientific knowledge. Conclusion: \"Free-Will\" is an illusion.\n\nNow, fast-forward to two days later. I'm still thinking about the discussion and bending my mind around any way to disprove my theory scientifically. (I personally love to play Devil's Advocate to my own theories.) I haven't been able to, and actually, I've further convinced myself of it. I started digging around in a lot of my quantum physics books, and in combination with reading a good deal of philosophy, I have come to the following conclusions:\n\n- 1) Our universe is indeterminate. When considering the wave-particle duality of matter, I am fairly convinced that the universe is not determinate, or at least \"nearly\" indeterminate if specific events are not possible in this universe.\n\n- 2) What do I mean by \"nearly\" indeterminate? Perhaps, specific events appear determinate due to a system in which certain events cannot occur, thus forcing a determinate solution from an indeterminate system.\n\nIf I believe that the universe is indeterminate, everything is a matter of chance. In short, *Event A probabilistically causes Event B or Event C.* However, the presence of Event C doesn't imply Event A happened. Also, the presence of Event A doesn't imply Event B or Event C will happen. Infact, there is the potential that nothing could happen if the sum of the probabilities of Events B and C doesn't equal 1.\n\nSo what does this all mean? \n\n**I believe that our universe is governed by indeterminism. This means that the future is not necessarily constrained to a single course. However, I believe that the probability of certain events occurring is zero, and thus appears to be deterministic. For example, if I throw my phone directly over my head, gravity will cause it to fall directly on my head. There is no other outcome, as the probability of gravity acting as the driving force is absolute. The event is trivial. I believe the same is true for chemical reactions, that they will behave in what appears to be a deterministic manner to do an \"absolute\" outcome. Thus, I would state that while our universe is indeterminate, we still do lack \"Free-Will\". Or, perhaps our understanding of energy and matter is wrong, and what appears indeterminate within our current understanding is determinate in a different scientific field.**\n\nPlease, provide any opinions or insight you have.

I started digging around in a lot of my quantum physics books, and in combination with reading a good deal of philosophy, I have come to the following conclusions:\n\n- 1) Our universe is indeterminate. When considering the wave-particle duality of matter, I am fairly convinced that the universe is not determinate, or at least \"nearly\" indeterminate if specific events are not possible in this universe.\n\n- 2) What do I mean by \"nearly\" indeterminate? Perhaps, specific events appear determinate due to a system in which certain events cannot occur, thus forcing a determinate solution from an indeterminate system.\n\nIf I believe that the universe is indeterminate, everything is a matter of chance. In short, *Event A probabilistically causes Event B or Event C.* However, the presence of Event C doesn't imply Event A happened. Also, the presence of Event A doesn't imply Event B or Event C will happen. Infact, there is the potential that nothing could happen if the sum of the probabilities of Events B and C doesn't equal 1.\n\nSo what does this all mean? \n\n**I believe that our universe is governed by indeterminism. This means that the future is not necessarily constrained to a single course. However, I believe that the probability of certain events occurring is zero, and thus appears to be deterministic. For example, if I throw my phone directly over my head, gravity will cause it to fall directly on my head. There is no other outcome, as the probability of gravity acting as the driving force is absolute. The event is trivial. I believe the same is true for chemical reactions, that they will behave in what appears to be a deterministic manner to do an \"absolute\" outcome. Thus, I would state that while our universe is indeterminate, we still do lack \"Free-Will\". Or, perhaps our understanding of energy and matter is wrong, and what appears indeterminate within our current understanding is determinate in a different scientific field.**\n\nPlease, provide any opinions or insight you have. I've been thinking on this topic non-stop and want to know what Reddit thinks. I understand that this topic has been discussed here, but more importantly, I am aiming to address the following in regard to my view, **\"Is it possible that we live in an indeterminate universe where events are left to chance, but we, as humans still lack Free-Will?\"**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

(Ex. *Event A will cause Event B.*)\n\n- **Indeterminism** : No event is certain, and the entire outcome of an event is based on probability, or **chance**. (Ex. *Event A might cause Event B or Event C.*)\n\n**BACKGROUND** \n\nAfter the 18th century, most scientists agreed that the universe was deterministic, that it was governed by strict scientific laws that could be discovered and applied to determine the outcome of any event. Thus, determinism seems to challenge the possibility of free will. If one accepts determinism, then the universe, and any person in it, is governed by strict scientific laws. This means that any event, including an individual's choices could be determined based on scientific knowledge and causality, or cause-and-effect. However, advancements in quantum mechanics challenged determinism, ultimately proposing a universe that follows general scientific laws but one which does not have a predetermined future.\n\nIt was Werner Heisenberg who discovered indeterminism within the measurement of basic variables. Heisenberg's experiments and analysis showed that uncertainties always occurred when attempting to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were fundamental in the universe and are inherent mathematical properties in quantum mechanics. Voila! Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the basis for quantum tunneling and how nuclear fusion occurs in stars.\n\n**MY VIEW / PERSONAL**\n\nI am a twenty-five year old nuclear engineer, and as you probably guessed it, I work at a nuclear power plant. I spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy, from a scientific standpoint. This past weekend, I had the wonderful privilege of going on a series of dates with a rather remarkably intelligent, and beautiful, young woman. To my surprise, after a few drinks, we were discussing very riveting topics, one of which based around **\"Free Will\"**. We both agreed that chemistry and physics define the universe around us, and since humans are made of matter, we are also governed by those scientific laws as well. If this is truly the case, humans exist in a deterministic universe where everything can be predicted, even our decisions... given enough scientific knowledge. Conclusion: \"Free-Will\" is an illusion.\n\nNow, fast-forward to two days later. I'm still thinking about the discussion and bending my mind around any way to disprove my theory scientifically. (I personally love to play Devil's Advocate to my own theories.) I haven't been able to, and actually, I've further convinced myself of it. I started digging around in a lot of my quantum physics books, and in combination with reading a good deal of philosophy, I have come to the following conclusions:\n\n- 1) Our universe is indeterminate. When considering the wave-particle duality of matter, I am fairly convinced that the universe is not determinate, or at least \"nearly\" indeterminate if specific events are not possible in this universe.\n\n- 2) What do I mean by \"nearly\" indeterminate? Perhaps, specific events appear determinate due to a system in which certain events cannot occur, thus forcing a determinate solution from an indeterminate system.\n\nIf I believe that the universe is indeterminate, everything is a matter of chance. In short, *Event A probabilistically causes Event B or Event C.* However, the presence of Event C doesn't imply Event A happened. Also, the presence of Event A doesn't imply Event B or Event C will happen. Infact, there is the potential that nothing could happen if the sum of the probabilities of Events B and C doesn't equal 1.\n\nSo what does this all mean? \n\n**I believe that our universe is governed by indeterminism. This means that the future is not necessarily constrained to a single course. However, I believe that the probability of certain events occurring is zero, and thus appears to be deterministic. For example, if I throw my phone directly over my head, gravity will cause it to fall directly on my head. There is no other outcome, as the probability of gravity acting as the driving force is absolute. The event is trivial. I believe the same is true for chemical reactions, that they will behave in what appears to be a deterministic manner to do an \"absolute\" outcome. Thus, I would state that while our universe is indeterminate, we still do lack \"Free-Will\". Or, perhaps our understanding of energy and matter is wrong, and what appears indeterminate within our current understanding is determinate in a different scientific field.**\n\nPlease, provide any opinions or insight you have. I've been thinking on this topic non-stop and want to know what Reddit thinks. I understand that this topic has been discussed here, but more importantly, I am aiming to address the following in regard to my view, **\"Is it possible that we live in an indeterminate universe where events are left to chance, but we, as humans still lack Free-Will?\"**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

All thoughts just pop into consciousness, without our 'freely' willing. If a freely willed thought were a coherent concept, a basic requirement for a thought to be labeled as such would be that you're aware of the the set of thoughts available to you the moment before you think them, and then you 'choose' among them (whatever that means).

The point is that I think you may be under-estimating how many times the US and Russia were very close to nuclear strikes and counter strikes. Yet each time, neither millitary saw a need to launch a warhead. This is also relavient to the idea that the a nuclear strike won't happen again and 1945 wasn't the last time a nuclear strike will be used. Colin Powel once said that \"nuclear weapons are useless\" He makes some good points [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgjPkDug_rU) on the subject. I think many people would agree that the use of nuclear weapons in 1945 was tactically, a \"slam dunk\" so to speak. However, no other use for nuclear weapons, on par with ending WWII, has presented itself. So maybe possible that nuclear weapons lack the tactical practicality needed to ever be used again. Also, in regards to psychopaths consider Hosni Mubarak. He was the dictator in charge of Egypt until 2011. After 2 weeks, and 3 days of protests and riots, the top Egyptian generals forced him to resign. While their main goal arguably was to size power, it's possible if not reasonable to consider they were also trying to avoid a civil war. A civil war is NOTHING in comparison to a nuclear war. I believe, if all else fails, you can trust the military leadership to recognize the repercussions of entering a nuclear war (and recognize the chance for a coup) and remove the psychopath in charge/ prevent the usage of a nuclear weapon. Finally I would like to note, that while (basically for all the reasons mentioned above) I highly doubt nuclear weapons will be used offensively again, I cannot state I am 100%, completely certain they will never be used.

If the objective is capture and hold territory, you wouldn't use a nuke.\n\nThey're too damn powerful, even \"tiny\" nuclear devices obliterate most things around.  If there are assets you want to keep in tact (such is power generators, electrical grids, roads, farm fields, etc. you really don't want to use a nuke.\n\nSince that's probably going to be the majority of your strategy - either taking and holding territory, or trying capture useful assets, using nuclear weaponry is going to be a solidly dumb decision.\n\nThe only usefulness of a nuke, at least on the tactical level, is if you basically want to utterly destroy an area and render it unusable.  It's great for that.  But, you could just use a [thermobaric bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon) and achieve more or less the same result, minus the radiation...and the astronomical cost of the nuke.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not a whole lot of areas that are both useful to utterly destroy, AND compromise a strategic area.  The original idea behind tactical nukes was based around WW2-esque battles, where we would have columns of tanks and infantry meeting on a semi-open battlefield.\n\nThe nature of warfare has changed substantially since then, and weapons development has reached a point where tactical nuclear weapons just aren't a wise choice.\n\n**On a strategic level**:\n\nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nIt takes time for an ICBM to reach it's target.

We're all fucked.\n\nBut, lets say for whatever reason a nuclear power decides to nuke a non-nuclear power.\n\nAgain, we run into the problem that nukes are really only good for total destruction.  Strategically nuking a country into oblivion doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Presumably you would be waging war for, at the very least, some natural resources.  Nuking even just the population centers, is going to do a lot more harm to your efforts than simply occupying, or even just some conventional bombings.\n\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nNukes are just shitty weapons to deploy.  You can't follow up a nuclear strike with infantry or armor.\n\nYou can't \"nuke it a little\".\n\nThere are very few locations that you would actually want to nuke, as opposed to just conventionally bomb.\n\n**Conventional weaponry can do everything a nuke can do, cheaper, and without nuclear fallout.**"}, {"id": "2rfsnz", "body": "I don't know how common this opinion is but I have heard it from several people.

Tradition for nuclear weapons is so short that it doesnt even count.  The traditional logic for tactical use of nuclear weapons in WW2 ignores the strategic level message it sent to the Soviet Union.  The US knew that it was a marriage of convenience and the Japanese Empire decided extremely quickly that they would rather surrender to the United States than the Soviets due to their harsh experience losing territory and their logical fear of being conquered first by the soviets.  All of that pales in comparison to devastation of modern nuclear weapons.  The commentators have basically deconstructed the reasons for the use of nuclear weapons in combat.  However you can never rule out the need for self defense and deterrence.   The majority of the United States and their allies (UK, France, Germany, etc) reason for equipping such a large arsenal of nuclear weapons are for deterrence.  I'm not going to explain the rationale for deterrence, but its a very real military rationale and implicit in real politic.   The point is that just because you know the common actor doesn't mean you can anticipate  your opponents or your allies motivations, and more specifically their fears.  During the early 80's it was the Soviets legitimate fear of American's and specifically president Reagan's SDI initiative and provocative public talk that motivated the Soviet's final push for Arms prior to the end of the cold war.  The idea that your leaders are the sane rational actors is simply case of nationalism.   Remember, the US is the only country not to agree to the Non-First Strike policy among Nuclear Weapon Nation States.  Which is the equivalent of not agreeing to bring only red solo cups to the beer pong tournament.  It means nothing until its crucial to the final round and your out of red cups. The end scenario is simple, but the steps getting there are progressively more difficult. There can misunderstandings, confusions, and primal instincts that get in the way of logical non-use of these weapons.  IMHO in the best/worst chance for the use of nuclear weapons will occur when the strategic/tactical options are no longer as valid/logical to the actors as they are perceived by their opponents. Specifically when a state actor (could be the US, could be anyone in the future but were the closest to achieving it, believes that the retaliation for an attack warrants the response of the these weapons and no conceivable counter is offered by the attacked nation) Only then will the option be truly considered.   Example: Massive attack on nato allies using biological weapons by a nation without nuclear options........likely....since they can't develop them (Restrictions and all). But can create a biological pathogen capable of crippling global trade, etc...so never off the table.

But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.\n\nI am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.\n\nI have a few arguments to back this up.\n\n**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**\n\nI think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

It was a belief held mostly because of their lack of technology and not primarily because of religious beliefs. In fact, many early Christians believed the Earth was round before there was evidence in it. There's no stake in believing that the Earth is flat, but there is a stake in believing we are made by God, so creationists will fight viciously to make sure it still looks like it's up for debate when it's not.\n\nEvidence alone will not see the end of religion. Plenty of American Redditors will tell you that they never learned evolution in school. It will take long hard years of enforcing mandatory education of evolution and literally waiting for creationists to die out. And if creationists keep getting elected or put into positions of power (Gary Goodyear, Canadian Minister of State of Science and Technology, for example) then it will be a long and slow process, likely to take decades."}, {"id": "cng3520", "body": "A small minority I think.

So headists would state \"It turned out heads.\", hard aheadists would state \"It didn't turn out heads.\" (and it therefore follows that it has to be tails) and soft aheadists would state \"I'm unconvinced that it turned out heads.\" (but he may also be unconvinced that it turned out tails!)\n\nIn general it is sensible to default atheism to weak/soft atheism, since it is the common ground of both positions.

But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.\n\nI am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.\n\nI have a few arguments to back this up.\n\n**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**\n\nI think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.\n\nI am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.\n\nI have a few arguments to back this up.\n\n**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**\n\nI think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

However, in my previous comment, I was assuming a modern society where we actually have some kind of answer about our existence and if a completely isolated person were to look into it, they could look at the scientific evidence we have discovered so far and make a decision based on that and not automatically assume a higher powerful being must have created us because their brain just cannot come up with anything else."}, {"id": "cnfvxes", "body": "&gt;I was assuming a modern society where we actually have some kind of answer about our existence and if a completely isolated person were to look into it, they could look at the scientific evidence we have discovered so far and make a decision based on that and not automatically assume a higher powerful being must have created us because their brain just cannot come up with anything else.\n\nCan you really say that for certain, though? I mean, even with all the evidence we currently have, someone still has to believe that an immeasurable explosion came from absolutely nothing. And that the debris from said explosion drifted around until some of it created their galaxy, their solar system, their planet, a blob of goo that eventually mutated into them, and even the very thoughts in their head. All that just happened to come about due to an uncountable number of coincidences preceded by an unfathomable explosion with no witnesses or definite cause. \n\nNow, I know I'm oversimplying and mangling it slightly to make my point, but just think about the millions and millions of people out there that aren't scientifically inclined or don't have the capacity to really understand any of that. Don't you think SOMEONE would take the mental short cut and say a supreme being did it all? Hell, I know the truth, and I still sometimes have a hard time accepting that it was all by chance.\n\nPersonally, it stands to reason that some version of religion would find its way into being, and it probably wouldn't take that long. It would start the same way Mormonism did, and it'd eventually gain a following. There might even be rifts in the group that caused certain sections to break off and make their own groups with slightly different names and slightly different rules... \n\nIf OP's scenario were reality, I don't think religion would be as prevalent. But I definitely think it would exist in some form. If for no other reason than people being too lazy to learn the truth. It's not like there's any shortage of that in our world as it is (independent of religion) . "}, {"id": "cnfdfno", "body": "Money, these days, is not very real.

But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened.

People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**\n\nI think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

In other parts of the world, including other parts of New York State or the rest of the United States there are towns where the population is over 90% of a single religion. Growing up Atheist there could be seen as a negative trait and while the child isn't explicitly told they'll go to hell or whatever (usually), they can still face a stigma which causes them to rethink their life and convert into the local religion. It could be as simple as the girl or boy they like is part of that religion, and in order to have something they share in common, s/he will convert to said religion. It doesn't exactly mean they 100% \"believe\" (I haven't met any people who are 100% \"by the book\" religious) but it does make them converts to a group (religion) due to social influence. \n\nI believe there are times where the presence of religion has hurt humanity as a whole, but I also know that there are genuinely good religious people out there, who actively try to help others because of their teachings. I'm not sure if I'm willing to take that away from them, ever. \n\nAlso to note OP; my mom is Catholic and my father is Shinto-Buddhist. I learned OF Hell from TV shows and other influences. I've never once in my life feared it. I personally cannot make the connection of having a magical part of me that leaves my body and transports itself to another dimension when I die, wherein some entity judges my actions in my non-spirit life and determines that based on ~80 years as a corporal being, I am now destined for an eternity of damnation (or tranquility). Seems a bit drastic. Especially since the Judge, Jury, and Prosecutor is said to have created me and set me on an unchangeable path. \n\nThe best part of Religion is helping those less fortunate than you. If you need a god to tell you to do that, it's much better than nobody ever telling you. \n\n(that was kind of a rant that didn't pertain to OPs original statement, I'm in agreement with his logic that if you never heard of religion, there wouldn't be religion, since logically it makes sense.

But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.\n\nI am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.\n\nI have a few arguments to back this up.\n\n**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**\n\nI think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.\n\nI am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.\n\nI have a few arguments to back this up.\n\n**1.

Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting.

I was raised roman catholic, though not very strict or intense. I lost my faith into christianity aged around 13 or so. I considered myself an atheist well into my 20s, but after some years I felt a nagging that I wanted to explore. I felt that there were things missing in my view of the world. I started to look at several religions, tried out things, even \"interviewed\" friends and strangers of different faiths until I found the one that clicked with me. The one where I very quickly felt at home, welcomed and fulfilled. And it's not like I believe everything this religion (or it's people) says and follow everything blindly, I am still very critical and often argue / discuss with others about the finer details! \n\nSo yeah, I did what you described.
