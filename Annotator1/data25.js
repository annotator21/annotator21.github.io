However, it's widely known and accepted that sexual relations are directly related to childbirth, and as such, males are at least partially responsible for the result, whether that be a child or not.\n\nMy point is that financial and parental responsibilities have to be separated from the procedure of abortion, due to the medical and personal nature of the procedure."}, {"id": "2qy21w", "body": "First of all, I understand the underlying arguments for women being the sole decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion.

It could just as easily drive people back towards baseball which is heavily dominated by Hispanic players. Many asian immigrants haven't shown a strong predilection towards soccer and they're the big immigrant populations in the west if I'm not mistaken. Maybe Koreans.\n\nAnd people acclimate to their new countries too. They put their kids in the locally popular sports. They want to belong with their peers. We're seeing more and more african-canadian NHL players. I think that's one of the reasons. Caribbean immigrants in cities like Toronto and Montreal see how popular hockey is, they grow up in environments where that sport is king, and then when it comes time to place their often Canadian-born children in sports they pick that.

But this only works because of a weird system MLS has set up. \n\n&gt; Epl salaries average 1.6 million pounds, about ten fold higher than mls at 200k dollars. \n\nThis is definitely true.  But MLS enforces a salary cap at $3.1million-- however each team is allowed to exempt 3 players from that total, and the exempted players are often European players who are getting offered a salary competitive to what their clubs at home would offer.  \n\nThat is how the average can be so low, while still being able to offer competitive salaries.\n\nSo yes, the average is most certainly behind most of the world.  But that gap has been narrowing from the beginning, the salary cap continues to rise as viewership and attendance continues to increase.  \n\nAnd I'm just trying to convince OP that soccer WILL be in the top 3 US sports some day, I'm not arguing that it currently is.  \n\n&gt;Also the astros still had higher attendance than the dynaml by a few hundred peopld last season.\n\nExactly, barely higher attendance.  But while the Astros averaged filling their stadium to a mere [52% of capacity](http://espn.go.com/mlb/attendance), Dynamo's average stadium fill was [91%](http://mlsattendance.blogspot.com).   \n\nAnd as you can also see from these figures, more than half of MLB teams average attendance is below 75% of stadiums' capacity, where NO MLS team had an average in that range.  \n\nLet's look at Kansas city instead of Houston.  The Royals just had one of their best years in 3 decades--they averaged 24,000 for attendance, and basically never sold out.  Sporting KC had a so-so year, but averaged 20,000 in attendance and has now sold out 53 consecutive home games.  Now that's pretty good for a stadium that was recently built and a team that hasn't been around nearly as long.  \n\nAnyways, that is all just to say that while soccer continues to expand, baseball does not.

[This will have to do.](http://www.rgj.com/story/sports/2014/07/12/murray-past-present-future-americas-popular-sports/12587687/) )\n\n\nFast forward to today. The NFL is a behemoth, but is losing support among parents. The MLB has had ratings issues since 1994, and has no presence in the inner cities anymore. Each year we see record lows in ratings for the World Series. The NBA has exploded in the past 25 years, especially overseas. The NHL has a committed following, though attendance is on par with the MLS, and TV ratings aren't all that great. Boxing and Horse Racing are almost completely irrelevant.\n\nAll this serves to show that the popularity of sports in America is extremely fluid. It would be of surprise to very few if in 30 years the MLB is barely relevant, and soccer is toe to toe with American football.

It states that from when the first \"Boston rules\" game was held in the mid-to-late 1800s until the Great Depression, soccer was considered to be the second-most popular sport behind baseball in the US. If it did it once, it could do it again. You must remember that the MLS is a young league, and progress will be made. There will be growing pains similar to the flash-in-the-pan leagues of the 70s and 80s, but as the American soccer pyramid gains more structure, the sport will gain more traction. And it's not like we're bad at the sport either. Our men's team is in the top 30 according to the FIFA World Rankings, and our women's team is number one with a whopping two World Cup stars above their crest. Viewership of seven USA games during this past World Cup each was more than that of the final game of the World Series. As the NASL and USL PRO gain traction as well, we grow ever closer to a promotion/relegation system such as the one used in virtually every other league in the world, something I personally find essential to growth of the sport here in the states. I'm not going to say that this will happen soon. There are many things that need to be changed about our system, and the MLS might not even survive to be the league that leads soccer to big-name status. With all these new additions, the MLS may go down the path of many former leagues here and overexpand. But these are the growing pains that all organizations face in the early days. My friend, you may think that soccer doesn't have the power to become a major sport, even in its current stage of popularity. By looking at the overwhelming data that suggests the rapidly growing play, viewership, and enjoyment of the sport by the population, I personally must disagree. As long as the US soccer pyramid is managed correctly, and the sport is given the proper conditions that it requires to flourish, soccer will have no problem growing. The current generation have found a new love for the sport, with over 3 million registered players in the US Youth Soccer system in 2012, as opposed to just over a million in 1985. Mind you, that is only one of the many soccer organizations in the US, and the countless unregistered children who play the Beautiful Game on their own. With this brand-new batch of players growing up with the sport and passing it down to their children, soccer in the US only has one way to go: forwards.\n\nTL;DR: Soccer will grow.

Are they all superstars like LBJ?  No, but they all play in the NBA, in fact most of them have been All Stars.  Derrick Rose has been a league MVP.

The NBA and MLB are made up of many non-American players though, and they do participate both aforementioned international tournaments.  Dirk Nowitzki, Manu Ginobili, Pau Gasol, these guys are high profile players.

In fact... I'm a little surprised to see baseball up there, do people really pay that much attention anymore?  I guess it's a regional thing but still I mostly see empty stadiums when I catch a glimpse on TV, and I don't know anyone personally who pays attention to baseball (and I know A LOT of sports fans).  \n\nI don't think that soccer will beat football or basketball in the \"near\" future, but I think it's well on it's way to knocking baseball down to LaCrosse and Rugby status.  \n\nBaseball is dying, and for a good reason.  Slow pace, unpredictable length of matches, too many god damn statistics, and few people outside of a few countries really care.  First soccer, is ALREADY more popular in younger generations, and that trend is increasingly true.  That can only mean as the population ages that soccer has nowhere to go but up.  \n\nAlso keep in mind, that almost EVERY immigrant is a fan of soccer if nothing else and that is a HUGE portion of our population that is consistently added, that is also consistently and overwhelming made up of people who pay attention to soccer above all other sports.  \n\nSoccer can make you a super star in a way that basketball and football simply can't, and as people come to realize that (and MLS continues to be increasingly competitive in salary offerings), the talent will come.  Everyone in the world who pays attention to soccer knows who Messi is.  That's BILLIONS of people know who Messi is, or Pele, or Ronaldo and on and on.  There is no NFL player with that kind of name recognition.  The World Cup viewership makes the Super Bowl look like a high school homecoming.  \n\nIn the distant future I see there being a \"Big 2.\"  Basketball and Soccer.  Basketball being a sport that is becoming increasingly popular all over the world, which will only ultimately increase its popularity here in the US, and soccer.  American football I expect to continue to be a sport specific to the US, where it will remain popular if for no other reason than to be patriotic; the Superbowl for example is going to remain somewhat of a 'tradition' for a lot of people for a long time.  I also expect that in time (40-50 years) that football with be considered a decidedly southern sport.  But I don't think it will in the long run have the same appeal that two sports like soccer and basketball, where the action doesn't stop constantly and where you can learn the gist of the game and how to score in 10 seconds.  They're also both sports that are relatively easy to play with weird numbers of people, and in weird adapted places, with hardly any equipment.  You also can't play football in the olympics or in any major world tournament.  \n\nAnd finally, as soccer attracts more and more of our gifted athletes, we will start to be increasingly competitive on the world stage.  We have a bigger talent pool than Brazil for example, and it is only a matter of time before those games start to be really entertaining.  This will do even more to attract viewership.  \n\nTL;DR In the very near future, soccer will certainly beat out baseball in popularity.  In the distant future, I see basketball and soccer attracting the largest nationwide followings, with the NFL eventually becoming a more regional (southern) thing-- similar to hockey in the north, but still very popular.

Prostitution encounters many of the problems you cite- extortion, oppression, female objectification- so would it be morally preferable to go to a prostitute, but run away before paying? In order to argue yes, we would need to focus on the idea that by not being payed, the prostitute would in time be able to leave the industry. Not only is this rather naive, but it places all the moral importance on the presence or absence of a transaction, deliberately ignoring the moral position of the payer/stealer. \n\nThe fact that the moral preference is reliant on 'all those who pay should stop' is demonstrative of how convoluted the idea is. It ignores the possibility of sex positive, affirmative pornography, and places it's moral question in the hands of a fanciful porn-less future. \n\nWhy not watch amateur, or specifically affirmative porn based around, where it is clearer that the women involved are making a free choice? If you only want to watch the mainstream, big business stuff, that's rather a telling sign of the way your 'morally preferable' system won't hold up. \n\nTake this alternative- society shuns the qualms and embarrassments around sex. People are open about porn habits, and the industry becomes a regulated, safe industry supported by customer money.

You say they are \"objectified, exposed to health risk and whatever other negative effects come from getting boned on camera for money\".  \n\nNow I would point out that the 'health risk' or doing porn is pretty minimal.  Porn actors get extensive STD tests every two weeks, and sometimes also a few days before a shoot.  Sex on a porn set is among the safest (by STD risk) sex there is.\n\nNow you say the actors are 'objectified'.  That's a bit harder to define, especially since some porn does this more than others.  However I would argue that 1. whatever objectification does happen isn't bad enough to dismantle an entire industry over, and 2. there are plenty of other industries that objectify women just as badly if not worse (such as the fashion industry).  \n\nI also think you have a messed up view of how porn stars live.  Quoting one of your comment replies:\n\n&gt; I don't want to support the porn industry, something that just creates opportunities for people to have shitty lives\n\nWe've had several porn stars do AMAs, I'd encourage you to ask any of them if they consider their lives shitty because of porn.  I think most would say they do not consider their lives 'shitty' and are happy for the opportunity to make so much money doing something they enjoy.\n\nBut then in the same comment you reveal your arrogant, unrealistic view of the world:\n\n&gt; If having someone jizz in your mouth is your passion in life, you shouldn't need to get paid for it, I wish blowing dudes was what made me happy in life, there would be an endless see of people lining up help me with that, I wouldn't need to get paid, I could just travel the world and suck guys off, that's a lot less easier than having a career and shit.\n\nYou forget that IT TAKES MONEY TO LIVE.  So if you are going to 'travel the world and suck guys off', but not get paid, who is going to pay for your hotel room?  How about your medical care?  Do you STD-screen the dudes you suck off?  That costs money.\n\nBesides, while most porn stars have above-average sex drive, most aren't THAT horny that they're going to quit a day job and travel the country to suck guys off.  So having a reputable, regulated porn industry provides such people the OPPORTUNITY to exercise their sexuality in a safe, financially productive environment.\n\nThe bottom line- what you must wrap your head around is just because YOU consider a particular life or lifestyle to be shitty or undesirable doesn't mean someone else will agree with your judgment.

The formation of sovereign bodies has hitherto been performed through hierarchical striation along the boundaries of class dictatorships. States serve the good of those bodies that constitute the formative kingmaker class of society that can constitute itself as dictator. They do not serve everyone. This is evidenced in a myriad of ways, but since we're arguing on the internet, I figure I might as well drop the classic example of the Holocaust, wherein the state was willing to serve the general welfare of all people only inasmuch as 11+ millions of people were considered to be not people.\n\nThe state most certainly does not have a monopoly on force. In democratic countries, the sovereign of the state is the people. If the people think they are ill-governed, the people can change the government. If the government will not change then revolution is the only recourse. Many governments have been overturned through violent revolutions. Recent studies have even suggested that all it takes is 3.5% of a population to overturn a government.\n\nhttp://rationalinsurgent.com/2013/11/04/my-talk-at-tedxboulder-civil-resistance-and-the-3-5-rule/\n\n&gt;Wrong. It is not in the interest of women seeking abortions. Inasmuch as the state has a duty to prevent underpopulation, it is not best resolved by abortion. Further, there is no evidence that this will affect billions of people.\n\nIt would be in the long term interest of women seeking abortions. I am now persuaded that it would not be best resolved by prohibition, however there is good evidence that a lack of laborers will lead to an economic recession or depression, and such a depression will definitely effect billions as Japan is the third largest economy in the world.\n\n&gt;Cereal is sold at grocery stores. Milk is sold at grocery stores, too. Grocery stores employ workers. Let's say we have ten workers who work at a grocery store that exclusively sells cereal and milk. Let's also say that this grocery store is a monopoly and therefore its sales are representative of aggregate demand for both milk and cereal in the economy where it resides. All ten of these workers handle both cereal and milk in their occupational duties. If the store were to stop selling cereal because of a government decree that cereal is causing a dangerously negative birth rate, but were to continue selling milk, the store would still be representative of the aggregate demand for milk. The workers, formerly charged with sale of both milk and cereal, now will be charged solely with the sale of milk. However, this store represents the aggregate demand. They can try to substitute milk for cereal to some extent by diverting productive resources for the sale of cereal to the sale of milk, but this effectively will serve the purpose of shifting the price of milk downwards along the demand curve while not substantially recovering the sales normally allocated to cereal. The marginal rate of substitution for milk and cereal, you see, is not perfect. To some extent, substitution falls flat. So, even though the store still sells milk, and its workers are perfectly trained and capable of selling milk, approximately half of the workers will be laid off. Abortion is cereal. Other procedures are milk. It might not be half, but to disregard potential economic effects on the basis that health care professionals have more than one function is irresponsible\n\nI suppose it would be negligent to disregard potential economic effects of outlawing abortion. However I'm not convinced that the economic ramifications would outweigh the benefits of adding another 200,000 - 300,000 people into the economy.\n\n&gt;Women make up (more than) half the labor force and spend their wages as (more than) half of the consumer base. There is the potential for the economy to be cut in half in a few short years.\n\nI'm afraid I'm not convinced that out of 60 million women, a couple hundred thousand of them putting their careers on hold would cut the economy in half.\n\n&gt;Who are you to purpose your thought as law of nature? I'll again ask why should I care what you think? I don't see any conceivable reason in the absence of all evidence, that I am making an overestimation. From this section of the response, you also ignore the potential impacts of women made infertile, dead, or prisoner by proposed measures for criminalization of abortion.\n\nI believe you are the one who is trying to persuade me. If you don't care what I think then why are you putting so much effort into persuasion?\n\n&gt;This is self-contradicting. It either works, doesn't work, or is inconclusive. These classifications don't overlap. What's more, if a criminalization of abortion were put into effect, the same claim could be used to unilaterally dismiss it. You lack a metric by which to evaluate the efficacy of methods but insist on the superiority of your own proposition on grounds of blind faith.\n\nI believe that this trichotomy is really a spectrum of certainty. A point has a level of certainty which changes continuously with new information arriving. \n\n&gt;I'll top this off with one new argument to keep things fresh: immigration policy reform stands a far greater chance at increasing the Japanese population than criminalized abortion.\n\nI'm afraid I have already awarded a delta for this good point.\n\nps: you really ought to take a course on Aristotelian rhetoric. The way you debate is quite combative and is not conducive to persuading anyone. Persuasion is really an art which comprises compelling points, interesting illustrations, inspiring dialogue, and friendly prodding among other things."}, {"id": "cnaad40", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cnaqfb8", "body": "Your interest may be in economic ramifications.

For various reasons, hormonal birth control has failed to gain social acceptance and there's a *lot* of misinformation about other forms of birth control.  Sex ed in Japan is pretty bad... a scary number of adult women don't really understand how sex or pregnancy work.  And of course the \"ideal\" for women is purity and innocence.\n\nIs it really a surprise that people (especially young women) have negative ideas about sex when they think of it as something that's scary, something that's taboo, something that belongs to men, something that has dire consequences?  If Japanese politicians were serious about increasing the birth rate, they'd be promoting better sex education and encouraging women to take ownership of their sexuality (which means having real control over fertility).  They'd be promoting social programs to change the prevailing idea that a woman should quit her job after her first pregnancy and sequester herself away as a housewife for the rest of her life.  Japanese culture is very socially conservative when it comes to sex and gender roles, so *not* having sex and *not* having relationships are ways for women to avoid those dated expectations.\n\nSex ed for boys is pretty awful, too.  Too many guys have the idea that sex is some kind of tit-for-tat \"insert money, receive girlfriend\" kind of thing.  They don't know how to have healthy sexual relationships.  They want girls who conform to old-fashioned gender roles, and they want to be the \"provider\" in the relationship, but they know that with the state of the economy as it is that they're less likely to find stable employment.  Avoiding sex allows men to avoid the shame of not living up to traditional masculine expectations.\n\nSo the issue is a whole lot deeper than abortion.

If all of these unwanted fetuses were born, the retrogression will certainly pull back thus possibly saving the country if not at least giving them more time to find a solution.\n\nI'm most certainly not married to this idea, and I would be glad to have my view changed.\n\n1 http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/22/japans-sexual-apathy-is-endangering-the-global-economy/?tid=pm_world_pop\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
