Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them.

I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school.

I think you must be defining religion as the practices and expressions themselves. Am I right?

It's mildly relevant.\n\nExpanding on that, and more appropriate to your comment, I'd add that it's one thing to convince a single fool, but an entirely different matter to convince a society made up of more than fools. For that to be possible, you'd have to start with a society that definitely believed in the supernatural, strongly enough that they're at the point where they are actually willing to do things out of fear or reverence or worship, etc. The con man would then be trying to subvert those beliefs to his own purposes, (which is where your definition jumps in) but that's an entirely different matter that doesn't describe how people ended up with such sincere beliefs, which is what I was trying to address in my first comment.

The closest thing she had to a religion was Daoism which, as you may know, isn't remotely monotheistic. In fact, the way it's \"practiced\" by most Chinese, is more in culture than actual belief. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Prior to moving to the US, the idea of a **single**, **omnipotent**, **omniscient**, **humanoid** being who created all of existence and who is, in a way, in control of every aspect of everyone's lives was absurd to her. \n\nHer life went pretty well in the US without being religious or spiritual in the least. But, and these are her words, she felt as though there was something missing in her life despite decent financial and personal success. It led her to seek out religion and now she is a devout, practicing Christian. \n\nNow, I am agnostic. With that being said, I wouldn't argue that religion fills a hole that is, for many people, otherwise unfillable. Religion gives people answers to questions and comfort in a way that, unfortunately, I don't think science ever will. Science is a great way of explaining phenomena in a factual manner but struggles to answer the \"Why.\" For some people, a \"why\" gives them a sense of purpose or meaning in life that nothing else apparently can (whether or not that answer is truthful is a whole other debate). I've seen people find relief in religion through every imaginable problem, from relationship issues to drug addiction. \n\nOrganized religion, especially Christianity (based on my experiences),  also fills a social function. There are plenty of people who participate in religion because it is an opportunity to meet new people and discuss a wide, wide variety of topics. \n\n&gt; 1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.\n\nThis doesn't explain converts. \n\n&gt; 2.

However, sociologists who study religion note that rave culture, such as Burning Man, include all the elements of religion and it's adherents talk about the religious nature of the rave experience. The same is true of followers of jam bands. The more sociologist study the behavioral elements of religious expression, the more they see religion in what would not normally be considered religious events if one holds to the preconception that religion must be about beliefs in higher powers. \n\nA sociological and anthropological standard is that a sociological construct is what it's participants claim it is. When guys who spend their lives building cars say that the race track is their cathedral, then sociologists need to take it seriously and examine the race track in terms of it's religious importance. \n\nThis is why many sociologists are starting to discount the idea that religion is really a stand alone category.

I know many people (hundreds, personally) that have abandoned traditional religious structures like Christianity, etc., in favor of this kind of neo-pagan religious community. This really can't be explained by your simplistic \"their parents taught them this\" view of how religious thought arises and persists. \n\nYou're most likely correct that people wouldn't believe in the specific religions they believe in if they weren't indoctrinated. But we have lots of evidence that that doesn't stop them from inventing new craziness to believe in. There are probably a few \"archetypes\" that would reoccur, like the notion of some being that created the universe, because these fill a need for people to see purpose in life without having to make it themselves (people are lazy that way, and other simply don't trust themselves to be creators of meaning). \n\nBut even aside from traditionally religious areas, people seem to have a natural tendency for making up wacky explanations for things even in the face of evidence that somehow satisfy some kind of need for them. \n\nWe have people that believe that homeopathic medicine is more than water.

I wouldn't expect anyone to accept such a profound shift in reality over a few words of a stranger or a few minutes of 'thinking about it'.\n\nIf however, a child is never introduced to the idea of a God in the first place and his 'default' reality does not include a God, then no I do not think it would be easy to convince him of God's existence in the absence of evidence, as a matured, well educated adult.

Assuming atheism is correct, if they weren't, it would be increasingly more difficult for religion to have ever taken hold or spread. The fact that it even exists indicates you could be wrong. Beyond that, people routinely believe in all sorts of things that are discredited massively, and it often has nothing to do with culture or a household. Things like ghosts, spirits, karma, infomercials, homeopathy, herbal cures to serious illnesses (while rejecting modern medicine), conspiracy theories to a fault, sensations of fate, soothsaying, etc.\n\nWhat's really going on is that there is a class of people who are insecure about themselves, because they're generally near average. They aren't the football star, and they're not going to Princeton. People in that boat need to accept their condition and move on or play the blame game. They aren't going to Princeton, because they \"aren't trying\". They just don't read/study, but they're geniuses for sure. They then fall into the insufferable attitude of a child where they feel the need to vocalize anything they think they know pretentiously when someone else doesn't know it. \"I think Washington DC is roughly 340 miles from here.\" The child: \"You mean 260 right? Sheesh, everyone knows that.\"\n\nCould you imagine if people posted so vehemently about the topic of modern medication - if they posted videos and pictures of people ignorant of infection mishandling dangerous bodily fluids *in jest*. \"Those fucking idiots, if only they knew about this scientific fact I know about.\" It starts to sound like the child, right? Of course, that comes off as psychotic or at least mentally unhealthy to laugh at the misfortune of the uneducated. Still, children get like that, because they have fragile egos and haven't learned to socialize effectively yet. The loser gets like this, because he still has a fragile ego and has only learned how to socialize poorly and to be resentful of what he lacks rather than being realistic.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is the person who constantly announces his atheism and constantly announces how wrong religion is. Fix your insecurity. I hope you see the parallel between laughing at or cruelly criticizing (to an oddly severe extent) tribesmen for not understanding modern medicine and doing the same to people who are more faithful than you are.

Religion provides easy to understand, satisfying explanations to these questions.\n\n2: People are driven by a strong survival instinct, which results in a fear of dying. If suddenly there was a way to believe that death isn't really death, that would certainly make you less fearful and make you feel better.\n\nNow obviously these days we have advanced physics and other sciences to explain, but for anyone who isn't willing to dedicate large amounts of time to understanding this (or is simply too stupid) this won't be as satisfying of an explanation. Also, pretty much all scientific evidence is that there is no afterlife (for example measuring if anything \"left\" the body at the moment of death to confirm a soul), which is a pretty tough pill to swallow for most, even more so right after they lost a loved one.\n\nAs for WHAT religion people choose, that is indeed mostly culture, the need to believe in something comforting is one thing. However Allah is no more likely to exist than Zeus or Odin or an immortal dragon turtle. So whenever people associate themselves with a SPECIFIC religion, that is usually influence from the area or people around them, whether it be that the only churches nearby are Christian or simply because the rest of your family is.\n\nThere are billions of reasons why people may start to believe, but as far as I know it all ultimately results from the two points I listed. Whether it's indoctrination, the inability cope with some emotional trauma, a charismatic priest, a heavy hallucination caused by drugs (yes it happens) or a near death experience, all of it, ultimately, is because it gives the person in question a sense of comfort.\n\nThis can also be used to explain [the statistic](http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_poll3.htm) that more Christians believe in heaven than in hell for example. Or why most Christians you meet (I'm using Christians as an example because I assume that's the major religious demographic near you) believe that God is watching over the, but don't do everything they can to avoid the seven deadly sins.\n\n"}, {"id": "2rfea1", "body": "_____\n\nI'll give you an example:\n\n\nLet's say a person is completly isolated from religion, - it still exists, but he doesn't know that, nobody ever says anything about religion while near him, and he simply cannot see churches and other religious structures (suck it, this is just a made up story, you got my point).\nThe word \"religion\" is unknown to him and he doesn't know a single bit about religion.\n\nThis person goes through education just like any normal kid, but he is not taught of religion.\nWhen he finishes college, somebody shows him this whole concept of \"religion\", the churches, the ritual, the culture..

And again if asked at least a few will tell you they don't believe in God. \n\nReligion, like all aspects of culture, is actually enormously complex and while you are correct that it is very tightly tied to culture, the notion that people are one thing or another is really only true in a very limited way. The vast majority of the world are quite pluralistic about religion -- mixing praxis and beliefs and ceremony from a multitude of global and regional religions into their own particular cultural expression.  \n\nIt is primarily in the wealthier nations where you see rigid segregation of religions into named denominations. However, even in this context, you still have Christians who will state outright  that they don't believe God exist, or practice Buddhist meditation, or engage in some Wiccan ritual, and so on. \n\nAnd that doesn't even get into the question of considering, say, Christianity, as a monolithic set of beliefs. The number of people who are raised in one denomination who end up in one quite different in both praxis and doctrine from the denomination of their parents is huge. \n\n**edit** As an example of how people create religion: if you look at raves, you will find that they can be studied with the same tools one uses to study sociology of religion.

Yet, I believe.  Go figure."}, {"id": "2rfea1", "body": "_____\n\nI'll give you an example:\n\n\nLet's say a person is completly isolated from religion, - it still exists, but he doesn't know that, nobody ever says anything about religion while near him, and he simply cannot see churches and other religious structures (suck it, this is just a made up story, you got my point).\nThe word \"religion\" is unknown to him and he doesn't know a single bit about religion.\n\nThis person goes through education just like any normal kid, but he is not taught of religion.\nWhen he finishes college, somebody shows him this whole concept of \"religion\", the churches, the ritual, the culture.. But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.\n\nI am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.\n\nI have a few arguments to back this up.\n\n**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**\n\nI think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

Religion, for better or worse, has delivered the principles and doctrines that have shaped education systems, early scientific discoveries, laws and morales across the world. I'm not saying these could not have developed without religion, but I think there is a strong case to argue that religion is so engrained in the history of everything we know today that it cannot be separated. At worst, it very heavily affected the psychology of individuals who were influential across history. \n\nSo, if you totally remove the influence of religion at a young age, you need to remove almost everything. Looking at the earliest civilisations, Sumer and Ancient Egypt had an incredibly strong religious influence. So even though I have nothing to support this, can we even argue that effective civilisations could exist without religion? \n\nI guess what I am saying is that it is only through religion that we obtained the level of advancement and intelligence to reject religion.

Religion may or may not be bad, and may or may not be correct (there are so many things that fall under the broad category of \"religion\" that it'd be ridiculous to say that *all* of them are bad and incorrect). But if a religious belief is bad or incorrect, it is not simply the fact that it's socially constructed that makes it so.\n\nPlenty of things are socially constructed. For example, you seem to believe that it's important to have beliefs that are in accordance with reality. That belief itself is socially constructed. If you grew up surrounded by people who thought that it was only important to have beliefs that make you feel good, you would likely believe the same. So I could say \"the only reason FearlessClone desires truthyness is that it was forced into his brain as a child\". But does that make your desire for truthyness bad?\n\nSo if you want to argue that religion is bad, then 1) pick a particular religious belief, because \"religion\" is way too broad, and then 2) tell us why it's bad, without talking about why people believe it. If you pick \"the gays are all going to hell\" for #1, and \"because, well, duh\" for #2, you'll find a lot fewer people to disagree with.

To say brainwash, it implies \"systematic &amp; often forcible pressure.\" I do not know many people who use scare tactics to get their kids to be a part of their faith. I do know of some who teach what they truly believe which also means a possible eternity of hell. Although I do not agree with what they teach, I see no problem in them teaching it. We are allowed to share whatever we want. We do not have an obligation to share only things that can be \"proven\" by a school of thought. That applies to any school of thought.\n\nAlthough parents shape out perspective, so does the rest of our culture. The music you listen to, the movies you watch, the friends you value (which also have a slightly different cultural perspective), the teachers you admire, etc. You also cannot ignore the fact that we have our own thoughts that will be against our parents and our teachers and no one can take that away from us. We impact our worldview and our culture as much as it impacts us. It is hard to blame one particular group for a thought continuing through generations.\n\nI do admit, sadly, that many people, if not most, are \"indoctrinated\" into their beliefs (taught a belief system uncritically). They never challenge what they are taught or critically work through their faith. And I would say that is very wrong. No one should believe anything that matters to them without critically reviewing it and continuing to think about what they think and why they think it.\n\nI would venture to say the main problem people have with religion is not the small population of outliers that \"brainwash\" their children or young believers (even thought who have faith do not like this) but rather people with faith not being critical about their faith. I have no idea what your view is or what your life experiences have been but I do know, from my our life experiences mind you, that faith systems are too vast to be boiled down to anything other than the core values. Especially a large one, will have many interpretations and ways to understand those core values.\n\nI have met very few people who have a problem with what I believe after they get to know me. I have met plenty of people who judge and assume my beliefs when they hear I am a Christian. People make assumptions all of the time but they know very little and assume what they believe to assume. They clump people together because it's easy. I have even heard people say things like \"I hate Christians, but not you, because Christians blah blah blah.\" What they do not realize is I am not very different than most other Christians. The problem is, our current 1st world cultures, specifically that of the United States &amp; Canada, we focus on the negatives and extremes. We do not care that Islam is a huge faith system all across the world. We do not care that is fairly peaceful. We care that there are extremists that we have as a \"terrorist enemy.\" We do not care that many/most Christians I know do very good charitable work or that there are many Christians preaching equality, acceptance &amp; love. We care that there are extreme groups claiming to be Christians that do horrible things. We care about those Christians protesting in the streets about \"gays going to hell\" &amp; \"abortion is murder.\" That is not the majority. \n\n\n**Tl;DR**\n       Do not be naive enough to think that people follow faith strictly because of brainwashing. Or to think that all people find faith through fear. Many people do spend a lot of time sincerely searching for faith. And even if only a few find faith through a searching without pressures then it must be something more than brainwashing or being forced.\n\n\nIf you care to read a little of my experience:\n\nI'm a Christian &amp; despite my family saying they raised me as a Christian, they did not. I never saw my family pray, except sometimes before meals. I never saw my family go to church (although my mother would take me to church on some holidays). I never believed any of the things that I was told as a child about religion. I did not know if there was a God. So despite my family saying they raised me with a Christian worldview, I would disagree. I was never feared into putting faith in a God that would punish me in fire and suffering. I was never guilted into following a faith system due to anything. I was given the choice to look up and believe whatever I wanted. My family had many friends with many different religious backgrounds who shared with me and expressed their beliefs.\n\nI did, however, spend some time as a teen looking up the \"major\" religions; Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism. I'd be a liar if I said I remember much about any of them aside from the first three, with a major focus on Judaism &amp; Christianity (which is mainly due to my college education focus). \n\nI came to have a faith in Jesus Christ after I tried committing suicide and in a fit of rage/brutal honesty, I was screaming in my house alone speaking all the thoughts I had in my head. The only way I could explain what had happened was something outside of my understanding. I had an \"experience\" with God. That is the first time I would ever say that I had a faith in something. \n\nIt's easy to dismiss something like a faith system if you up hold it to the limits of science. The problem with this is science is always changing and has always been changing. The two perspectives are not mutually exclusive nor are they contradictory. They do co-exist and they should. But I fear I may be getting a little off topic.\n\nCulture is a complex entity. There are many moving parts. Faith is one of those parts. As is anything else really. It all comes with its positives and its negatives.

It has been argued elsewhere in this thread that these people would not have converted if society as a whole were not comfortable and familiar with religion. But this cannot be considered a necessary condition in their decision to convert. If we took away the mainstream nature of religion in society, there would always still be converts. This is because the OP's claim only makes sense *if we assume that everyone in the world ultimately follows what is mainstream* i.e. that it would be impossible for someone to embrace religiosity if society-at-large wasn't already familiar and comfortable with it.\n\nBut this is clearly not the case. If atheism were the dominant, mainstream view across the world and children were all being raised without exposure to religion, *some would still end up turning to religious belief*.

There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\nPeople absolutely change religions when they're older. It happens all the time. That alone should make you rethink your view.\n\nBut specific religions aside, people often seek religion for various reasons. I would say that the most common reasons I hear from people who came to religion after being not religious are hope, acceptance, and purpose. \n\nWhen you're sitting at your computer, with a roof over your head, some sort of financial support, just chilling out and relaxing, it's easy to think \"Man, life is good, everything I want I have been able to obtain for myself.\" \n\nBut when you're barely scraping by, and there's an ongoing illness that's making the medical bills pile up, and you're not sure where the next mortgage payment is coming from, and you don't know what you'll be eating tomorrow, if you're going to eat at all, it's a lot harder to not think or hope that there's some sort of higher power at work, and then to try to counter that by seeking another higher power. When you're desperate, you think about things in a totally different way.\n\nHope is just one part. Acceptance is another. And I know that someone will likely say \"Well Christians hate gays, that's not accepting\" in response to this. That's just not the case. Many, many churches and Christian organizations - I'd wager that a majority - are at the very least accepting of gays, even if they won't perform a gay wedding. They will be treated basically the same as everyone else in the church, and even be encouraged to participate in most activities. \n\nMoving on from gays, though - There's an incredible Christian group called Teen Challenge that helps recovering drug addicts get out of a life of crime, overcome their addictions, and move on with life. If that's not an honorable goal, I don't know what is. Drugs ruin lives in a way few other things can. And many of the people in there seek that group out because they know they'll have a support group and have some sort of hope coming out of it, and their background doesn't matter.\n\nFinally, purpose. Again, some people seek out religion because they're looking to have a purpose or goal in life. Their life is fine on the surface, but they still feel empty or like they're missing something. They seek out some sort of fulfillment.\n\n\n**TLDR: People independently seek out religion for a variety of purposes.

"}, {"id": "cnfy8ut", "body": "During my first couple years of undergrad, I noticed a very distinct difference in drinking patterns between first-year students (mostly underage, drinking age is 19 here) and upper-year students (mostly legal).  There were three main differences:\n\n1. Upper-years were much more likely to drink at bars or clubs, and would tend to drink less there than they would elsewhere.\n2. First-years would drink any time they got the chance, while upper-years would drink when they felt like it.\n3. When first-years acquired alcohol they would drink all of it almost immediately, while upper-years were much more likely to keep a small liquor cabinet.\n\nAll of these things are affected by the drinking age.  People who can legally drink can more easily go to bars/clubs/etc. and people who can't.  Drinking at a bar or club is vastly more expensive than at home (which may reduce binge drinking), drinks are more standard (it's a lot easier to count drinks than guesstimate how much your friend drunkenly poured for you), bartenders act as moderators (for both liability and venue reasons, there's a limit to how drunk they can let you get), all staff act as supervision (if you're falling over, passing out, have alcohol poisoning, are starting fights or other similar things, they'll get involved), and most people are more aware of the need to be conscious enough to get home.  When people can't buy alcohol legally they end up treating alcohol as a scarce resource, which leads to them drinking whenever they have the opportunity.  Ironically, this often leads to them drinking much *more* frequently than people who can legally drink.  Similarly, because alcohol is a \"risky\" thing for underage people to keep around (particularly in residence), they're more likely to drink whatever they have fairly promptly rather than storing it.\n\nWhile living in residence may have played a role in this due to differing levels of supervision, the pattern still mostly persisted with upper-year students who were still underage and was much less prominent for legal-age students in residence, so it seemed to be mostly connected to legal drinking.  It's unclear how much could be attributed to legal drinking versus number of years drinking (I'd generally expect people to shift towards more responsible drinking over time) and age."}, {"id": "cnfnhjw", "body": "Actually here in the US.

Conversely, when compliance improved after speed limits are raised, accidents tended to decrease.\n\nIt largely makes sense when you look at it in context of the rest of the study. Basically, people drive however the fuck they want, without regard to the limit. Raise it, lower it, either way - most people ignore it and just keep on keepin' on. But extrapolating further - there are archetypical driver personalities that come in to play, which probably come in to play in creating those effects.\n\nThere's a few kinds of driver.

I'm actually relatively certain that this article and that cherry picked quote, are where that myth originated, and is then perpetuated through confirmation bias of cases where the speed limit is lowered unnecessarily (with the logic that was used prior to this study) and when raised, accidents reduce. \n\nThey address it well in the report: \n\n&gt;Arbitrary, unrealistic and nonuniform speed limits have created a socially acceptable disregard for speed limits. Unrealistic limits increase accident risks for persons who attempt to comply with limit by driving slower or faster than the majority of road users, Unreasonably low limits significantly decrease driver compliance and give road users such as person not familiar with the road and pedestrians, a false indication of actual traffic speeds.\n\n&gt;Unrealistically high speed limits increase accident risk for drivers who are inexperienced or who disregard the basic speed law. Unrealistic limits also place enforcement officials and judges in the position of subjectively selecting and punishing violators. This practice can result in punishing average drivers, as well as high-risk violators.\n\n&gt;For years, traffic engineering texts have supported the conclusion that motorists ignore unreasonable speed limits. Both formal research and informal operational observations conducted for many years indicate that there is very little change in the mean or 85th percentile speed as the result of raising or lowering the posted limit.

Look at the number of people who begin smoking after 18 vs before...  Its almost completely before vs after and the reason why has been attributed to teenagers rebelling and feeling they're getting away with something.

Regardless, a law which is grossly ignored is bad because all it does is increase distrust in the system and in the other laws...  \n\nSpeed limit signs are a great example.  When 90% of speed limit signs are too low, too slow for conditions, slower than necessary for pedestrian or driver safety...  Then you get people ignoring all signs, even when you're in a school zone and they're vitally important.  \n\nHuman psych needs to be taken into account in these situations.

More to the point, fewer than half of teens have been drinking regularly (&gt;12 drinks) or have been really consistently disregarding the law. So the law is followed more than you might think. \n\nMost importantly, just because a law is regularly broken doesn't mean it does not do good. \n\n* It scares some kids into not drinking to avoid police consequences\n\n* It makes it difficult for kids to obtain alcohol, reducing the chance of them drinking\n\n* It makes it more expensive for kids to buy alcohol (due to bribes or paying older middlemen), limiting who can buy it and how much they can get\n\nBasically, just because the law isn't followed doesn't mean it doesn't prevent lots of kids from drinking, and it means that they drink less often on average and when they drink they probably drink less than they might want to. Sure it's broken a lot, but it is also NOT BROKEN frequently in situations where kids would drink if they could.

I am abstracting from the question of whether any of these systems are true.\n\nFirst, some vocabulary. A substance, for the rationalists, is something that can exist by itself, without depending on anything else for its existence. We normally think that there are many substances, and that these include everyday concrete particulars like cars and trees and so on. Substances have attributes, like being green or round or whatever, and they also have modes, i.e., perspectives from which we can view them.\n\nThe core claim of Spinoza's system is that the only substance that exists is God. Every other so-called \"thing\" is only a mode, or way of appearing, of God. God has infinitely many attributes with infinitely many modes, and all of these attributes and modes follow from God with ironclad logical necessity like that of 1+1=2. The only two attributes we are aware of are thought and extension.\n\nDescartes accepts the claim that everything else depends on God for its existence, but he attempts to avoid the conclusion that God is the only substance by arguing that other things are substances in a secondary sense. This is clearly a weak distinction, so his position threatens to collapse into Spinozism.\n\nSimilarly, Leibniz argues that there are infinitely many monads arranged into a hierarchy with the most powerful monad, God, on the top. This also threatens to collapse into Spinozism because it makes everything other than God depend on God for its existence, which means that God is the only substance by definition.\n\nSo, Descartes and Leibniz collapse into Spinoza.
