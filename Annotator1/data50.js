This reduction in penile motility is exacerbated by the fact he is forced to rely on friction as a means of stimulation.\n\nThe foreskin and sebaceous glands also function to keep the glans moist and lubricated, thus facilitating penetration (studies have confirmed having the foreskin makes penetration easier).\n\nIf by \"complete sexual functions\" you mean getting an erection and ejaculating, yes, those remain largely uninhibited by circumcision at least early on in life (the cumulative effect of externalizing the glans for decades should be obvious. E.g. one study in the International Journal of Men's Health shows that circumcised men have a 4.5 times greater chance of suffering from erectile dysfunction).\n\nBut penises have many more sexual functions than merely getting hard and shooting cum. The penis itself facilitates sex and procreation in a number of surprising ways. Another example is timing the male and female orgasm so that they happen simultaneously, which has been shown to improve chances to conceive.

For work I do Benefits Investigations for prescription coverage and do Prior Authorizations, and I am a volunteer navigator with the ACA. \n\nThe main thing with healthcare is it is stupid complicated. Every payor is different, every site is different, and coding for services is complicated. For example I recently had an urgent care visit that was billed as out of network, even though I looked on the website to find an in network clinic. The reason was they billed the service under the provider, who was filling in that day and not normally at that clinic. A minor error, but one I had to call and have them resubmit with the clinic's NPI number instead of the physicians. \n\nThere is a reason it is this complicated. Each payor is trying to control costs, by requiring certain criteria for services, or paying less when you go \"out of network\" or the set of providers they have negotiated a lower rate with. It's why you have to get PA for certain newer brand medications, because they want you to try the cheaper generics. If those are effective, it saves money (for both them, and subscribers). Or why you have to get a PA for services like an MRI, because they want the provider to prove that you really need that service, instead of just saying well lets try a cat scan. They want to know that the patient has had a cough and shortness of breath for 4 weeks, and respiratory inflammation that has not abaited with steroids or antibiotics (also me this year).\n\nEach healthcare provider tries to meet these demands, but paperwork is becoming increasingly difficult and more time demanding. Physicians constantly have pulls on their time, and they don't have time to resubmit a PA 4 times, when it's easier for you to just try something else.  \n\nThere are a whole lot of factors that go into insurance, and I can't address your every complaint without literally knowing how each of your plans worked. But typically Insurance you buy is locally based (because its easier to negotiate lower prices with a smaller number of providers), but they will cover emergency stuff out of network, you just have to pay a higher price for it. And these ridiculous out of network stories you have probably heard about (100K for anti snake venom for example) are largely a thing of the past, because thanks to the ACA all non grandfathered plans have an OOP limit to your plans (if 10k per individual is affordable is debatebale, but alot better than no limit). You typically have to have a PA for expensive services, or services where their is a cheaper alternative.\n\nI wont get into the current healthcare vs single payor argument, although I feel single payor takes a vast majority of these headaches away. But even Medicare, which is single payor in the USA requires PA's. It's not something you get away from. \n\nGetting to the crux of my arguement. Insurance may be a hassel, and a pain to deal with. But you never know when you may really need it. I recently renrolled someone in insurance. She had been feeling ill and lethargic for a few years, but had no insurance. She couldn't afford to have tests or see a specialist, and the waiting list for charity care were years long. She finally got insurance last year, and it turns out she had a brain tumor that was messing up her hormones. Having insurance has literally been life changing for her. She was able to get surgery, and medicines to help her recover, and is back to work 8 months later.  "}, {"id": "2q3vhk", "body": "I used to be really good about getting health insurance.

You seem to have had really crappy insurance that keeps premiums down by avoiding payouts; not all insurance is this way. \n\nHere's an example of what I mean by 'risk management'... \n\nI own a $450,000 house built on post and pier foundation rather than a poured cement foundation. Even a mild earthquake could tip the whole thing off kilter and red-tag the house permanently, requiring a complete teardown and rebuild. Now earthquakes are rare,  so it will most likely never be an issue but if it does happen,  I'm bankrupt.  Most of my savings are tied up in the house and I will probably never be able to recover. My retirement is shot and I'll be in debt until I die if this happens. Catastrophic ,  right? \n\nSo I buy earthquake insurance. For the cost of a couple of nice meals at a restaurant per month, I will have the cost of rebuilding my house covered for me. If the place is destroyed then I only have to pay the deductible.  This I can cover with my cash reserves.  This means I'm not raiding my retirement funds,  I don't even gain extra debt,  and I don't spend my old age in a cheap apartment eating cat food. \n\nI hope I never have to use it.  If I pay $30k over many years and sell the place never having to collect on the policy then I'll be a happy man. Buy that's 30years of never worrying that every day just might bankrupt me if there should happen to be a tremor. \n\nIt's the same with health insurance...  You are a just an instant of distraction away from life-altering injury every time you are near a moving car.  Major sickness could hit you tomorrow.

I paid $300 a month for 10k deductible, and never really paid much attention to it.\n\nI've had some health problems over the last year and have had to actually use my plan recently.  I know since I had high deductible I wasn't  going to really save much, but I thought I would at least get negotiated rates.  \n\nWell they didn't want to reimburse me for in network stuff, was given a different reason to every CSR I spoke to, just gave me the run around even though I should be covered.  I then had same issue with another company on prescriptions.  From searching around this seems to be common practice.  They just basically make it impossible.\n\nNow I'm thinking if I do have a catastrophic event, what is preventing insurance from deciding they don't want to pay?  I've seen articles of people getting claims denied because ambulance took them to the wrong hospital.  It seems they will look for any reason to do it.\n\nI've also had to pay everything in regards to mental health completely out of pocket, and nothing counts toward deductible.\n\nI just moved to a new state, and should be getting health insurance, but in talking to the sales agent, when pressing on these issues got the same vague double speak I previously got and just stopped searching.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But games most, if not all, games were made to be playable with just the (amazing) controller, even in the games it would benefit from most, like first person shooters.\n\nOn the PC, very very few games require a gamepad for playing. I am sure there are games which require it, but the only one I can think of is Dark Souls, which is an incredibly shitty port, but even then the game's playable with KB+M.\n\nA common feature between all these platforms is that they all are made to be controlled with existing input methods every device of that type needs: KB+M for PC, controllers for consoles, so it stands to reason that the smartphone would use its main method of input, the touchscreen, as its controller in games. \n\nBut the smartphone and tablet have another method of input: physical buttons. These buttons are used for powering on/off the phone and volume control. To remove that functionality would ruin the purpose of those buttons, which is specifically to power on/off the phone or adjust the volume.

How do you put your life on the line and say \"not on my watch\" then, in the same breath, say \"no matter what I'm going home tonight. No matter who I have to kill. Whether I'm really in danger or not because I shoot first and assess threats second because I'm going home tonight.\"? They killed someone for, maybe, selling an untaxed cigarette. Then defended the guy, after admitting he used an illegal choke and too much force, for something he didn't need to use any force for, and still let him keep his job. That will make the crazies come out... Why was the cop who killed Garner so likely to use excessive/ lethal force? Why did none of the other handful of cops there tell him he was both breaking the rules and going too far? Why did all those black people get stopped and frisked unconstitutionally?

The Court stated: \u201cWhere the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right. What may be murder in the first case might be nothing more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no offense had been committed.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAn arrest made with a defective warrant, or one issued without affidavit, or one that fails to allege a crime is within jurisdiction, and one who is being arrested, may resist arrest and break away. If the arresting officer is killed by one who is so resisting, the killing will be no more than an involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Housh v. People, 75 111. 491; reaffirmed and quoted in State v. Leach, 7 Conn. 452; State v. Gleason, 32 Kan. 245; Ballard v. State, 43 Ohio 349; State v Rousseau, 241 P. 2d 447; State v. Spaulding, 34 Minn. 3621.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhen a person, being without fault, is in a place where he has a right to be, is violently assaulted, he may, without retreating, repel by force, and if, in the reasonable exercise of his right of self defense, his assailant is killed, he is justified.\u201d Runyan v. State, 57 Ind. 80; Miller v. State, 74 Ind. \n\n \n\n\u201cThese principles apply as well to an officer attempting to make an arrest, who abuses his authority and transcends the bounds thereof by the use of unnecessary force and violence, as they do to a private individual who unlawfully uses such force and violence.\u201d Jones v. State, 26 Tex. App. I; Beaverts v. State, 4 Tex. App. 1 75; Skidmore v. State, 43 Tex. 93, 903.\n\n \n\n\u201cAn illegal arrest is an assault and battery. The person so attempted to be restrained of his liberty has the same right to use force in defending himself as he would in repelling any other assault and battery.\u201d (State v. Robinson, 145 ME. 77, 72 ATL. 260).\n\n \n\n\u201cEach person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest. In such a case, the person attempting the arrest stands in the position of a wrongdoer and may be resisted by the use of force, as in self-defense.\u201d (State v. Mobley, 240 N.C. 476, 83 S.E. 2d 100).\n\n \n\n\u201cOne may come to the aid of another being unlawfully arrested, just as he may where one is being assaulted, molested, raped or kidnapped. Thus it is not an offense to liberate one from the unlawful custody of an officer, even though he may have submitted to such custody, without resistance.\u201d (Adams v.

State, 136 Ind. 306, 34 N.E. 968 (1983) actually says.  First, the opinion of the Indiana Supreme Court doesn\u2019t have the quoted material anywhere in the opinion.  Not even in the headnotes (which are not part of the opinion anyway).  Second, what the opinion does say is the exact opposite.  It states \u201c[i]f the officer is resisted before he has used needless force and violence, he may then press forward and overcome such resistance, even to the taking of the life of the person arrested, if absolutely necessary.\u201d Id. at 313, 34 N.E. at 969 (emphasis added).  If the officer is being resisted, then the officer can use any force necessary, up to and including deadly force.  Nothing at all about the citizen using deadly force.  What the opinion does state is that if the officer uses unnecessary, excessive force, a person has the right to defend themselves from that excessive force.  Here the officer hit Plummer over the head from behind with a billy club, and then shot at Plummer.  Plummer shot back, more accurately, and killed Marshal Dorn.  The court said \u201c[w]hen a person, being without fault, is in a place where he has a right to be, is violently assaulted, he may, without retreating, repel force by force, and if, in the reasonable exercise of his right of self-defense, his assailant is killed, he is justifiable.\u201d  Id. at 314, 34 N.E. at 970.

I've come to the conclusion that prisons as a system of harboring all criminals are petty and worthless and that our society would be better served by forcing non-violent criminals to lose whatever associated privileges they had with their crimes and pay back their communities through fines or community service.\n\nEssentially, I'm advocating for anyone who doesn't murder, rape, assault, or intentionally cause such things to come to bear on others - that they should never be jailed.\n\n**As an example**: A man recently drove 75 in a 45 and passed a truck that cut him off on the right, striking a bicyclist on the shoulder and killing him. He promptly stopped and called 911.\n\nWhat the man did was awful, but I'm quite sure that nobody would consider what he did to be intentional or malicious. He's not a danger to society so long as the privilege he abused (driving) is kept in check. As such, I would think long-term to indefinite suspension of his license and hefty fines/community service are preferable to locking him up.\n\nCan you CMV? *I recognize that I'm no expert on prisons* and I would like to think our penal system has evolved out of something more than just petty vengeance... but considering you can be locked up for *years* for carrying dried up leaves of the wrong kind of plant in your pocket in 48 of the 50 states, or be locked up for sleeping in public - it really makes me reconsider the nature of what we've adopted.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But in a case like Enron, I think an important aspect of the judicial system is acknowledging the seriousness of the crimes. I actually think /u/TuckerMcG did a better job of articulating what I was going for later in the thread, so I'll just quote him here. \n\n&gt; So first of all, our prison system isn't based solely on vengeance. But it's important to recognize that retribution is a large factor behind why we have a penal system at all. As a society, most people agree that ordinary citizens should not take the law into their own hands. Vigilantism is bad because it deprives suspected criminals of their due process of law. Without the retributive aspects of the penal system, society runs the risk that victims or the families of victims of crimes that go unpunished will try to impart their own sense of justice. So unless you think that vigilante justice is more \"just\" than the penal system, you have to accept that the retributive aspects of the penal system are warranted. \n\nObviously, there are lots of different ways to interpret that (and I definitely agree with the overall point that prison is overused for nonviolent crimes. I think it absolutely is) but I do think that the courts need the power of prison, in particular for crimes like Enron's that hurt SO many people. (Plus, let's not even get started on the power outages in CA that they were responsible for, where perhaps people did get hurt as a result. Who knows?) \n\nAs an aside: you should definitely check out *More Sex is Safer Sex*. It's a book by an econ professor (in a similar vien to *Freakenomics*) that has a bunch of short essays on the econ of social issues. In it, he argues pretty convincingly (citing another two economists, who I'm now forgetting) a link between using the death penalty and decreasing crimes. BUT then turns around and points out that in order to achieve that link, you have to administer the death penalty rapidly and without much due process, and therefor it's unethical. It's an interesting little essay about balancing efficacy in the law with ethics. Not related to this convo, but you might enjoy it! (Plus the title essay is funny.)

A $1,000 fine would be a huge hit. Now, if you're making $2,000,000/year, and you get slapped with a fine that takes 5% of your income, that's a $100,000 fine.

Sure, you set the fire and burned down a guy's house, but what you *really* did was create the danger that the fire might spread to the next house, or the apartment building, killing dozens of people, or kill the firefighter that went in to save the old lady who was too infirm to leave herself.

I've come to the conclusion that prisons as a system of harboring all criminals are petty and worthless and that our society would be better served by forcing non-violent criminals to lose whatever associated privileges they had with their crimes and pay back their communities through fines or community service.\n\nEssentially, I'm advocating for anyone who doesn't murder, rape, assault, or intentionally cause such things to come to bear on others - that they should never be jailed.\n\n**As an example**: A man recently drove 75 in a 45 and passed a truck that cut him off on the right, striking a bicyclist on the shoulder and killing him. He promptly stopped and called 911.\n\nWhat the man did was awful, but I'm quite sure that nobody would consider what he did to be intentional or malicious. He's not a danger to society so long as the privilege he abused (driving) is kept in check. As such, I would think long-term to indefinite suspension of his license and hefty fines/community service are preferable to locking him up.\n\nCan you CMV? *I recognize that I'm no expert on prisons* and I would like to think our penal system has evolved out of something more than just petty vengeance... but considering you can be locked up for *years* for carrying dried up leaves of the wrong kind of plant in your pocket in 48 of the 50 states, or be locked up for sleeping in public - it really makes me reconsider the nature of what we've adopted.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But it's important to recognize that retribution is a large factor behind why we have a penal system at all. As a society, most people agree that ordinary citizens should not take the law into their own hands. Vigilantism is bad because it deprives suspected criminals of their due process of law. Without the retributive aspects of the penal system, society runs the risk that victims or the families of victims of crimes that go unpunished will try to impart their own sense of justice. So unless you think that vigilante justice is more \"just\" than the penal system, you have to accept that the retributive aspects of the penal system are warranted. \n\nSecond, there are TONS of non-violent crimes that can lead to vigilante justice if they go unpunished. What about white collar crimes? Bernie Madoff could never pay off the billions of dollars that he swindled people out of because all of his money was other people's money. What he took, he could never repay, no matter how much community service he did. If you lost all of your life savings because of Madoff, don't you think you'd want to kill him for ruining your life if he walked the streets scot-free? If not, can't you understand that while you may not feel that way, that other people *might* feel that way? So is it really more \"just\" to allow him to roam the streets, knowing that he'll likely get blown away by a crazed victim who has nothing else to lose and just wants some revenge? \n\nNow, I don't want you to rebut each of those points individually. I only bring up Madoff as a hypothetical thought-experiment for you. It's a good example of why non-violent offenders should be able to be subjected to large punishments. Because sometimes non-violent crimes can result in irreparable harm to the victims of those crimes. \n\nAnother good example is Charles Manson. Most people don't know this, but Charles Manson didn't kill anybody himself. He was never even charged with homicide of any kind (i.e. murder or manslaughter). The legal theory that got him thrown in jail was that he exhibited such *control* over the minds of his followers that they were essentially extensions of himself. They were innocent instrumentalities of his psychopathic tendencies. All he did was convince these wayward teenagers that Helter Skelter (basically, the end of the world) was coming and the only way to prevent it would be to kill all the \"pigs\" (essentially, celebrities and other fat cats who reinforce \"the system\"). Then, he gave the teenagers certain information that would allow them to locate various \"pigs\". And then he just left them up to their own devices. All of this was puppeteered by Manson through psychedelic drug use, which the followers were all willing participants of. In short, his actions were completely non-violent. The only reason that he was able to convicted was because the DA (Vincent Bugliosi) was a fucking brilliant prosecutor and he created an entirely new legal theory off of which criminal liability could be proven. Bugliosi himself has conceded that it was a real stretch of the law for Manson to get convicted due to just how attenuated his involvement was in the Sharon Tate murders. But it was clear that the teenagers wouldn't have committed those murders without Manson's priming and manipulation. \n\nShould Charles Manson not be in prison? Your idea would say that he should not. He was convicted of conspiracy. That's it. And he got the death penalty for it (the only reason he's not dead is because CA changed their laws in the 80's to abolish the death penalty, but when they reinstated the death penalty they couldn't boost Manson's relegated LWOP sentence back up to the death penalty). \n\nMy point in all of this is to show you that non-violent crimes can have the same devastating effect as violent crimes. Does this apply to ALL non-violent crimes? Absolutely not. Nobody would think that you should be imprisoned for something like jaywalking. But even your example of the guy driving 75mph in a 45 who caused a wreck presents an issue with your theory.\n\nBased upon your example, it seems like you only think criminals should be punished if they were knowingly or intentionally committing the crime. But that ignores people who are negligent (i.e. a reasonable person would have been aware that a risk of harm would result from their actions) or people who are reckless (i.e. who recognize a risk of harm would result from their actions, but failed to prevent that harm from materializing). Why should people who are negligent or reckless be excused from prison? If a worker at a nuclear power plant sees that the core is about to meltdown, but he does nothing to stop it, what crime does he commit when the reactor kills thousands? He didn't intentionally kill anyone. That wasn't his thought process. Let's just assume he just had to get to his kid's ballet recital and couldn't deal with fixing a meltdown. So what crime is he guilty of under your conception of the law? It's the same as the driver, even though the result is much worse. But why would being the proximate cause of one person's death be any different than being the proximate cause of 1000 people's deaths? In both instances, neither person intended to kill anybody. But just like going 75 mph in a 45 mph, the power plant employee should have realized that his actions bring on a certain risk. And we shouldn't allow people to escape penalties for being negligent or reckless in the face of these risks. \n\nI just want to conclude by saying that I know my examples are hyperbolic. But that's the point. Taking your argument to the extremes helps shed light on the inconsistencies within your logic. But if I were to sum up the reasons why your position is flawed, it would be that you understate the value of the retributive aspects of the penal system; that you overstate the harmlessness of reckless or negligent actions; and that you think that any non-violent crime can adequately be atoned for through community service or repayment. None of those positions hold up in the real world, since humans are innately vengeful creatures; since lack of intent does not mitigate the damage proximately caused by ones actions; and since certain non-violent violent crimes have devastating, far-reaching effects that one person can never \"make right\". While I can absolutely concede that sentencing for non-violent criminals can be way too harsh, that doesn't mean that non-violent criminals shouldn't be punished by imprisonment.
