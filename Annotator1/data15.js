Human nature is neither capitalist nor communist. Humans obviously have many \"selfish\" (more capitalist) qualities but we also have many \"selfless\" (more communist) qualities that I think you are ignoring. Empathy for and identifying with unrelated people would have been selected against if we were as capitalistic as you argue. An extreme example of this quality is humanity's penchant for violent conflict between groups of unrelated individuals, often rallied around some abstract identity--be it the tribe, kingdom, or nation. If we were completely capitalistic, as I am gathering that you define capitalist traits, then going to war and dying for a group of people, many of whom you are not biologically related to, would be highly disadvantageous in nature. Thus, many biologists and anthropologists believe that humans gain some sort of advantage from one another that goes beyond blood lines. You are, however, very right that there are people who will always take more than they give. In evolutionary theory, these are called \"cheaters\" or \"defectors.\" Almost all social systems in nature, even the most social (eusocial) like ants and bees, have these. Cheaters are dealt with through a variety of means that punish defective behavior and thus make cheating more \"expensive.\"  Examples of sanctioning institutions already exist in society--for example, the department of justice or the IRS. While it may sound illogical on paper to pay a little of your own capital (via taxes) to punish a cheater, research has shown that human groups with sanctioning institutions are evolutionarily advantageous. \n\nSo while I personally believe the optimal form of society exists somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between free-market capitalism and communism, I don't think it is true that communism is completely against human nature. On the flip side of the, capitalism is not completely against human nature either. Again, humans are highly social but not completely eusocial. \n\nEDIT: Here is [the paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/312/5770/108) that shows that sanctioning institutions are more advantageous in the long run and that groups with them outcompete more laissez faire groups. Interestingly, it also shows that human competition and behavior can be selected for in ways akin to natural selection. There is actually an emerging field in evolutionary biology called [cultural evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution), which seeks to understand how cultures and society change over time and how natural selection-like processes shape these changes.

Cigars are more rush prone, but smoked slowly it's usually very mild. As a consequence, it seems the nicotine equivalent of having a beer (pipes) or a glass of Scotch (cigars) insofar as \"drunkenness\" and addiction and health risk is concerned. I don't think that the occasional bowl of tobacco or cigar, or even several times a week, is that big a deal. I think the daily use is probably less risky than a daily cheeseburger, and riskier than daily coffee.\n\nHealth aside, regarding addiction: I began smoking pipe tobacco in late 2012 for my own reasons. Sometimes I had tobacco for months, sometimes I went without, but I generally had it. I never had withdrawal symptoms. Between that, I tried [snuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_%28tobacco%29) here and there. More recently my sources dried up and a friend of mine really got into cigars, and began sharing high quality cigars with me. Often several a week, until we went to the Comic Con of cigars, Cigar Aficionado's Big Smoke, in which I picked up almost 100 \"samples\"--full high quality cigars from top manufacturers. I began smoking cigars daily.\n\nRecently I got ahold of pipe tobacco and got over cigars. I don't like how heavy they are. Still, for several months I had daily cigars, which were orders of magnitude heavier and harder-hitting than any pipe tobacco I could hope to chain smoke. Anyway, I haven't missed cigars since switching back to pipe tobacco, and my pipe tobacco dosage didn't really go up. I can notice that the pipe tobacco is significantly milder.\n\nAnyway, I just quit the pipe tobacco because I didn't want to sour my pipe and forgot about it, and have been off of it for almost a week.\n\nNo cravings or withdrawal symptoms.\n\nI do acknowledge that nicotine is addictive, saying otherwise is ludicrous. However, I don't think that pipes or cigars can render a person \"dependent\" like cigarettes, and are probably less aggressive than coffee insofar as addiction is concerned. This is unanimously what pipe smokers in particular report, but I didn't fully believe it until I experienced it.\n\nTobacco isn't that bad. Some forms are insidious, but the risk isn't that much greater than for ordinary daily risks, and is only pronounced if abused; which addiction might tempt, but it isn't powerful enough to cause the insatiable heroin/coke/etc. type addiction to nicotine that cigarettes do.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Yes but MJ is a *drug*.\""}, {"id": "2r7gh3", "body": "I don't think tobacco is that bad. I've had family members addicted and die as a consequence of smoking cigarettes, but a cigarette is like taking nicotine shots, it's not surprising that 40-60 a day will kill you dead. It seems to me that the insidiousness of cigarettes has led to a *Reefer Madness* hysteria against tobacco products in general.\n\n**My view is that cigarettes and even chew are that bad, but this is due to the level of exposure and intensity of it.** \n\nPipe tobacco, for example, rarely gives a \"nicotine rush\" and a good smoke is considered relaxing. Cigars are more rush prone, but smoked slowly it's usually very mild. As a consequence, it seems the nicotine equivalent of having a beer (pipes) or a glass of Scotch (cigars) insofar as \"drunkenness\" and addiction and health risk is concerned. I don't think that the occasional bowl of tobacco or cigar, or even several times a week, is that big a deal. I think the daily use is probably less risky than a daily cheeseburger, and riskier than daily coffee.\n\nHealth aside, regarding addiction: I began smoking pipe tobacco in late 2012 for my own reasons. Sometimes I had tobacco for months, sometimes I went without, but I generally had it. I never had withdrawal symptoms. Between that, I tried [snuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_%28tobacco%29) here and there. More recently my sources dried up and a friend of mine really got into cigars, and began sharing high quality cigars with me. Often several a week, until we went to the Comic Con of cigars, Cigar Aficionado's Big Smoke, in which I picked up almost 100 \"samples\"--full high quality cigars from top manufacturers. I began smoking cigars daily.\n\nRecently I got ahold of pipe tobacco and got over cigars. I don't like how heavy they are. Still, for several months I had daily cigars, which were orders of magnitude heavier and harder-hitting than any pipe tobacco I could hope to chain smoke. Anyway, I haven't missed cigars since switching back to pipe tobacco, and my pipe tobacco dosage didn't really go up. I can notice that the pipe tobacco is significantly milder.\n\nAnyway, I just quit the pipe tobacco because I didn't want to sour my pipe and forgot about it, and have been off of it for almost a week.\n\nNo cravings or withdrawal symptoms.\n\nI do acknowledge that nicotine is addictive, saying otherwise is ludicrous. However, I don't think that pipes or cigars can render a person \"dependent\" like cigarettes, and are probably less aggressive than coffee insofar as addiction is concerned. This is unanimously what pipe smokers in particular report, but I didn't fully believe it until I experienced it.\n\nTobacco isn't that bad. Some forms are insidious, but the risk isn't that much greater than for ordinary daily risks, and is only pronounced if abused; which addiction might tempt, but it isn't powerful enough to cause the insatiable heroin/coke/etc. type addiction to nicotine that cigarettes do.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Throughout human history, conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. It's ruthless, yes, but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors.

[ (Not from the movie, but from here) ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=sa7rmohv1hmgymf4xdu8cait&amp;page=27#660) It summed up my feelings about the movie quite well. Throughout human history, conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. It's ruthless, yes, but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation, invention, progress, technology, and science. Not only does this secure survivability, but also increases standard of living.\n\nColonel Quaritch, as well as the other miners, were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Na'vi inhabited. \n\nArguably, Colonel Quaritch **COULD** have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead, a chance to evacuate is given, and Quaritches forces **target Hometree itself, not the Na'vi** The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents, nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree, and not the extermination of the people.\n\n\nNext, Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Na'vi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch **COULD** have met them in battle, but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol, thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Na'vi and Human. \n\n\nThe culture of the Na'vi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered, but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance, and I'm interested to see what the sequel holds for them. In the mean time, I feel Colonel Quaritch's actions were rational, reasonable, justifiable, and the correct course of action. My friend disagreed, and I'm more than open for discussion to better understand the opposing view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

[ (Not from the movie, but from here) ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=sa7rmohv1hmgymf4xdu8cait&amp;page=27#660) It summed up my feelings about the movie quite well. Throughout human history, conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. It's ruthless, yes, but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation, invention, progress, technology, and science. Not only does this secure survivability, but also increases standard of living.\n\nColonel Quaritch, as well as the other miners, were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Na'vi inhabited. \n\nArguably, Colonel Quaritch **COULD** have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead, a chance to evacuate is given, and Quaritches forces **target Hometree itself, not the Na'vi** The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents, nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree, and not the extermination of the people.\n\n\nNext, Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Na'vi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch **COULD** have met them in battle, but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol, thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Na'vi and Human. \n\n\nThe culture of the Na'vi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered, but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance, and I'm interested to see what the sequel holds for them. In the mean time, I feel Colonel Quaritch's actions were rational, reasonable, justifiable, and the correct course of action. My friend disagreed, and I'm more than open for discussion to better understand the opposing view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

From their perspective, the humans are clearly in the wrong.\n\nThe humans are only 'right' if we consider conquest and colonialism as the measures of a civilizations success, which arguably are shitty measures given that they are at odds with most of nature (what other animals mine? What other animals detonate nukes?), not to mention threaten the life of humanity itself. \n\nThink of the Matrix, when Smith compares humanity to a virus, spreading like wildfire and killing everything it touches, including the very biosphere that makes humanity even possible. Would you say this is \"right\"? Is it a great success when a virus wipes out it's host, killing itself in the process?

It's worth mentioning that he was a mercenary, not a soldier, and that the army that took down Hometree was a re-fitted mining op, not a professional army. Given what he had to work with, I'd say he did okay. The issue isn't with him, but rather his superiors as well as the larger human society that make his actions necessary.\n\nAnd also, on that quote specifically, I think it's worth noting that this is Quaritch justifying his actions after they've already began. He didn't come to Pandora to further human civilization; he came because it was his job. His superiors didn't start mining on Pandora because they want to further civilization; they did it because they wanted to make money (it was a corporation if I recall). Humanities' forays into space weren't done as voyages of discovery or to bring civilization to the galaxy; it was done because earth was running out of space/resources (if I recall correctly the hero mentions at one point that Earth is a shit hole). \n\nQuaritch killed a lot of aliens, burned down some forest, and they decided to justify it after the fact as bringing the light of civilization into the cosmos.

This includes lots of pot boiler paperbacks and exploitative TV shows like To Catch a Predator but also includes indisputably important works of literature like The Executioner's Song (which won the pulitzer), In Cold Blood (which should have won the pulitzer) and Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, which helped create The Wire. \n\nIn the case of Serial, the producers went thought huge efforts to treat this as journalism rather than pure entertainment. This is as much an investigation into the criminal justice system, and of journalistic inquiry itself as it is the story of Adnan Syed or Hae Min Lee. [If you listen to this interview with Sarah K on Fresh Air](http://www.npr.org/2014/12/23/372577482/serial-host-sarah-koenig-says-she-set-out-to-report-not-exonerate), it's clear that she went through a great deal of effort not to use people's real names when she didn't have to and to do her best to protect everyone involved. For example, by not using the name of the person who first found Hae's body / person who really liked to streak through the streets of Baltimore. \n\nI think that too many people listened to Serial like it was a novel with an actual ending than as a work of serialized journalism. You can see this in the number of people who thought that the last episode would end in the identification of the real killer. But at the end, all we have is the journalistic journey rather than solid conclusions. And that's the point of this season of Serial: that there can be a difference between thinking that Adnan killed Hae and thinking beyond a reasonable doubt that Adnan is guilty of the crime of Murder in the First Degree "}, {"id": "2r6vy8", "body": "This podcast is like a smaller version of the OJ Simpson trial, with all the same sensationalization and vitriol around it.

This is true- just because somebody does well on a test, this does not mean they are automatically intelligent and vice versa- those who do badly or cheat are not necessarily stupid. \n\nThere is no perfect way to measure intelligence, and this is the root of the problem. There is that old saying about standardised testing, that measuring everybody on the same qualities is as useless as judging monkey and a fish on their abilities to climb a tree.\n\nUnfortunately, the system we have is not perfect. However, within the system we have (standardised tests), cheating does cause a disservice to those obeying the rules. If the point of the test is to rank those who take it against each other, any ranking that involved cheating is not going to tell the truth. Even though we say the ranking system is inherently flawed- how perfectly can it fully represent each persons abilities- the fact still remains that within the confines of the test, in order to accurately judge relative ability all need to obey the rules. If this is not followed, accuracy is lost. \n\nWhen these tests are used to ultimately progress in life, disservice translates into missed college spaces, missed job offers etc. \n\nIf one wants to argue that cheating is no disservice to those who play the system properly, then one needs to remove the albeit flawed system. It's a lot harder to suggest that cheating is no disservice to others when the system is in place. \n\nAs a society we struggle to find another system, where intelligence and aptitude is fairly comprehended, ranked and used as a marker for ability."}, {"id": "2r6n7q", "body": "\nI'm a 17 year old in highschool, and I rarely cheat.

In the sense you are speaking of, the decomposition process has begun since before it was purchased by you and is just as unsafe. Often expiration dates are more estimates than factual, I've had milk 2-3 days past the date on the carton which has been completely fine. Sell by dates pretty much mean \"this is something that is usually consumed close to purchase date; sell by this date so within a few days it'll be eaten as intended\" So if you get rolls that say sell by 1/5/15 you can probably eat them 1/7/15 without problem.\n\nIt mostly comes down to your own common sense. If your milk has chunks in it when you pour it out or your rolls have any indication of mold, you'd be safer not eating it.

That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don't. \"You just got that money because you're poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\n\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\n\n**Edit:** Well, I've only had reasons added to my list.\n\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\n\n5. To go with that, a student has no control over their parents, and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.\n\n6. To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I'm just getting really tired, I was pretty tired in the first place and didn't expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They don't. With very few exceptions they aren't making more money. They raise tuition because in order to compete for students they need to spend more money.\n\nThe larger problem with your argument is that colleges are subsidized by taxpayers who paid for their own college and don't have kids.  I think we agree that that is a good thing, but it means you can't accurately say that you are giving yourself a loan. You are getting a loan from people who have already paid for their education.

They don't. With very few exceptions they aren't making more money. They raise tuition because in order to compete for students they need to spend more money.\n\nThe larger problem with your argument is that colleges are subsidized by taxpayers who paid for their own college and don't have kids.

With some of my points I play Devil's Advocate just to pursue and assess multiple sides even if I don't believe the rhetoric entirely myself. \n\nWhile Driver's Licenses/License plates are fees, they are nothing close to the direct cost of the road, much less requiring massive loans. Yet the cost-per-foot of the roads are quite high. Public use and benefit for them go to all, as well as the cost. But you can also say that it's no more than the community impact of educated individuals creating new businesses, industries, and products that better the world.\n\nAdditionally, our point is the same about universities on money and their spending to attract students. Their highly-paid coaches and large stadiums are an example of their marketing department (people want to see Gator Football, for an example), and they want them to be the best to attract more students so they get more money to get better coaches, etc. I'm not saying that they do it so some Administrator makes a higher profit, though it definitely could have sounded that way. So there's clarity. :)\n\nI should add that there's a second-factor to my rhetoric; I don't believe that we need so many people going to school, and it's been pushed much more heavily in recent decades. While I believe many people that would do great in school avoid it due to the debt burden, there are many people who simply go to college that will contribute to society with careers that don't actually need a degree. Some don't even want to go but feel they should. The government-dictated funding would provide a harder cap on how many students are allowed enrollment, pushing the standards for entry upward, meaning that a greater percentage of the students enrolled are likely those that would receive greater benefit.\n\nMany industrialized nations offer education heavily subsidized or free compared to us. The common argument is that we're a bigger country and couldn't afford it. My reply is that because we're a bigger country we should be able to afford it more easily because we allow greater specialization in our nation with more people and a more diverse economy.\n\nKeep in mind that US Student Loan Debt as of June 2014 was 1.2 trillion. The Stimulus of 2008 (TARP) and the Bailout of 2008 (Emergency Economic Stabilization Act) were both around 700 billion dollars. For that cost we could have entirely wiped out all existing debt that covers many years' tuition and expenses at universities. The cost for 1 year of expenses at a university, if we budgeted, is laughable, especially considering that we'd drive the cost down if universities no longer had to market so aggressively and would thereby need less money to operate.

FICHTENBAUM: One of the most important factors driving price at public colleges and universities has been the decline in state support for higher education. Between 1987 and 2012, in real dollars, government support has declined from $8,497 to $5,906 per student.\n\n&gt; The second major culprit is rising costs. Critics of higher education often blame faculty salaries for rising costs. However, when measured in constant dollars, salaries for full-time faculty at public institutions have actually declined. What is driving costs is the metastasizing army of administrators with bloated salaries, and our university presidents who are now paid as though they were CEOs running a business\u2014and not a very successful one at that.\n\n&gt; There is also the growth in entertainment spending and spending on amenities. Many universities claim that they must compete and therefore have borrowed millions to build luxury dorms, new dining halls and rock-climbing walls. They also spend millions subsidizing intercollegiate athletics."}, {"id": "cncx3qp", "body": "That would be ideal, but it is admittedly a lot of money to just hand out.

But I'm honestly not sure there was much wiggle room even after the lifestyle changes they made. Sure they weren't going out for drinks with friends anymore. But they still had a mortgage to pay, two dependents at home to support, etc. Cost of living is not cheap in their area (philly suburbs). There were probably expenses they could have cut back on more but I can't say for sure as I was distracted with getting my own finances in order. And the two dependents didn't know about the job losses for a while, so maybe they were keeping up appearances so the dependents' day to day wasn't disrupted. I think at first with severance and savings they gambled on finding jobs quickly while being more frugal than usual and not contributing to savings anymore, but the job market was rougher than anticipated. So while the FAFSA calculation may be consistently applied to all applicants, it does not take into account cost of living variations (but that's a whole other issue). At $100k gross income, regardless of income source, FAFSA was saying they should be contributing over $40k for the year. That itself is pretty crazy when you factor in cost of living. \n\nAnyway.

Edit 3 basically perfectly describes the whole situation.\n\n\nI really wanna talk more about this. Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:\n\n1. You're screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don't wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\n\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don't. \"You just got that money because you're poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\n\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\n\n**Edit:** Well, I've only had reasons added to my list.\n\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\n\n5.

To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I'm just getting really tired, I was pretty tired in the first place and didn't expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy, but nope!)\n\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

My parents make about $100k a year combined, but are/were also massively in debt (they filed for bankruptcy during my sophomore year) and usually struggled as much with money as I do as a college student working part time. I think FAFSA usually put my estimated family contribution somewhere around $10,000, which is laughable. If my parents had that kind of money to spend on one of their three kids for college, they wouldn't have gone bankrupt, lost the house they built and lived in for 22 years, and be living in a fucking mobile home barely scarping by while piling up more credit card debt. The current system is pretty fucked up, and once again the middle class, which are supposed to be the biggest and most-supported class according to that myth of the American dream, is getting fucked in the ass. Ugh. \n\nI fortunately do have one small scholarship (that barely pays for one class and that I suffered through the fucking IB program to get), and I get loans from the government.
