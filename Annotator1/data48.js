For these people there is the hope of finding a treatment that works for them with manageable side effects. We don't have all the answers about mental illness, but we're working to make it better. \n\n\nIf everyone who had a debilitating mental illness killed themselves we wouldn't have many people to learn from. Working through mental illness to find a solution that will be effective in the long term is why that these suicides shouldn't be viewed this way. These people are also loved and should want to work through the issues for the people who care about them and for future generations. \n\n \nSuicide is by it's nature a selfish act. I will not go as far as to say that j don't sympathize with it, but will say that we can learn to help others because these people allow us to try to understand these people. A good example of this was the physicist who was hit by a proton beam. He was put in the hospital to observe what would happen with the expectation he would die. He allowed us to learn and actually survived.

With reddit being known for sucking people in and being a huge time waster, I don't have a problem with a workplace blocking it. (With the NSFW content that is rampant in reddit, it also helps prevent employees accidentally opening something that could get them fired.) I assume it is being blocked at my work, but I've never bothered to check. \n\nHowever, I do check reddit on my phone now and then. I have a stressful job where I am constantly switching between tasks and sometimes I just need to reset and take a breath. I can look at a few memes in 60 seconds. This gives me a chance to clear my head of the task I just completed and destress a bit. (With stress being so bad for health, I think this is a good tradeoff for the company as well.) This is the same thing people used to do with the newspaper years ago. \n\nAlso, given that most comments on reddit are one liner jokes, I don't think your assertion that people don't have time to post on break holds water. I also don't understand why you feel people shouldn't be able to take their break at their desk. Sometimes I just want to eat a quick lunch I brought from home. As a bonus, I am immediately available if something urgent comes up. \n\nThis is my take as how it applies to my job. Others have already made some good points about positions where you don't have a constant stream of work, but are being paid to be there so you can react quickly when it shows up.  Or positions where it is a resource. The point is, every job is different and has unique factors. To make a blanket statement implying that anyone who uses reddit at work is a bad employee isn't fair."}, {"id": "2q6816", "body": "I was just in a thread about how someone's work blocked reddit, and I thought good.

IF YOU'RE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA, LIKE, WHY? YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SPOILERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.**\n\nOkay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe I'm just closed-minded and white cisgendered homophobic (I hope I'm not, but hey). But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and \"ambiguous\" they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.\n\nugh...\n\n**Please, change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a \"main\" character is the best possible resolution for the show.** I want to love this show again. I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldn't hear it, so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. \n\nI refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to \"okay now we want you to hate the show so we don't have to do more\". I want to see the light, dammit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I don't care that they're les or bi or what the fuck ever. I hate that my opinion is automatically devalued as \"HOMOFOB NOOOOO\" by the vast majority of the ATLA and ALOK subreddits, not to even mention Tumblr.\n\nSorry this is long.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

And I think it's really important that she (and Asami) had those times to be romantically unattached. Both of their relationships with Mako were so cringey and juvenile it was clear they needed to grow a little before committing to a new relationship.\n\nAnd that's part of Korra's growth, I think. She was so childish and starry-eyed in the first season that she fell almost immediately into Mako's arms. But with Asami, it was a relationship that was built up for at least a season and a half (I'll explain more about that below). So yes, Korra is strong and independent, but she's grown to accept a relationship as a part of that, not in spite of it.\n\n*2.* I wouldn't argue Asami is a minor character. LoK is different from AtLA for two reasons: shorter seasons meant fewer filler episodes to really spend a lot of time to character development, and uncertain season renewals meant only season-long stories. How did this affect the relationship?\n\nWell it meant that most characters felt a little like \"minor characters\" besides Korra, really. If you watched season 4 on its own, you would never call Mako a main character. Besides that, we never get the filler episodes like in AtLA to spend an entire episode developing a relationship. There was never a \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\" episode for Korra to build development with Bolin by himself, or with Korra and Asami. We do get a *lot* of time with Korra and Asami together though, particularly in season 3. They ease their friendship by laughing at Mako for a while, and then they bond together in the desert and such. \n\n*3.* Their relationship felt like the opposite of rushed to me. Let's examine their relationship compared to Mako and Korra's in season 1.\n\nS1 E2: Korra and Mako meet. They're a little unfriendly with each other.\n\nS1 E3: Korra and Mako save Bolin from Amon. Korra holds Mako's arm to look like a couple to fool the guards.\n\nS1 E4: Mako starts dating Asami, effectively ending Makorra.\n\nS1 E5: Korra kisses Mako, and Mako gets mad at her. There's some slight jealousy there too, I guess.\n\nLook, in 4 episodes, Korra is opening her feelings up to Mako and kissing him. *4 episodes.* Now let's look at Asami and Korra post-Mako.\n\nS3 E1: Korra and Asami put aside their past relationships and decide to be friends.\n\nS3 E3: Korra and Asami get the Earth Queen's tax money from the safe, fight off bandits together. \n\nS3 E4-8 Korra, Asami, and the rest spend time together at Zaofu.\n\nS3 E9: Asami saves Korra from Zaheer and co, get captured by the Earth Queen.\n\nS3 E10: Asami and Korra escape the desert.\n\nS3 E13: Asami offers support for Korra after she was poisoned. They hold hands.\n\nS4 E2: We find out Korra has only been writing to Asami during her stay at the South Pole. \n\nS4 E7: Korra and Asami reunite. It's a little awkward, feelings are hurt because they lost touch, and even Mako asks, \"What's going on between you two?\" But they reconcile.\n\nS4 E8: Asami brings Korra tea and helps her think through her past battles with the other villains.\n\nS4 E13: Korra and Asami hug, then decide to vacation together. They hold hands and non-verbally acknowledge that there's something romantic between them.\n\nSo that was basically 2 seasons. It wasn't romantic the whole time, but they still had 2 seasons of development together and at the end, all they did was hold hands. They didn't profess undying love, they didn't have some big, showy, romantic kiss, they held hands. Compare that to Mako and Korra who took 4 episodes to get from zero to kiss.\n\nTo me, it wasn't OH THEY'RE LESBIANS SUDDENLY because, first, I think they're bisexuals (they both dated Mako, remember?) and second, they had 2 seasons of bonding in which to develop that relationship. Same-sex relationships often start from friendships where they eventually acknowledge stronger-than-friendship feelings for each other.\n\nAs for them leaving the world to fend for itself, well, they never said how long they'd be gone. Maybe they're only going for a week. Also, it's shown that some time passes between the wedding and their leaving (they change clothes and hairstyle for Korra). Besides that, it was kind of established season 3/4 that Korra isn't necessary for the world to rebuild. The air nation is off superheroing, the world leaders are competent, and Varrick is still there to help with infrastructure building. Those two are important, but not wholly necessary. \n\nSo how is this the best resolution for the show? Perhaps it's not, but I think it's still a good one. We have Korra's spiritual growth already established with her connection to the vines, her meditating in and out of the spirit world pretty much at will, her control of the avatar state. We have her personal growth already shown in her actually planning things out with the others instead of just rushing in swinging, working with them as a team instead of flying in solo, and feeling true empathy for Kuvira instead of the pure hatred and fear she felt for Amon and Zaheer. Her arcs were complete. And I think a break for Korra after 4 seasons of the shit she had to put up with is well-deserved. \n\nAnd who is she going to spend some time with? Mako, her ex? Bolin who's just been reunited with Opal? Tenzin who has a family and civic responsibilities? The Beifongs who just were reunited as a family? Varrick who just got married? Or is she going to go with her best friend who just lost her father? She could go alone, but I think Korra has had enough alone time this season.\n\nI hope this wasn't too long, and I hope it was all clear. Please ask more questions if I need to clarify."}, {"id": "2q5zwb", "body": "**HELLO! IF YOU'RE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA, LIKE, WHY? YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SPOILERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.**\n\nOkay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe I'm just closed-minded and white cisgendered homophobic (I hope I'm not, but hey). But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and \"ambiguous\" they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.\n\nugh...\n\n**Please, change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a \"main\" character is the best possible resolution for the show.** I want to love this show again. I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldn't hear it, so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. \n\nI refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to \"okay now we want you to hate the show so we don't have to do more\". I want to see the light, dammit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I don't care that they're les or bi or what the fuck ever. I hate that my opinion is automatically devalued as \"HOMOFOB NOOOOO\" by the vast majority of the ATLA and ALOK subreddits, not to even mention Tumblr.\n\nSorry this is long.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

How is she going to justify taking me time when there's so much work to do? Aang had successfully defeated the Phoenix King and nations had to reunite and regroup naturally. Roku existed before the war even started, and said himself that had he been more decisive the war wouldn't have happened at all and all the Airbenders would still be alive. \n\n&gt;You sort of seem like your grasping for straws here.\n\nN-no you."}, {"id": "cn58fei", "body": "&gt; And if we wanted to get semantic? Shipping isn't writing two characters \"finding love\", it's writing two characters to make out/fuck each other rule 34 fanfiction style. Not to sit down and have a picnic and express just how much they love each other like a relationship, and not even to have sex or make love, but to fuck.\n\nHave you experienced much of what goes on in communities built around ships? Sure there is some rule34 and some smutty fanfic. But that stuff is the minority of stuff. Most of a shipping community is built around the idea that these two characters should be in love. Go look at the korrasami sub, it has a no smut rule, and its not an empty sub, or lacking of content because of that rule. \n\nrule34 exists in spite of shipping. Anything will be turned to smut, not everything will have a active shipping community. "}, {"id": "cn383m5", "body": "&gt;I don't see what you're getting at here. Because Korra is \"strong\", she can't ever be in a relationship? That makes no sense. She clearly showed interest in Mako for the first season and a half - she isn't some robot who never loves anyone.\n\nI guess what I meant is that her being with someone feels really, I dunno, gender roll-y and non-avatary, I guess, for lack of better term. Korra was independent for two-and-a-half full seasons, to the point where romance was completely unimportant to her. Why was it suddenly, on the eve of her victory, the most important thing to focus on? \n\nLike, Aang fell in love with Katara immediately and had these cute, puppy dog moments every so often, which was fine because they were played as cute. Korra's love felt rushed and last-minute, and was even confirmed by Bryke to not have been \"endgame\" when they were planning the series.\n\n&gt;Are you seriously calling Asami a minor character?\n\nOh come on. Besides occasionally knocking out bad guys, what major plot contributions did Asami have outside the first season? She drove the fucking car. She came up with the flying whatever machines, with Verrick. She got Korra out of confinement once, only to land them in the desert. She was present, sure, but could the plot not have continued without her? She was the token non bender of the party, really.\n\n&gt;I would definitely disagree on you about that, but it's irrelevant. It doesn't matter how much she appeared in the show, she and Korra obviously had meaningful interactions from at least season 3 onwards, if not before.\n\nThis was the disconnect for me, I guess, thinking about it. They did had meaningful interactions, but so did every other character. Tenzin, Mako, Bolin, her Dad, Aang, Toph, Lin, even Tarrlok, Amon, and Zaheer all had meaningful interactions with Korra, but they meant nothing! But because the finale decided they were together, they became *meaningful* meaningful interactions. Like, if it were Makorra, I could go back and find like 20 \"meaningful interactions\" that foreshadowed the finale.\n\n&gt;What defines fanservice? Is it anything in the show that the fans would enjoy? Is it paying too much attention to shippers? Every show has moments where the shippers get it right, or the show does something that seems to be for the fans sakes, but is it really something to get so upset about?\n\nIt's less about \"lol shippers got it right\" and more about how it wasn't that situation until it was at the very end because lol shippers. That's what I meant: It was an easily avoidable subject but because shippers (and not even necessarily shippers, but a weird authorial urge to give this \"perfectly capable of being on her own\" character sexuality and need for a partner), the ending was the way it was.\n\n&gt;It wasn't the \"objective worst ending\", and to say so shows that you've ignored everything else that happened both in the series and the finale itself.\n\nOff the top of my head, some of the ways it could have gone down:\n\n1. Korra loses, dies. Dark, sure. Hard to deal with? Yeah. Good writing? Absolutely. \n\n2. Kuvira loses, dies. Korra asks Tenzin for guidance. Closes on ambiguous \"the future is ahead\" bullshit quote.\n\n3. Kuvira loses, loses honorably. Same events happen, but Korra talks to literally any other character at the end than Asami. They offer their wisdom. Look into the sunset. End.\n\n4. Kuvira wins, but uprising survives. Ambiguous ending, sure, but not bad.\n\n5. Kuvira loses, loses honorably. Same events happen, but Korra talks to Asami. Sorry about, you know, the Mako thing and the Hiroshi thing, and the \"left for 3 years\" thing. Thanks for sticking by me. Best friends.\n\nAny of those endings that I just invented would have wrapped the show up better because it would have indicated they weren't just ignoring all of the things left unresolved.\n\n&gt;In fact, I would have been more uncomfortable if Mako and Korra had got back together, because they had clearly overcome the awkwardness of the end of their last relationship, and had moved on from one another.\n\nThat's what I mean; why does she have to be sexualized? I was totally fine with her being stoic and badass, as were apparently focus groups when they first planned to make her a girl. \n\n&gt;it quite clearly doesn't invalidate Korra's development, nor is it the worst it could have been. \n\nBut why did she need to need someone?

Best friends.\n\nAny of those endings that I just invented would have wrapped the show up better because it would have indicated they weren't just ignoring all of the things left unresolved.\n\n&gt;In fact, I would have been more uncomfortable if Mako and Korra had got back together, because they had clearly overcome the awkwardness of the end of their last relationship, and had moved on from one another.\n\nThat's what I mean; why does she have to be sexualized? I was totally fine with her being stoic and badass, as were apparently focus groups when they first planned to make her a girl. \n\n&gt;it quite clearly doesn't invalidate Korra's development, nor is it the worst it could have been. \n\nBut why did she need to need someone? She evolved past that in the first/second seasons!

The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra.

Korra and Asami literally go on Vaca at the end of the series, letting the human world deal with its own crazy political horseshit on its own, as well as, um, letting them all do their own repairs and prevent their own crime for who knows how long. That's a little in the way of her Avatar duties. And god knows how difficult it'll be not having someone who communicates with spirit vines to help with repairs.\n\n&gt;All that said, pairing Korra with someone romantically doesn't make her not a strong and independant woman.

That's what I meant: It was an easily avoidable subject but because shippers (and not even necessarily shippers, but a weird authorial urge to give this \"perfectly capable of being on her own\" character sexuality and need for a partner), the ending was the way it was. That's what I meant by fanservice.\n\n&gt;Did you even watch Book 3? Korra and Asami spent something like 85% of that season together. Asami was a pretty important character even back in book 1! And while she was pushed to the sideline in book 2 she came back with a bang and is just as part of the krew as Bolin.\n\nOh come on. Besides occasionally knocking out bad guys, what major plot contributions did Asami have outside the first season? She drove the fucking car. She came up with the flying whatever machines, with Verrick. She got Korra out of confinement once, only to land them in the desert. She was present, sure, but could the plot not have continued without her? She was the token non bender of the party, really. Also, is \"krew\" the official term? I was just using Team Avatar, seems to be the catch-all.\n\n&gt;But really, why is pairing up a main character with a minor one (not that Asami was, mind) bad fiction? Should main character romantic interests only involve other main characters or something?\n\nSee next point.\n\n&gt;If you think that relationship was rushed y'all need to rewatch the 3rd and 4th books. Korra and Asami go from friends to best friends to clearly something more by the end. It's slow and building the entire time.\n\nNot necessarily, but they sure as hell shouldn't come the fuck out of left field in the last three minutes of the plot. See, the thing is, they did had meaningful interactions, but so did every other character. Tenzin, Mako, Bolin, her Dad, Aang, Toph, Lin, even Tarrlok, Amon, and Zaheer all had meaningful interactions with Korra, but they meant nothing! But because the finale decided they were together, they became meaningful meaningful interactions. Like, if it were Makorra, I could go back and find like 20 \"meaningful interactions\" that foreshadowed the finale. There was no reason to believe that it was happening until it happened.\n\n&gt;Korra was a very headstrong Avatar and thought that the best way out of any situation was to punch it to death. And how does she defeat all of her enemies? Amon - punches. \n\nDesperation punches. \n\n&gt;Unnavaatu - spirit punches. \n\nJenora Christ.\n\n&gt;Zaheer - Avatar State punches. \n\nEh, I call that teamwork, and desperation again.\n\n&gt;Kuvira - saving her life, and talking about their common traits.Kuvira was just about as strong a bender as a non-Avatar can get. She was able to hold her own against Korra and even got the upper hand when she fired the cannon. It was clear that this wasnt a problem Korra was going to be able to punch herself out of. By saving Kuvira's life and by talking to her in the spirit world Korra was able to single-handedly dismantle the Earth Empire. Do you think those dudes in the mechs would have stood down if Korra walked out of there carrying Kuvira's body? I don't.\n\nThis is a good point, and I agree. I thoroughly enjoyed this resolution, but I definitely feel like she wasn't a threat anymore and imagine Korra saw this. Remember, she was a good guy who got a little overzealous. And she was probably tied with Amon for the \"Most Right Villain\" award. Hell, I bet Korra would visit her. She did, you know, reunite the earth kingdom for the most part and basically rid it of looting/rioting/thieves. If it weren't for the \"DO IT OR ELSE\" part, and the internment camp thing, she'd have made a great Great Uniter. \n\n&gt;The Last Airbender was the story of an Airbender named Aang becoming the Avatar. The Legend of Korra is about an Avatar named Korra becoming the woman she is on the inside. She was no longer defining herself by her title, and has started to live life.\n\nFair enough. I honestly don't care that she got a girl, more power to her dude. God knows I'll like the fan art, haha. But what I'm saying is does it have to be the note we end on? Is there nothing more pressing to do or say, or spotlight? What happens to Toph? What happens to the world now? Why doesn't Tenzin get a better resolution than being a joke at the end?

Tenzin, Mako, Bolin, her Dad, Aang, Toph, Lin, even Tarrlok, Amon, and Zaheer all had meaningful interactions with Korra, but they meant nothing!

She was able to hold her own against Korra and even got the upper hand when she fired the cannon. It was clear that this wasnt a problem Korra was going to be able to punch herself out of. By saving Kuvira's life and by talking to her in the spirit world Korra was able to single-handedly dismantle the Earth Empire.

The entire point of season 4 is her overcoming those internal demons - for half the season she is literally haunted by her shadowy doppelganger!  She really wasn't in a good place, emotionally, to date before she figured herself out.

But she left at a crucial time for the earth kingdom. Wu was going to employ his new political strategy at the same time Republic City, Zaofu, Ba Sing Se, and the rest of the earth kingdom were still reeling in the light of Giant Platinum Machine's Plot Laser Cannon. The earth kingdom is teetering, so how about a day off?\n\n&gt;Aang went on vacations with Tenzin to try and preserve his culture and he did that in addition to being an Avatar.\n\nAgain, during a time of peace though.\n\n&gt;Korra changed the world in a big way, and now yeah everyone else can deal with the aftermath and the issues surrounding it.\n\nThat's selfish and not like the avatar at all. The Avatar is a figurehead as the most important and powerful bender in the world. If she leaves and lets everyone else deal, there's gonna be a rash of people. coming forward like \"Where were you when bandits killed my daughter?!\" And \"My house was destroyed and me and my nonbender family lost everything! Why didn't you help us?\"\n\n&gt;Again, the Avatar is a human first, Avatar second\n\nI disagree wholeheartedly. Aang dedicated his life to being avatar because it was who he was and he was told by many people he couldn't have a normal life because of it. Even his past lives told him he had to let go of earthly tethers like Katara and any hope of leading a \"normal life\". Fair? No. Necessary? Maybe. But that's the way it has to be or there's major consequences. I mean, look at what happened globally when Korra was gone for three years on recovery! A fascist rose to power and had hold of most of the world!\n\n&gt;She set pursuit of a relationship aside after Mako, but I think we all know that relationships tend to happen when you're not looking.\n\nMaybe romcoms aren't my cup of tea. Well, not maybe, I'm sure they aren't. \n\n&gt;I hope you misspoke when you said Korra was \"sexualized\" here. As she was not sexualized at all! \n\nMaybe sexualized was the wrong word. She was made to require a partner, which I disagree with based on her previous character choices because it makes no sense that someone relationships are so unimportant to would need or even want one.\n\n&gt;Korra didn't *need* to end up with anyone, you're right about that. But she did. And I don't see how this detracts from the narrative at all. It's the Legend of Korra, and part of that legend was her finding love in a friend.\n\nIt counteracts a few seasons of her establishing she didn't need a partner to be important/relevant, to be the Avatar, or even to be happy on a personal level.

The earth kingdom is teetering, so how about a day off?\n\nI agree that the world is in turmoil, but I think part of Korra's arc was leaning that the state of the world *isn't her problem*. The world will keep on keeping on without her (as it did when she was suffering). She knows that there's Raiko and Tenzin and Tonroq and Zuko's daughter to set the world right in this aftermath. She's deserved a break, and she's no politician or should be in charge of how countries recover! She's just there to keep balance, and so she does.\n\n&gt; Again, during a time of peace though.\n\nTrue enough, but this is enough of peace for her to take a break. I didn't leave the finale thinking the world was still in peril. There's still some pieces to pick up, but Su and the others seem capable enough to do that. And it isn't like Korra is gone forever.\n\n&gt; That's selfish and not like the avatar at all. The Avatar is a figurehead as the most important and powerful bender in the world.

Why didn't you help us?\"\n\nThose people don't understand the role of the Avatar. She isn't superman, trying to save everyone all the time. Sometimes people die, or sometimes people do terrible things. Korra can't stop them all, she never could.\n\n&gt; I disagree wholeheartedly. Aang dedicated his life to being avatar because it was who he was and he was told by many people he couldn't have a normal life because of it. Even his past lives told him he had to let go of earthly tethers like Katara and any hope of leading a \"normal life\". Fair? No. Necessary? Maybe.

A fascist rose to power and had hold of most of the world!\n\nAang dedicated his life to restoring the Air Nation's culture. And yeah, some bad things happened while Korra was gone, but the Avatar isn't meant to be savior of everything, she's just meant to try and keep balance.\n\nLook at it this way, usually Avatars aren't told they're the Avatar until 16, right? That's when they start training on the other elements. How long does that take? Quite a few years I'd imagine (not all Avatars have to learn the elements in a year like Aang, and it's implied Roku took quite some time). That means the world is periodically without an Avatar for years at a time and it still manages.\n\nThe Avatar lives in the human world, the humans don't live in the Avatar's world.\n\n&gt; Maybe sexualized was the wrong word. She was made to require a partner, which I disagree with based on her previous character choices because it makes no sense that someone relationships are so unimportant to would need or even want one.\n\nKorra is still human and likes relationships. The Avatar falls in love, it's happened before and it'll happen again. Without Avatars falling in love, we have no Zuko, no Tenzin, no Ikki!\n\n&gt; It counteracts a few seasons of her establishing she didn't need a partner to be important/relevant, to be the Avatar, or even to be happy on a personal level. Why does she suddenly want Asami?\n\nI don't think it was so sudden, again - you ought to rewatch book 3 and 4! But what we saw at the end of Book 4 wasn't the middle of their relationship, it was the beginning. She *was* happy on a personal level, and it allowed her to see the love around her.\n\nKorra wasn't a big fan of relationships, sure. But that doesn't mean she would have never been in one! She and Asami fell in love, and I imagine Korra and Asami were just as surprised as you.\n\n&gt; Interesting. I call them the Gaang.\n\nI like the Fearsome Foursome.\n\n&gt; I felt like she was largely forgettable until it was convenient for the plot. Korra needs encouragement and Tenzin is teaching air bending? Korra need a rescue? Korra needs a ride somewhere? Asami. She knocked out maybe like 4 people in the last two seasons, leading to her being forgettable for me. Maybe that's on me.\n\nWatch 'em again, because he strength isn't in her fighting. She's a lot like Sokka. She thinks on her feet and helps people out.\n\n&gt; That's a really good point. If anything were gonna change my view it'd be this.

Humans have sexualities and get involved romantically. She set pursuit of a relationship aside after Mako, but I think we all know that relationships tend to happen when you're not looking. She and Asami ended up spending a lot of time together and became each other's support systems and that budded into love.\n\nI hope you misspoke when you said Korra was \"sexualized\" here.

That's what I meant: It was an easily avoidable subject but because shippers (and not even necessarily shippers, but a weird authorial urge to give this \"perfectly capable of being on her own\" character sexuality and need for a partner), the ending was the way it was. That's what I meant by fanservice.\n\nI frankly didn't see any of that, and if you read Bryan's response to this whole thing he addresses this notion directly. Korra didn't *need* to end up with anyone, you're right about that. But she did. And I don't see how this detracts from the narrative at all. It's the Legend of Korra, and part of that legend was her finding love in a friend.\n\n&gt; Oh come on. Besides occasionally knocking out bad guys, what major plot contributions did Asami have outside the first season? She drove the fucking car. She came up with the flying whatever machines, with Verrick. She got Korra out of confinement once, only to land them in the desert. She was present, sure, but could the plot not have continued without her? She was the token non bender of the party, really. Also, is \"krew\" the official term?

She was a constant companion to Korra the entire time and while she didn't have a whole lot to do at the climax (four incredibly powerful benders going up against a nonbender) she was still there for Korra.\n\nThen in book 4 she had entire storylines that were just her own. Nobody else had an arc with her father!\n\n&gt; Not necessarily, but they sure as hell shouldn't come the fuck out of left field in the last three minutes of the plot. See, the thing is, they did had meaningful interactions, but so did every other character. Tenzin, Mako, Bolin, her Dad, Aang, Toph, Lin, even Tarrlok, Amon, and Zaheer all had meaningful interactions with Korra, but they meant nothing! But because the finale decided they were together, they became meaningful meaningful interactions. Like, if it were Makorra, I could go back and find like 20 \"meaningful interactions\" that foreshadowed the finale. There was no reason to believe that it was happening until it happened.\n\nExcept when they broke up and said they were done - sure. Im suggesting you rewatch books 3 and 4 here, because it's pretty clear something is going on between Korra and Asami. Mako even asks about it when they go to dinner with Wu. Check out the scene where they're both captured by the Earth Queen's forces and the look Asami gives Korra when she comes back from the spirit world.\n\nI didn't think Korrasami was ever going to be a thing until book 3.\n\n&gt; This is a good point, and I agree. I thoroughly enjoyed this resolution, but I definitely feel like she wasn't a threat anymore and imagine Korra saw this. Remember, she was a good guy who got a little overzealous. And she was probably tied with Amon for the \"Most Right Villain\" award. Hell, I bet Korra would visit her. She did, you know, reunite the earth kingdom for the most part and basically rid it of looting/rioting/thieves. If it weren't for the \"DO IT OR ELSE\" part, and the internment camp thing, she'd have made a great Great Uniter.\n\nRight, Kuvira was an example of how power can corrupt, and it's no wonder that Korra saw a lot of herself in Kuvira.\n\n&gt; Fair enough. I honestly don't care that she got a girl, more power to her dude. God knows I'll like the fan art, haha. But what I'm saying is does it have to be the note we end on? Is there nothing more pressing to do or say, or spotlight? What happens to Toph? What happens to the world now? Why doesn't Tenzin get a better resolution than being a joke at the end? I just--you know? I wanted more!\n\nI think we all wanted more. But I enjoyed the Legend of Korra ending on such a personal note for the titular character.

Im suggesting you rewatch books 3 and 4 here, because it's pretty clear something is going on between Korra and Asami. Mako even asks about it when they go to dinner with Wu.

I thoroughly enjoyed this resolution, but I definitely feel like she wasn't a threat anymore and imagine Korra saw this. Remember, she was a good guy who got a little overzealous. And she was probably tied with Amon for the \"Most Right Villain\" award. Hell, I bet Korra would visit her. She did, you know, reunite the earth kingdom for the most part and basically rid it of looting/rioting/thieves.

Is there nothing more pressing to do or say, or spotlight? What happens to Toph? What happens to the world now? Why doesn't Tenzin get a better resolution than being a joke at the end? I just--you know? I wanted more!\n\nI think we all wanted more. But I enjoyed the Legend of Korra ending on such a personal note for the titular character. It was a reminder that this was Korra's story - not the story of how the world changed. The Last Airbender ended with Aang and Katara's kiss. Both series have ended with a humanized Avatar.

That's a little in the way of her Avatar duties. And god knows how difficult it'll be not having someone who communicates with spirit vines to help with repairs.\n\nIs the Avatar not allowed a vacation? The Avatar is, above all else, a human individual. And anyone with that kind of power probably needs some time to blow off some steam. Aang went on vacations with Tenzin to try and preserve his culture and he did that in addition to being an Avatar.\n\nKorea changed the world in a big way, and now yeah everyone else can deal with the aftermath and the issues surrounding it.\n\n&gt; Fair enough, maybe it wasn't codependent. It's just, I guess I'm confused as to why Bryce decided to inevitably sexualize Korra when it was unnecessary to. She was independent and completely nonromantic for two and a half seasons because she was the Avatar and needed to be, why does that change all of a sudden now?!\n\nAgain, the Avatar is a human first, Avatar second - and this was basically what Korra's series-long arc was all about. Humans have sexualities and get involved romantically. She set pursuit of a relationship aside after Mako, but I think we all know that relationships tend to happen when you're not looking. She and Asami ended up spending a lot of time together and became each other's support systems and that budded into love.\n\nI hope you misspoke when you said Korra was \"sexualized\" here. As she was not sexualized at all! A scene of Korra and Asami making out would have been sexualizing her - not holding hands and looking into each other's eyes.\n\n&gt; It's less about \"lol shippers got it right\" and more about how it wasn't that situation until it was at the very end because lol shippers. That's what I meant: It was an easily avoidable subject but because shippers (and not even necessarily shippers, but a weird authorial urge to give this \"perfectly capable of being on her own\" character sexuality and need for a partner), the ending was the way it was. That's what I meant by fanservice.\n\nI frankly didn't see any of that, and if you read Bryan's response to this whole thing he addresses this notion directly. Korra didn't *need* to end up with anyone, you're right about that. But she did. And I don't see how this detracts from the narrative at all. It's the Legend of Korra, and part of that legend was her finding love in a friend.\n\n&gt; Oh come on. Besides occasionally knocking out bad guys, what major plot contributions did Asami have outside the first season? She drove the fucking car. She came up with the flying whatever machines, with Verrick. She got Korra out of confinement once, only to land them in the desert. She was present, sure, but could the plot not have continued without her? She was the token non bender of the party, really. Also, is \"krew\" the official term? I was just using Team Avatar, seems to be the catch-all.\n\nI prefer krew because it's shorter and I think of Aang's group as Team Avatar.\n\nAsami helped Mako do detective stuff in book 2 but was largely ignored. But in book 3 she got Korra out of the oasis place on Naga, she got them out of the Earth Queen's captivity, she then rescued Korra and the airship crew from the desert. She was a constant companion to Korra the entire time and while she didn't have a whole lot to do at the climax (four incredibly powerful benders going up against a nonbender) she was still there for Korra.\n\nThen in book 4 she had entire storylines that were just her own. Nobody else had an arc with her father!\n\n&gt; Not necessarily, but they sure as hell shouldn't come the fuck out of left field in the last three minutes of the plot. See, the thing is, they did had meaningful interactions, but so did every other character. Tenzin, Mako, Bolin, her Dad, Aang, Toph, Lin, even Tarrlok, Amon, and Zaheer all had meaningful interactions with Korra, but they meant nothing!

Where are they being sexualized?  I mean obviously relationships have sex, but it's not like they delved into that.  They didn't even show them kissing, like they did with Mako.  This is the least sexualization they could have done.\n\nAnd yeah, she was relationship-less for like 3 years.  Most of that time was spent in between season 3 and 4, when she was on that introspective journey after Zaheer poisoned her.  No shit she was \"independent\" at the time, there was noone around her.  Yet she clearly missed her fiends (mainly Asami, as Asami was the one she wrote to).  Also, the Avatar can still have a romantic life (see Kuruk, Roku, Aang).\n\nAnother important point there is that Korra's main struggle was one of identity.  She was told that she was the Avatar from a young age, and being the Avatar was her whole life (note that the first words she says in the series are, \"I'm the Avatar and you've gotta deal with it!\").  She never had an identity outside of being the Avatar.  All of the enemies she faced up to Book 4 attacked her sense as the Avatar.

Just because someone has a sexuality, it doesn't make them sexualized. If Korra is sexualized for falling in love with a woman, then Aang is sexualized for falling in love with Katara.

IF YOU'RE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA, LIKE, WHY? YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SPOILERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.**\n\nOkay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe I'm just closed-minded and white cisgendered homophobic (I hope I'm not, but hey). But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and \"ambiguous\" they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.\n\nugh...\n\n**Please, change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a \"main\" character is the best possible resolution for the show.** I want to love this show again. I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldn't hear it, so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. \n\nI refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to \"okay now we want you to hate the show so we don't have to do more\". I want to see the light, dammit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I don't care that they're les or bi or what the fuck ever. I hate that my opinion is automatically devalued as \"HOMOFOB NOOOOO\" by the vast majority of the ATLA and ALOK subreddits, not to even mention Tumblr.\n\nSorry this is long.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Not sure what series you watched, but Asami is *not* a minor character. She's very clearly established as part of Legend of Korra's \"Team Avatar\". She was a main character in all 4 seasons, and had a boatload of 1:1 team up action with Korra in Season 3 in particular (remember when she busted them out of airship jail and then built them a new ride from the damaged parts?) I'm puzzled why you consider her \"seemingly minor\" while you don't seem to have a problem considering Mako an important character, even though his season 4 arc was pretty much a glorified baby sitting job for Prince Wu.\n\n&gt; To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice\n\nI'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word \"seemingly\" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all. But you reiterate the notion again when you say:\n\n&gt; Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl).\n\nI don't understand at all the notion that Korra's relationship (however you choose to interpret it) in any way takes away from her strength or independence. Like, I honestly don't get what you're getting at here. How does Korra wanting a relationship (and actively pursuing what she wanted - *Korra* had the idea for them to take a trip together) make her any less strong? I have a wife that I love. Would you consider me a \"stronger\" person if I were single? I just don't get it.\n\n&gt; The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. \n\nLook, I don't want to play at the foreshadowing / when did they decide this game, because we're not the writers, but I honestly feel like you just haven't been paying attention during seasons 3 and 4. Korra very clearly started to establish *some kind* of special friendship with Asami early in Season 3. The extent to which there were romantic undertones can be debated, but some sort of unique relationship was clearly there. If you disagree with this, I don't know what to say other than to go back and rewatch the show. This relationship continued (and became more complicated) when Korra was poisoned and there was a mail correspondence (or rather *non* correspondence), and then when they reunited at the restaurant with Mako and Wu. I do feel that as a character, she got crowded out a bit in the second half of season 4 by Varrick/Zhu Li in terms of plot contributions, but as far as her relationship with Korra, that's neither here nor there. Anyway, no I don't think this came out of left field as you say, and if you go back and rewatch the series, I think you'll have a tough time defending that assertion.\n\nAs for a \"resolution\" to the series, I'm not sure what you want. Kuvira's storyline was wrapped up with a bow (and a pair of handcuffs). Wu has a plan for the future of the Earth kingdom (not sure what more you wanted to see there). The air nation was season 3's storyline. Its been back for three years. Again, what more are you looking for? Varrick/Zhu Li were married, so their arc is wrapped up. Bolin's story was taking a stand and winning back Opal, which was already resolved nicely (with him earning the trust of the beifong sisters as well.) Mako didn't have much of a season 4 arc, which is why his pseudo \"self sacrifice\" felt awkward and forced to me, but I guess he can take some credit for turning Wu into less of a dope. Asami didn't have a ton to do in Season 4 compared to earlier seasons, but when she was onscreen, her focuses were building trains and robots (check) and her relationships with her father (check) and Korra (checkmate, whether you noticed it or not). As for Korra, she overcame her physical and emotional roadblocks. Maybe you think the last few minutes could have been better spent, but I just don't see all these dangling loose plot threads that you do.\n\nAnd if there's one thing I know about Korra, its that she doesn't give a shit what you think.

IF YOU'RE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA, LIKE, WHY? YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SPOILERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.**\n\nOkay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe I'm just closed-minded and white cisgendered homophobic (I hope I'm not, but hey). But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and \"ambiguous\" they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.\n\nugh...\n\n**Please, change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a \"main\" character is the best possible resolution for the show.** I want to love this show again. I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldn't hear it, so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. \n\nI refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to \"okay now we want you to hate the show so we don't have to do more\". I want to see the light, dammit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I don't care that they're les or bi or what the fuck ever.

She was in the main four but of them she was by far the least important.

If not, how often was she crucial?

Big time.\n\n&gt;As you stated in your reasoning, you hate those pushers. I feel like maybe without that experience or even knowledge that this was a ship, you might have felt less harsh about this ending. You may have still disliked it but perhaps not to the extent that you dislike it here. So those comments coloured your viewing.\n\nMaybe. I still would have felt strongly about it but maybe if it weren't for the people who agree with me (if there are any) being effectively silenced by massive downvotes I wouldn't have needed some sort of vindication or discourse, so I wouldn't have come here.\n\n&gt;That and I hate when people say romance devalues a character. It's not like Korra nor Asami were reduced to romantic objects, both are fleshed out characters with a purpose and complex personalities. \n\nThat's the pole though. Like, the absolute negative. I don't necessarily believe that. I mean, all of the character development she had when she and Amon were talking about weakness is still there, all of her and Tenzins stuff, etc. I do believe it did make her cheaper of a character.\n\n&gt;Also, you seem to dislike Asami's character and like to relegate her to the background. She's the group's brain but she is her own person. \n\nMaybe, but only when it's convenient to Team Avatar that she be. She is very forgettable as a nonbender and as someone seemingly left over from Season 1's resolution, and she did subjectively very little in the wars against Unalaq, Zaheer, and Kuvira that others couldn't have done themselves. Korra, Tenzin, and even Varrick at times were the real brains of the operation in S4, but when they weren't around it was Asami, fine.\n\n&gt;she has played huge roles in the show. \n\nAgain, I disagree with this. She was in the main four but of them she was by far the least important. Many of the people not in the main 4 were far more important than her, including characters with far fewer episodes (Korra's dad, Ghost!Aang) and far smaller parts (Raava/Vatu, even arguably Varrick in season 2 because he's inspired to build the Spirit Cannon)\n\n&gt;I don't exactly know what your standard is for main character though so maybe some clarification on that.\n\nCould the plot have resolved itself without her intervention? If not, how often was she crucial? She had motivational speeches and pats on the back throughout, but you could have her disappear after really S1 and others could realistically take her place.\n\n&gt;If those laws did not exist I'm sure you would have seen more of a build up and conclusion. So some of your point is right, the build up is little next to none but it is there. \n\nIt wasn't enough for me, which is why it felt forced. Maybe it's my own fault because hah heteronormativity and I'll acknowledge that, but maybe they could have tried to have been a little less subtle. Get more stuff past the radar. I know it completely blindsided me at least.\n\n"}, {"id": "cn47jdl", "body": "Okay, so I have two points I want to make. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with love or romance. Being in love with someone doesn't make you weaker nor more reliant on another being. Being attached to someone, wanting to be around them, there's nothing wrong with that. Being comfortable around someone, being happy with someone, those are good things. \n\nI understand where you're coming from when you say that you think romance cheapens a character. We get an excess of forced romances in our media, in Disney, in Rom Coms, in almost every other show, I do get it. Especially for women. Women are very often put into plots just as a love interest for the main character.\n\nHOWEVER, in Legend of Korra that's not the case. Korra has a plotline. She has several. She has a background, she learns lessons, she's complex, and she's amazing. She's not reduced to a love interest in the end, if anything she's incredibly lucky that she has managed to find someone that she finds completely wonderful, relaxing, and exciting all at the same time. Her romance is more of an added bonus than a reduction.\n\nAs for Asami, Asami is much more important than you think. She understands Korra. And in that understanding, she has helped Korra more than a large majority of the other characters have. \n\nFor example, I have many great friends. I love them all. I think they're great and funny and fun to hang out with. But my closest friend, she's my kin. She and I get along on a different level. We relate to each other, we understand each others' emotions, when we're together we can relax and be ourselves and talk about any shit that comes to our mind. If I believed in the soul, I would say we had a spiritual connection.\n\nWithout her, life would be worse. I don't have that kind of connection with anybody else. I know she feels the same, I can feel that she does. We mutually inspire each other to live. Sure we live for our (luckily) wonderful friends and family and ourselves as well but we thrive for each other. We're actually not romantically involved but if it did happen, which it could, it'd both be a surprise and not be a surprise to the ones around us. We don't giggle and flirt, we just do as we would.\n\nThat's what Asami is to Korra. Asami is her lifeblood. Asami is her confidant. Asami understands Korra so deeply that their connection is on a different level than their other friends. It's not that Korra doesn't love deeply her other friends and it's not that Korra relies on Asami. Asami enhances her life. Sure Korra could do the story line without her but it'd be more difficult and I believe she'd have even more emotional stress without her.\n\nShe wrote to Asami after all of those years because she felt she could talk to her. That's invaluable. She couldn't write to Tenzin or Mako or Bolin because she knew what they would say and she knew that while they meant well it wouldn't help. She felt that Asami would not only understand but also be able to help her.\n\nIf you re-watch Book 3 and Book 4, you will notice that Asami spends a lot more time at Korra's side. She's not just building things (like robots, weapons, roads, and tracks) and she's not just having her own emotional if brief side-plot (poor Hiroshi, brought up just to be knocked down again), she's there for Korra. If you watch closely you can actually see her anticipating Korra's moves and working quite flawlessly with her (the animators are astounding at this).\n\nThe pushers do push that every little interaction is a hint and sometimes they push too far in their excitement but in a lot of cases they aren't wrong. What may seem benign for some is actually a small moment for those two. A look, a touch, a hug that lingers. Maybe the others don't see it but I'm certain that the characters could feel it. It's almost like you need an animated heart meter on the side of the screen so you could watch it race.\n\nYou say she's not important unless it's convenient to the plot? I think you're missing her emotional impact on Korra. It's subtle, very subtle, but it is there. That and Asami has her own life without Korra. She helped design some of the roadwork and the tracks for a city for fuck's sake. She's a business woman who invents. She's amazingly brilliant! She can fight, build, and think. She's patient and she didn't blame Korra for her Mako troubles, she blamed Mako. That's already subverting many tropes. A small thing that's great.\n\nYou say it cheapens their characters, I say it helps them grow. It's wonderful to have someone who supports and understands you. Their romance at the end may catch people not looking by surprise but to them it was natural. It's a progression. And aside from that, at the end of the series their relationship is just beginning. They're just starting to date not ready to get married yet.\n\nThey are tentatively starting a new journey with each other and I think that's great.\n\nI think I got my whole point in there. Keep in mind that where I am it's 8:00AM and I got up at 6:00AM to work at 7:00AM. If I missed something or misspelled something or even misconstrued something, I apologize in advance. "}, {"id": "2q5zwb", "body": "**HELLO! IF YOU'RE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA, LIKE, WHY? YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SPOILERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.**\n\nOkay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe I'm just closed-minded and white cisgendered homophobic (I hope I'm not, but hey). But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and \"ambiguous\" they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.\n\nugh...\n\n**Please, change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a \"main\" character is the best possible resolution for the show.** I want to love this show again. I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldn't hear it, so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. \n\nI refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to \"okay now we want you to hate the show so we don't have to do more\". I want to see the light, dammit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I don't care that they're les or bi or what the fuck ever.

She chased Mako pretty hard in season one, and there was a lot of screen time in season two devoted to that relationship (and it's eventual failure).

IF YOU'RE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA, LIKE, WHY? YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SPOILERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT.

But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?!

I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season.

Maybe I'm just closed-minded and white cisgendered homophobic (I hope I'm not, but hey). But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and \"ambiguous\" they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.\n\nugh...\n\n**Please, change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a \"main\" character is the best possible resolution for the show.** I want to love this show again. I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season.

Speed limits are:\n\n- Cars 70mph\n\n- Vehicles with trailers 60mph\n\n- Heavy Goods Vehicles 50mph\n\nUsing your logic on a 2 lane dual carriageway, a lorry doing 50mph in one lane and a lorry doing 50mph in the other lane is perfectly legal since they're both respecting the law, however other traffic cannot move past. This forces you to travel at the HGV speed limit, not your own. This causes traffic, which is one of the reasons we have multiple lanes. \n\nAnother reason is emergency services - if you're sat in the outer lane doing the same speed as the drivers in the inner lane and there's a full lane of traffic there, you're actively holding up the ambulance/fire engine/police.\n\nAside from all of this, the most blaringly obvious point is if you're doing the same speed as the traffic in the inner lane, there's no reason for you to be in the outer lane!

However in rural areas, since there are less cars, laws and social etiquette has mandated that traffic should generally keep in the right lane unless passing. Why? This keeps everyone moving as efficiently as possible. Slower vehicles such as trucks stick to the right while faster traffic can pass on the left. If this were not the case, we would have people impeding upon the flow of faster traffic.\n\nThis arrangement holds precedent over legal speed limits, for safety reasons. In essence you are not supposed to serve as a vigilante to enforce others' driving speeds. I will use your robber/theft analogy. Yes, driving the speed limit in the left lane (and impeding faster flowing traffic) is equivalent to resisting a robbery attempt. But instead of one robber there are dozens (dozens of cars lined up behind you). You are helpless; resisting would be a bad option, since you risk being in danger. You can either:\n\n1) Go with it, and don't resist. This is equivalent to speeding up to match the speed of traffic in the left lane (exceeding the speed limit). It would be \"wrong\", but nobody would get hurt (it'd be safer than blocking traffic flow)\n\nOr\n\n2) Step into a portal to safety escape the robbery. This is equivalent to changing into the right lane (while maintaining the speed limit, as you prefer) and letting them pass.

The system is designed such that, for roads that are not at capacity, slower vehicles remain to the right and passing occurs to the left. This is universal, this is what people expect, and it keeps multi-lane highways from becoming an unmitigated free-for-all. People know that when merging to the left they're entering a lane with potentially faster traffic and give due diligence to checking behind, to the sides, and the blind spot. When you force people to pass on the right, they're now doing something out of the norm, unexpected, and most importantly they're doing it through a larger blind spot.

"}, {"id": "cn3755l", "body": "It is indeed an overtaking lane, not a \"maximum speed allowed\" lane and it's purpose is to promote an organized flow of traffic, in the same way red lights or roundabouts improve traffic flow at intersections.\n\nLet's get back to basics - the idea behind \"keep right unless overtaking\" is that all travel is to be made in the rightmost lane. Any lane(s) to the left should remain empty 90% of the time (unfortunately not the case in heavy traffic) and used solely as a method of getting past the car in front of you, and they should move back to the right lane as soon as they are finished. This is successful as it works no matter the speeds the different cars are travelling at, and is a system where everybody can move at their own speed without getting in anybody's way.\n\nNow - you claim that if you're driving the speed limit then nobody has reason to overtake (legally). I have 3 concerns with this view:\n\n* Even if you claim to be driving at exactly the speed limit and not a km/mile per hour more and therefore nobody has the legal right to overtake you - it is highly likely that your speed will fluctuate slightly up and down and not stay exactly on the speed limit. Same with the guy behind you - and his average speed might be just above yours and is trapped behind you unnecessarily.\n\n* Speedometers are frequently conservative such that your actual speed is just below what it reads on your dashboard. In that case, another car with a slightly differently calibrated speedometer is trapped behind you, even though you're both technically driving the speed limit.\n\n* Finally, it imposes on their free will. You're not the police, and you have no right to restrict the movement of another car based on your belief that they should not be breaking the law and driving at a faster speed. I imagine you would not appreciate it if another car blocked an intersection and refused to move until you put on your seat belt.

Not that there's some conspiracy going on, but more so that they just aren't qualified. Few areas have their limits in place thanks to scientific or engineering consultation, they just pick a speed that more or less is safe, regardless of practicality, and apply it to a roadway. A road with 150 miles of straight, flat driving might be set at 60 simply because the road is prone to fog or has some sharp turns along the way. It's unnecessary and oblivious to think people will not adapt to these road conditions. So, bear that in mind - your mindset that it is \"right\" to stick to the speed limit is not founded on safety or efficiency, but rather a small selection of subjective, arbitrary, and often outdated criteria. Now, let's go with actual safety - what I believe should be the number one concern for our roads. It has been proven time and time again that predictable road conditions are the safest ones. It's also proven on a regular basis that people WILL drive the way they feel is most appropriate for the road, regardless of posted signs. There are outliers on both sides - reckless assholes, and drivers who wouldn't dream of letting the speedometer drift past the limit. So, we establish two things here - people expect the road to be more or less the same on a routine basis, and they WILL disobey arbitrary limits if they aren't reasonable. People expect the left lane to be the fast lane, and open for passing. They EXPECT slow drivers to be in the right lane. Whether or not this is the case is irrelevant - this is what they're assuming will be the case. By driving slower than the natural flow of traffic in the unexpected lane, YOU are a roadway hazard. People will see your car and assume it's driving at the speeds they're used to seeing in that lane. Speed, within reason, is not a problem. Being an outlier, or an anomaly, on the road, is the problem. When you drive slowly in the expected-to-be-fast lane, you are that anomaly. You might be within the legal right, but in terms of true safety, regardless of whether or not the other drivers are legally right, you are the danger."}, {"id": "2q5wpa", "body": "Hi CMV, first time poster.\n\n\n\n\nIf I'm going the speed limit on a highway or freeway, technically no other cars can pass me unless they were to exceed the speed limit.

Yes, for most people, finding out they had sex with someone of a different gender than they expected can be shocking or even mentally unbalancing. Which is fair grounds for some amount of consideration of a \"heat of the moment\" defense, to reduce (but not eliminate) punishment.\n\nHowever, I still want to change your mind. Having a thing called \"trans panic defense\" or \"gay panic defense\" is dangerous for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. It special-cases the situations of rape by fraud when the fraudster happens to be transgender or gay. There is no need to special-case - a general \"heat of the moment\" defense based on **what is shocking to the actual person** is what matters. For example, an honestly highly-religious christian, who dates and marries someone that has misled them to believe they share their faith and depth of feeling for it, finds out their spouse is a complete atheist, posting hateful stuff on message boards against christians etc. The religious person loses it and strikes them. I think this deserves **some** amount of \"heat of the moment\" consideration, even though for most people it would be completely unshocking or even hard to understand (\"SO's an atheist, so? divorce him/her and move on\").\n2. Second, gay and trans people suffer higher than average rates of victimhood, including murder - sometimes the statistics are exaggerated, but even serious estimates show that they do get assaulted and murdered more often. For that reason, having a specific \"trans panic defense\" on the books is bad public policy - we need to **educate** people more on trans people, to reduce the amount of violence trans people suffer. A very powerful step towards that is to not have laws on the books that either legitimize violence against trans people, or seem to.\n\n\"Trans panic\" defenses therefore should be abolished. However, in specific circumstances, the gender - or religion, or age, or political views, or habits, or anything else - **might** be taken into account by the judge during sentencing.\n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2q4liu", "body": "As defined by feminist philosopher, Martha Nussbaum, objectification exists through 7 compents\n\n    instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for the objectifier's purposes;\n    denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking in autonomy and self-determination;\n    inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity;\n    fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable with other objects;\n    violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in boundary-integrity;\n    ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);\n    denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.\n\nThe first problem, I feel, lies with the \"instrumentality\" component, as I feel it fails to make a proper distinction between acts that are or aren\u2019t objectifications due to being too large a concept. All conscious acts we can take part in are inspired through motivational goals; either we do things for the result that is spawned from taking those actions or we do them for the actions themselves, either way they have a purpose.  Knowing that the choice to interact is a conscious action, all our purposeful interactions with others would logically lead to us using them as tools for our goals, whether it would simply to obtain someone\u2019s company or in the job market where we are always either tools for the people to which we provide services or for our superiors or using them as tools to generate income. The logical conclusion, I feel, would be that all acts are objectification which I am sure those who use that term don\u2019t mean. \n\nThe second problem would be in the 4th aspect. I think whether one is replaceable seems to be quite dependent on another's subjective value judgements on one\u2019s capabilities and traits. Furthermore, I doubt anybody is irreplaceable as I am sure for most of our valued traits there are a set of people who share them. For example, you are most likely not the only person who followed a certain curriculum in college that makes you qualified for greater levels of education or a job or has similar experience in the field which makes you technically replaceable. Ultimately, just like the previous component fungibility fails to delineate objectively what is and what isn\u2019t objectification due to subjective nature of value judgements that are required to make judgements on the importance of a position and our inherent lack of uniqueness in abilities. \n\nMy 3rd problem is with the 2nd component. I obviously don\u2019t advocate slavery or rape, but I have a problem with the term \u201clacking\u201d, as a lack ,which doesn\u2019t simply mean not having something, implies an inferior quantity/quality to a certain amount that would be ideal, however, the amount in question  is never specified or described . A distinction, I think needs to be made, as I feel our capacity for self-determination is inherently hindered by societal constructions, for example not wanting to go against cultural norms(which all societies/groups have) to fit in or needing a job of any kind to provide for yourself, and we obviously wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re all objectified. I don\u2019t mind the usage of components 3, 5 and 6, but I feel my response 7th component would resemble the one I had for the 2nd in terms or societal contracts as I feel the fulfillment of one\u2019s feeling goes hand in hand with self-determination.\n\nOther ways to objectify people have been described such as \u201creduction to body/appearance\u201d, however, I feel that from a materialistic standpoint the first (body) is meaningless and that reduction implies that appearance is the only important component in a person\u2019s however another observer could always find other elements that just as important in the \u201cobjectified\u201d person\u2019s actions. For example, you could look at a supermodel and see charisma/attitude that you find similarly important,hence whether one is \"reduced\" to something lies in the observer's perception.\n\n\nEDIT: I apologize in advance if I am too verbose or long-winded\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't know where the original quote comes from. \n\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/\n\n&gt;The word 'instrumentalisation' is often used in debates about free will and/or altruism. Your definition begs the question by presuming that when people act to make others happy they do so for self-regarding reasons. \n\nBegging the question would be for me to include the idea that making people happy is for self-interest in my premises that lead me to the conclusion making people happy is for self-interest. I simply state that if I act to make someone happy this is also related to my self-interest.\n\n&gt;Instances in which people (in particular atheists) sacrifice their lives for others. I think any argument based on their basic, if twisted, selfishness is irrational. \n\nI define self-interest as what is done for your own interests. If you try and make someone happy it is something that you find desirable and hence that is part of your interests. The fact that you died does not change that. The fact that you are acting in your own self-interest does not make you selfish.\n\n&gt;Even if Nussbaum is not using that word in this particular way there is, by your own admission, a way of using the word 'instrumentalisation' that creates a useful distinction. That means that there is a way of using the word 'objectification' that is not overbroad.\n\nYou could always say this about any vague definition, i.e. if only we made that one distinction we wouldn't be using an overbroad definition. However, as it stands, the distinction wasn't made and it is not part of the definition. The fact that some people will choose to make this distinction while using this term does not make the term itself less vague.\n\n&gt;Precision: There is nothing about the word 'objectification' or 'denial of autonomy' that precludes precision. They may not be absolute terms, but they are useful in comparisons.\n\nThe term \u00ab lack \u00bb, as I pointed out, is extremely vague to the point where almost any moment. When you have a term in a scientifically minded discourse that is meant for classification and your definition for that term is so large that anything can be put under it than it is by definition imprecise.\n\n &gt;Empiricism: The problem is not with objectification but with the fact that 'serious debates about gender and social phenomena' must consider people's subjective experiences. Although these experiences are real they are difficult, if not impossible, to measure or verify directly. Instead we rely on what people say. This is an unavoidable problem with every aspect of these debates; it is not unique to this word or concept and if you jettison 'objectification' by this standard you need to dump a number of relevant subjects of controversy. Further, there are empirical aspects to objectification and/or the various criteria.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they must not be considered, it is that you shouldn\u2019t have subjective value judgements within your definition. The problem with your envy to include those type of subjective terms in definitions related to empirical discussions is that subjective terms can apply themselves to anything. There is no objective criterion that is present to prevent me from branding X is ugly or Y is degrading. The problem is the same as with instrumentality in that you are left with a term that has very little classifying power. When I say you are fungible, I am essentially saying you are unimportant which could be said of anything .Even when you take the approach that it is the \u201ctreatment\u201d that is examined your still opening the door to a large amount of ambiguity by merely including replaceable (i.e. unimportant) inside the definition.How do I know if your treated like your unimportant if I don't know what unimportant is, I guess is what I am trying to say.\n \nThe biggest problem is that this component takes implicit assumption that people aren't for the most part interchangeable when ,as you and I agree , is not the case. If we're interchangeable saying we're treated as interchangeable becomes meaningless as this is always the treatment we get by definition (don't know if that makes sense)\n\n&gt;Like I said above 'objectification' is a broad and comparative term. Many things objectify some things more than others.\n\nWhat do you mean by comparative? I think I can use about any word to make comparisons. If you mean in terms of measurement then I\u2019d say objectification is rarely used with a metric or used to compare two things. It is usually used by a percentage of people to classify certain activities or forms of imagery as objectifying. To be more precise, it will be used for example to berate a rap video or a porno for being objectifying and not for being too objectifying.\n\nEdits: minor in few last paragraphs"}, {"id": "2q4liu", "body": "As defined by feminist philosopher, Martha Nussbaum, objectification exists through 7 compents\n\n    instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for the objectifier's purposes;\n    denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking in autonomy and self-determination;\n    inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity;\n    fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable with other objects;\n    violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in boundary-integrity;\n    ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);\n    denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.\n\nThe first problem, I feel, lies with the \"instrumentality\" component, as I feel it fails to make a proper distinction between acts that are or aren\u2019t objectifications due to being too large a concept. All conscious acts we can take part in are inspired through motivational goals; either we do things for the result that is spawned from taking those actions or we do them for the actions themselves, either way they have a purpose.  Knowing that the choice to interact is a conscious action, all our purposeful interactions with others would logically lead to us using them as tools for our goals, whether it would simply to obtain someone\u2019s company or in the job market where we are always either tools for the people to which we provide services or for our superiors or using them as tools to generate income. The logical conclusion, I feel, would be that all acts are objectification which I am sure those who use that term don\u2019t mean. \n\nThe second problem would be in the 4th aspect. I think whether one is replaceable seems to be quite dependent on another's subjective value judgements on one\u2019s capabilities and traits. Furthermore, I doubt anybody is irreplaceable as I am sure for most of our valued traits there are a set of people who share them. For example, you are most likely not the only person who followed a certain curriculum in college that makes you qualified for greater levels of education or a job or has similar experience in the field which makes you technically replaceable. Ultimately, just like the previous component fungibility fails to delineate objectively what is and what isn\u2019t objectification due to subjective nature of value judgements that are required to make judgements on the importance of a position and our inherent lack of uniqueness in abilities. \n\nMy 3rd problem is with the 2nd component. I obviously don\u2019t advocate slavery or rape, but I have a problem with the term \u201clacking\u201d, as a lack ,which doesn\u2019t simply mean not having something, implies an inferior quantity/quality to a certain amount that would be ideal, however, the amount in question  is never specified or described . A distinction, I think needs to be made, as I feel our capacity for self-determination is inherently hindered by societal constructions, for example not wanting to go against cultural norms(which all societies/groups have) to fit in or needing a job of any kind to provide for yourself, and we obviously wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re all objectified. I don\u2019t mind the usage of components 3, 5 and 6, but I feel my response 7th component would resemble the one I had for the 2nd in terms or societal contracts as I feel the fulfillment of one\u2019s feeling goes hand in hand with self-determination.\n\nOther ways to objectify people have been described such as \u201creduction to body/appearance\u201d, however, I feel that from a materialistic standpoint the first (body) is meaningless and that reduction implies that appearance is the only important component in a person\u2019s however another observer could always find other elements that just as important in the \u201cobjectified\u201d person\u2019s actions. For example, you could look at a supermodel and see charisma/attitude that you find similarly important,hence whether one is \"reduced\" to something lies in the observer's perception.\n\n\nEDIT: I apologize in advance if I am too verbose or long-winded\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That means at least 80% of the time the term is being used, it is directed at women specifically. \n\nYou may find that the terms \"idiot\" is generally used to refer men . However, it is not true that the definition of this term is gender exclusive and most of the population which uses those terms isn't going out saying \"there is no such thing as a female idiot\". A term\u2019s definition(i.e. the meaning that was attributed to it through a community's convention) and it's usage aren't always the same thing.\n\n&gt;From a Bayesian perspective, this means that the probability of a person referring to objectifying women given the use of the term objectify is very high. With such a high likelihood, there is little uncertainty or vagueness as to what the word is referring to.\n\nYou established that the term is mostly used to refer to a  gender more than the other, which is , as I said before,is not the same as narrowing down the definition.\n\n&gt;In this case you are being disrespectful because she is a hack without regard to her gender. Actually showing disrespect because she is a woman is what we are talking about, and that is sexist in the least and usually a result of stereotypes and objectification.\n\nFirst,if as you say this the definition that is so common in our culture then I think you should have no trouble linking me to a dictionary or encyclopedia of some sort that defines objectification in such a manner.\n\nSecondly,you were saying that  being disrespectful to women is objectification, now your statement's implications seem to be that it(the disrespect) isn't objectification but actually  a result of objectification the implications being that if they are if one of them is cause and the other the effect that they are different as you wouldn't say that something caused itself or is a \"result\" of itself.\n\n\n&gt;vagueness is determined by whether the listeners understand the meaning that the speaker wanted. \n\nVagueness of the speaker, yes.Vagueness of the term,no.It is determined by low precision in the expression. A term is defined as word accompanied with it's definition.A term's vagueness is hence determined by the  level of precision  present within it's definition. You could say \"the pretty person from Earth\" and some of your friends may get what you are saying and may be able to say \"Stacy Chandler from New York and who has a Ph.d in economics\" yet  none of the terms within the description you made would enable one to logically infer that on paper and they don't narrow it down in anyway that would make Stacy the likely candidate what enables your friend know that is that he knows.\n\n&gt;If the term facilitates communication well, then it is not vague.\n\nTerms always facilitate discussion by nature, as does all language.\n\n&gt;Not if all you are doing is asserting an uncommon and unusual definition for the term and then arguing that because of your new definition, it is vague.\n\n That doesn't follow, even if the definition is uncommon, this definition combined with a word make a term and it is still useful to discuss \"semantics\" to see it's applicability.\n\n"}, {"id": "2q4liu", "body": "As defined by feminist philosopher, Martha Nussbaum, objectification exists through 7 compents\n\n    instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for the objectifier's purposes;\n    denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking in autonomy and self-determination;\n    inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity;\n    fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable with other objects;\n    violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in boundary-integrity;\n    ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);\n    denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.\n\nThe first problem, I feel, lies with the \"instrumentality\" component, as I feel it fails to make a proper distinction between acts that are or aren\u2019t objectifications due to being too large a concept. All conscious acts we can take part in are inspired through motivational goals; either we do things for the result that is spawned from taking those actions or we do them for the actions themselves, either way they have a purpose.  Knowing that the choice to interact is a conscious action, all our purposeful interactions with others would logically lead to us using them as tools for our goals, whether it would simply to obtain someone\u2019s company or in the job market where we are always either tools for the people to which we provide services or for our superiors or using them as tools to generate income. The logical conclusion, I feel, would be that all acts are objectification which I am sure those who use that term don\u2019t mean. \n\nThe second problem would be in the 4th aspect. I think whether one is replaceable seems to be quite dependent on another's subjective value judgements on one\u2019s capabilities and traits. Furthermore, I doubt anybody is irreplaceable as I am sure for most of our valued traits there are a set of people who share them. For example, you are most likely not the only person who followed a certain curriculum in college that makes you qualified for greater levels of education or a job or has similar experience in the field which makes you technically replaceable. Ultimately, just like the previous component fungibility fails to delineate objectively what is and what isn\u2019t objectification due to subjective nature of value judgements that are required to make judgements on the importance of a position and our inherent lack of uniqueness in abilities. \n\nMy 3rd problem is with the 2nd component. I obviously don\u2019t advocate slavery or rape, but I have a problem with the term \u201clacking\u201d, as a lack ,which doesn\u2019t simply mean not having something, implies an inferior quantity/quality to a certain amount that would be ideal, however, the amount in question  is never specified or described . A distinction, I think needs to be made, as I feel our capacity for self-determination is inherently hindered by societal constructions, for example not wanting to go against cultural norms(which all societies/groups have) to fit in or needing a job of any kind to provide for yourself, and we obviously wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re all objectified. I don\u2019t mind the usage of components 3, 5 and 6, but I feel my response 7th component would resemble the one I had for the 2nd in terms or societal contracts as I feel the fulfillment of one\u2019s feeling goes hand in hand with self-determination.\n\nOther ways to objectify people have been described such as \u201creduction to body/appearance\u201d, however, I feel that from a materialistic standpoint the first (body) is meaningless and that reduction implies that appearance is the only important component in a person\u2019s however another observer could always find other elements that just as important in the \u201cobjectified\u201d person\u2019s actions. For example, you could look at a supermodel and see charisma/attitude that you find similarly important,hence whether one is \"reduced\" to something lies in the observer's perception.\n\n\nEDIT: I apologize in advance if I am too verbose or long-winded\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Obviously I am as upset about Saturday's shootings (when two NYPD officers were killed) as everyone so don't think I'm trying to minimize that.\n\nHowever, bigger issues should not allow these officers to get away unpunished. If you don't know what I'm referring to, when New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the hospital where the two officers died, several other officers who were present turned their backs on him in a deliberate show of disrespect. De Blasio is currently facing major criticism from the NYPD unions and even had to have a press conference today where the police commissioner defended him to try and calm things down.\n\nThe officers who publicly and intentionally disrespected the Mayor ought to lose their jobs. If I publicly disrespected my boss, you'd better believe I would get the axe.\n\nPolice officers are charged with a public duty to keep the peace and obey the policies set forth by their superiors. If they don't like it they're free to complain in private just like anyone, but to use their public profiles to make a point is unacceptable. Worse, New York is clearly in need of unity right now and creating further division is a serious safety hazard. These officers aren't just failing in their jobs, they're actively causing damage.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that they thought this was okay to do. They definitely knew what they were doing, so it would be silly to claim they didn't realize it would make the news. They're blaming de Blasio for senseless murders committed by a man who was obviously insane - on the same day, he shot his girlfriend and then committed suicide. The fact that (like most of America) he criticized the NYPD on Twitter is irrelevant, and even if it did matter that has nothing to do with the Mayor.\n\nRegardless of whether its fair or not, the NYPD currently needs to fix its public image in the interest of public safety. Police officers are supposed to be respectable figures who put the public's needs above their own. These officers clearly violated that mission and are trying to stir up trouble, so they should lose their jobs immediately.\n\nCMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
