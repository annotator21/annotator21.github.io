The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy. The boss pays each of her workers \u00a35 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day. At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth \u00a31000 and has paid out \u00a3500. Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for \u00a310 each.

The excess value goes to all of them, who spend it on many things.\n\nOf perhaps some of it is retained as capital by the owners. But what does that really mean? People don't actually \"horde\" money in couches.

But only in a very narrow sense, because in the process of being \"wasted\", it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases, payrolls, etc. Additionally, the businesses that succeed end up generating *more* economic activity. \n\nThis is no different from any other system, BTW. In communism, surplus value is also either created (or, alternately and more likely, a shortage occurs because not enough was produced). The only difference is where the money goes. \n\nIn real-world examples of communist states, the money goes to the state, which \"wastes\" a lot of it in overhead and useless production as well. Or in some kinds of communism, it goes back to the workers.\n\nAnother problem with your view is that factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory, and a lot of incentive to not *create* excess inventory in the first place.

Think about this as a sidenote or whatever.\n\nI think [Robert Lucas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lucas,_Jr.) said that the real problem with economic thought is that it is always late. Late, as in the sense that in the prime days of Lucas (and in these days), the world was becoming more and more complex, making it more and more harder to model (let it be economics, sociology, whatever). Even if we could model it in a certain point of time (and even that's a long shot), by the time we would finish analyzing and creating this model, it would be late and redundant. (I'm not a supporter of the new classical macroeconomics, I was just referring to Lucas).\n\nI know this will sound forced, but remotely speaking, you happened to fall in this trap as well. Strictly theoretically, by the time you have finished this story, the boss could have died or been killed; new bosses could have appeared, new products surfacing...I think you get it.\n\nSince this will be controversial or a field of disagreement, I will take it on a different way as well.\n\nYou made a model, hell I'm using this word way too often, say, you have an economy, and you simply multiplied it: you said \"This example then scales up to the whole world when...\"\nBy that rationale, let's divide it (multiplication and division is interchargeable anyway). There are 3 actors in your economy: 2 workers, and 1 boss or leader or king or whatever. Why are you sure that in this economy (or even the 100 workers and one boss' economy) the price won't fall? I mean, I get it, maybe the boss is greedy, but making some money is better than making literally nothing, isn't it? You only have two potential (!) consumers of your product.\n\nAlso a common saying from Say (oh the pun): \"The more goods (for which there is demand) that are produced, the more those goods (supply) can constitute a demand for other goods\".\n\nAlthough you nowhere stated it explicitly, your submission or view smells like the critique of capitalism.\n\nCapitalism is a by-product of philosophy, early economic thought, and even (when I think about Max Weber, for example) religion. Nobody really wanted it, it (as in the process of moving towards capitalism) just \"happened to happen\". We have tried several alternatives, they were worse. This is the main \"reason\" of its very existence.\n\n"}, {"id": "2qnzap", "body": "As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour, waste has to be produced in order for the system to function.\n\nExample: Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.

The boss pays each of her workers \u00a35 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day.

Yes capitalism is \"inefficient\" in a techincal sense, because of market failures, not because of your argument which I'll talk about in a second. But to attack capitalism on ineficiency grounds is what can be called the \"Nirvana fallacy\", which is, since it's not perfect, it's no good. But that is nonsense, capitalism is, so far the most efficenct system (even if it is not perfect)\n\n2. The SVT in your specific example depends on a bunch of unrealistic assumptions and bad economic theory:\n\nFirst, the assumption that there is just one boss implies that there can't be competition neither in the market for labor nor in the dolls market - meaning the prices are monopolized. You are forcing a situation which is not realistic - Capitalism is about competition, when the market fails to achieve a competitive framework, there is a market failure, but that is the exception not the rule.\n\nSecond, assuming a more general form of the argument, if there is a surplus of \"dolls\" or \"goods\" in the economy, it's expected that the price of these goods will fall - If the offer is bigger than the demand, prices fall. The idea is that, on aggregate, the market without intervention tends to equalize aggregate demand and aggregate supply through relative price changes - in this case the \"wage\" which is a price would be rising in relation to the \"dolls\". \n\nThird, it seems you are assuming a labor value theory. And I mean, it's great to know all economic schools of thought, but if you're going to argue that \"capitalism is a ineficient system\" in a way to describe a huge failure of capitalism in aggregate, you should familizarize yourself with the arguments of the classical economists and other schools more inclined to defend this system - to them value labor theory is on a very basic level very far from reality (subjetive value theory is used instead). \n\nTL,DR: If you're going to attack \"capitalism\" by using aggregate demand vs aggregate supply arguments you need to attack Say's Law directly"}, {"id": "2qnzap", "body": "As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour, waste has to be produced in order for the system to function.\n\nExample: Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.

It is not interfered by government or society. What we have in the US is a Mixed economy. This basically means that the government partially controls the economy in the form of minimum wage, taxes, labor laws, and sometimes even [financial bailouts](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/government-financial-bailout.asp).

In a purely capitalistic society, this system would eventually collapse. (as Marx predicted) The waste would simply outweigh the benefits of capitalism.

I think I would find some of their personalities cute but not exactly my type. There are girls I know but am not friends with nor really think of them romantically because their personalities are off-putting. I suppose it doesn't help to be in the environment I'm in that I'm only exposed to a small facet of personality from the girls I interact with from the all-girls school. If my best friend were a girl, I think I'd rather not date that person primarily for fear of losing that person once we separated. Other friends would make very odd girls... Overall, I'm not sure if I would date them-- it's a good hypothetical question but a difficult one to contemplate. \n\nMore importantly, I wonder if we'd still be friends. The social system in my environment is very segregated between boys and girls. If we were to simply do something together, it'd be considered some sort of date and not a friendly outing, which is probably weird to most people. The fringe friends would probably not be my friends. I imagine it'd be hard to relate with them if they were girls while I think I'd stay in touch with my closer friends. This is a tough thought-experiment, so I'm sorry if I'm repetitive or giving conflicting answers.\n\nIf I were to turn those girls at the all-girls school into guys, I don't think I'd be friends with hardly any of them. Some are very nice and have lovely personalities, but others I can't stand. \n\ntl;dr: I guess if I wouldn't be friends with girls as guys, then I wouldn't think of dating them as girls. But if I were friends with them as guys, the answer is more complicated.\n"}, {"id": "cn7zo2n", "body": "&gt;I guess I try to make new guy friends because I hope they'll have the same interests as I do\n\nWhat are your interests?

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms). There's a strong component to wanting to get better involved in overcoming addiction for most people, but that doesn't mean you can just willpower the physiological side effects of certain addictive substances. Substance withdrawal is an extremely well-documented medical event. You're correct on a pedantic level that someone 'can just stop' taking particular substnaces and that there is some degree of an element of choice, but addiction tends to function because there's a chemical feedback system that essentially punishes you for stopping. This is why your example of locking an alcoholic in a room isn't really true. He's 'cured' insofar as he is no longer exposed to alcohol, but there will be extremely deletrious consequences for that decision if his physiology has adapted.\n\nCombined with physiological symptoms of particular substances (or even behaviors) and I think it's safe to say addiction exists.

I will attempt to characterize them; please correct me if my characterization of your arguments is invalid. I will then attempt to refute specific aspects of these characterizations.\n\n* Chemical dependence (e.g., in the cases of alcholism or heroin addiction) is not to be equated with addiction, because free will still exists and an individual may always choose to abstain. You tie this in with the NHS definition of \"can not control\" their partcipation in the addictive behavior.\n\n* \"Addictions\" without a chemical dependency component are basically crap (overly shortening this, but I think you will follow my meaning), because there is no physical reaction to abstaining from the addictive behavior.\n\n* The inability to prove the existence of something via currently available science means it does not exist.\n\nAgain, please correct me if I've captured any of your views incorrectly.\n\nI would separate physical \"addiction\" (chemical dependence) from \"addictive behavior\" for purposes of analysis, and will use the term \"chemical dependence\" for the former, to clarify.\n\nI think the \"can't prove it exists in the body\" is the weakest of your arguments. We also can't currently prove or disprove any host of other things, ranging from the existence of God, extraterrestrials, until recently the Higgs-Boson particle, etc. Medical science still grapples with many areas: where's our real cure for cancer? The fact that we don't currently understand the mysteries of the body or mind sufficiently to demonstrate a thing is true with currently available techniques is a very weak argument against their existence. We continue to learn and prove new things all the time.\n\nMoving to your more foundational arguments: you have not changed a behavior when you physically deny access to an addictive substance to someone chemically dependent on that substance. You have merely temporarily prevented them from exhibiting that behavior. Witness the number of people who \"quit\" smoking every time they get on an airplane or go into a movie theater. I can guarantee almost every one of them lights up the moment they get back outside the non-smoking environment. It's an overly simplified one, but I think a valid counter-argument.\n\nUsing a somewhat modified example, let's say that you forcibly withheld an addictive substance from someone with chemical dependence on that substance until the chemical dependency had worked itself out via withdrawal, and for this scenario, that the individual did not die in the course of withdrawal (if they did die, it's moot to argue whether or not they are addicted at that time). In such a scenario, when access to the addiction-related behavior becomes available again, does the individual partake, or abstain, and what is the resultant status of their addiction?\n\nI think this is the really interesting part of the question. Here we hone in on the \"can not control\" part of the NHS definition. I would present that phrase in a slightly light: it's not that free will does not exist, but that the lure of the addictive behavior is so great, that the individual typically cannot manage to abstain. Now, this comes close being in sync with your argument: \"the indivdual just lacks the willpower\", but I think that is a hair overly simplistic.\n\nOur brains are a (massively interconnected) network of neurons and synapses, with varying strength synaptic connections betweeen various neurons and portions of the brain. The ability of addictive substances to alter the synaptic connections and brain patterns of humans (as well as other animals) is well proven. Just as negative reinforcement can alter behavior (how many times do you have to touch the electric fence or hot stove?), positive reinforcement can create massive incentive in the brain to take an action that will result in a known positive (perceived) reward.\n\nNow, this does not mean that the brain did not independently arrive at a choice: it may mean that that choice is very heavily modified by prior experience and involvement with the addictive behavior. Perhaps so much that many individuals can simply arrive at no other behavioral outcome.\n\nIn regards to the \"addiction\" of those whose \"addiction\" is of the non-chemical dependent variety (gambling, shopping, etc), I think you're ignoring the fact that there *is* still a chemical change. The high of a big payout in gambling may result not only in financial gain, but also a huge endorphin and adrenalin rush. A new dress (or bowl of ice cream) may temporarily help offset feelings of depression (potentially from an untreated chemical imbalance, or other reasons).\n\nGoing back to my earlier statement though: a lot of this stuff is still a mystery to a certain extent within modern medicine. Given the objective understanding that many addictive behaviors have massively negative outcomes over the long term, it seems clear that given full \"freedom of choice\" to abstain from such behaviors, anyone and everyone would. The fact that many do not seems to imply that there is more to the picture."}, {"id": "cn7u8px", "body": "&gt; Well, what we call the effects of addiction can certainly be observed like chemical dependence and withdrawal.\n\nWhat are the withdrawal effects of a shoppaholic or workaholic?

But people draw their self confidence from different sources: but never from within themselves. I'm going to elaborate more on this, but let's take a detour to discuss what you call \"absence of willpower.\" Willpower is directly related to self esteem: how can a person with no confidence in himself do anything? Therefore, a person must first have self esteem before he can have willpower.

But we will continue.\n\nNow, let's discuss the sources from which a person derives his self esteem. There are many different sources, and more than 1 can apply, but most of them fall into a few categories (remember, it cannot be derived from within). Most people draw their self esteem from other people, or from their work. For example, an attractive person can principally self esteem because everyone likes him. Similarly, a student with no friends can derive self esteem from his high grades. People also derive self esteem from their relationship with their family.\n\nNow, let's discuss the addict. There are several types of addiction, and because self esteem can be derived in different ways, there are different types of addiction. Let's first discuss the alcohol addict. Firstly, alcohol is a chemical that physically affects the brain, and creates dependence, as you know. I won't go into that, you can google how alcohol works in a physical sense. But lets discuss the cause of alcoholism. The alcoholic drinks for 2 main reasons: to gain pleasure, or to impair cognitive function. He can gain pleasure by satisfying his mental urge for alcohol, and he impairs cognitive function so that he will not think about certain things, perhaps an ex girlfriend or the ever-present fear of death. These two reasons will blend over time, and the alcoholic will usually drink to serve both purposes. \n\nThe fact that alcohol can be used by a person to gain pleasure is problematic. The reason? All humans seek pleasure naturally, as in, it is part and parcel of the human condition. In addition, the alcoholic usually has little to no self esteem: therefore no willpower. As you can see, this is a mental cycle. There is no willpower to stop the drinking, and the drinking also causes pleasure. *This* is addiction.\n\nNow, to prove that addiction is an illness, I will demonstrate how it is treated from a mental perspective. As soon as an alcoholic checks into rehab or visits an AA group, things change. In an AA group, the alcoholic gains friends, friends who he shares similar experiences with. He can derive self esteem from these friends: if he stops drinking, he will please them, and therefore feel better about himself. Similarly, in rehab, a person will slowly be administered less and less alcohol over time: medication that is pleasurable or relieves the urge to drink is also applied, to mediate the discomfort. I don't know much about rehab.\n\nI hope I've changed your view. Psychology is very interesting: I recommend you find the answer to your question in more detail by reading \"The Denial of Death\" by Ernest Becker. While not directly related to addiction, it neatly defines the foundations of modern psychology that will allow you to reason to the conclusion I have already demonstrated."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2qncj3", "body": "I've always had a respect for the men in uniform and I've always wanted to join.

You have very little control over the course of your career; even if you are exceptional at your job you are just another face in the crowd.  If you do get recognized then they will begin grooming you for their needs, not necessarily yours.  If you don't get recognized job selection is managed by a faceless bureaucracy that doesn't care what your skill set is, it only cares that you meet all the criteria.\n\n2.  I'm not sure how the Army is, but I'm sure it's not too different than the USAF.  The annual performance report has been a thorn in the side of ever USAF leader for decades and is written by your superior officer.  If he doesn't think you're ready for promotion he can literally change 3 or 4 words in your performance report and that will send a signal to the board saying \"This guy's not ready yet\" even though there is a scale of 1-5 on there and you're rated as a 5 they understand not to promote you.\n\n3.  It's all about following *exceptionally* dumb rules.  During my first exercise (where you pretend you're about to deploy) we had to pack readiness bags with a list of everything you needed.  In this list included 1 comb and 1 bottle of shampoo.  I haven't used a comb since probably the 5th grade and at the time my hair was cut 1/8 inch all around so I didn't need either one.  The store on base was sold out because of the exercise so I said \"fuck it\".  Of course my bag gets randomly selected and I get a fail which my officer in charge had to explain to his boss.  They don't care that my hair was cut 1/8 inch and I needed neither they just wanted an answer as to why my bag got a fail and it made their numbers look bad.  \nAnother more recent example:  I work in aircraft maintenance, aircraft that aren't scheduled to fly are scheduled down for maintenance and training.

Most of the people here are trying to convince you not to be a military doctor, but don't seem to have a problem with the military itself. I think I am unlikely to change your view, but I personally find the military to be detestable, and I want to encourage you not to glorify it or want to be part of it. The most obvious thing is that the military is nothing more than an organized machine of mass murder. every part, from combat soldiers, to janitors, to medics, are there to support their killing mission.  They are simply serial killers on a massive scale. and there is no more disgusting thing possible.\n\nYou say that you support the \"warriors\" but don't agree with the policy. Unfortunately, i don't think this is logically consistent (particularly in a volunteer military). In fact, id actually argue that it makes more sense to be think the other way around. The \"warriors\" are actually more evil than the policy, because they have decided that they are willing to be unthinking killers, while at least the policy makers presumably have some justification for their desire to tell the unthinking killers to go out and murder people they have never met and have no personal grudge against. \n\n\"Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction....

(1967)\n\nId further state that you seem to really like the camaraderie that is associated with the military. This is problematic for several reasons, including: (1) while camaraderie can be a good thing, it can also be a bad thing when it is in service of evil. Militaries are evil, whether they are ISIS or the US military. (2) it almost seems like you are trying to fill a personal need for companionship through a system such as the military. if that is the case, there are many other options you can use. even, med school will give you that chance, and not force you to join a killing machine. (3) there are obviously other reasons here, but the basic point is that the military is an indirect solution to the problem that you seem to have, loneliness and feelings of isolation. and it is not a good idea to hope it will solve your problems.\n\nId also add that the US military particularly is a disgusting institution, filled with high school dropouts, rapists, idiots, and the lowest people in society. It has become the choice of last resort for people who can't do anything useful with their lives. i could go on, but my point is that it is a philosophically disgusting institution (organized serial killers), but it is also a disgusting one in real life.\n\nAnd last, what i consider probably the most important problem with you wanting to be in the military, that being a physician is fundamentally at odds with being in the military. Physicians are generally help to the standard of the (some form of the) Hippocratic Oath, such that they pledge to \"do no harm\" and \"solemnly pledge to consecrate my life to the service of humanity;... will practice my profession with conscience and dignity;...The health of my patient will be my first consideration;...\" and so forth.  But the military, any military, asks completely different pledges of its members. And their first duty is to the military itself and its goals. These goals often (if not always) include killing civilians and putting politics over humanity and dignity.  And in my opinion, a doctor can not in good conscious be part of a military of any kind. (obviously, that does not mean that can not be helping people in times of war. in fact, doctors are the only human part of war, and are basically the opposite of war in times of war).\n\nANyway, i know it is not a popular opinion to hate the military, but as i said above, i find all militaries to be evil.  and the US military is particularly so. unlike you,  i hate the soldiers more than i hate the institution. And i sincerely hope I've given you things to think about, and maybe even helped change your view about wanting to be part of the military (I know that you have changed your view about being a military doctor, but I'm mostly focusing on the military part. you seemed to have changed your view based on practical reasons... long service and low chance of being a neurosurgeon in the military).

The chain reaction of evil \u2014 hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars \u2014 must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.\" Martin Luther King Jr., Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? (1967)\n\nId further state that you seem to really like the camaraderie that is associated with the military. This is problematic for several reasons, including: (1) while camaraderie can be a good thing, it can also be a bad thing when it is in service of evil. Militaries are evil, whether they are ISIS or the US military. (2) it almost seems like you are trying to fill a personal need for companionship through a system such as the military. if that is the case, there are many other options you can use. even, med school will give you that chance, and not force you to join a killing machine. (3) there are obviously other reasons here, but the basic point is that the military is an indirect solution to the problem that you seem to have, loneliness and feelings of isolation. and it is not a good idea to hope it will solve your problems.\n\nId also add that the US military particularly is a disgusting institution, filled with high school dropouts, rapists, idiots, and the lowest people in society. It has become the choice of last resort for people who can't do anything useful with their lives. i could go on, but my point is that it is a philosophically disgusting institution (organized serial killers), but it is also a disgusting one in real life.\n\nAnd last, what i consider probably the most important problem with you wanting to be in the military, that being a physician is fundamentally at odds with being in the military. Physicians are generally help to the standard of the (some form of the) Hippocratic Oath, such that they pledge to \"do no harm\" and \"solemnly pledge to consecrate my life to the service of humanity;... will practice my profession with conscience and dignity;...The health of my patient will be my first consideration;...\" and so forth.  But the military, any military, asks completely different pledges of its members. And their first duty is to the military itself and its goals. These goals often (if not always) include killing civilians and putting politics over humanity and dignity.  And in my opinion, a doctor can not in good conscious be part of a military of any kind. (obviously, that does not mean that can not be helping people in times of war. in fact, doctors are the only human part of war, and are basically the opposite of war in times of war).\n\nANyway, i know it is not a popular opinion to hate the military, but as i said above, i find all militaries to be evil.  and the US military is particularly so. unlike you,  i hate the soldiers more than i hate the institution. And i sincerely hope I've given you things to think about, and maybe even helped change your view about wanting to be part of the military (I know that you have changed your view about being a military doctor, but I'm mostly focusing on the military part. you seemed to have changed your view based on practical reasons... long service and low chance of being a neurosurgeon in the military).

Should we outlaw GPS receivers because some criminals use GPS coordinates to locate drop boxes of illicit goods? Should we outlaw virtual private network connections for business because some criminals use VPN technology for secure communication? Should we outlaw writing and language because criminals make use of those advances?\n\nShould we outlaw anonymous speech because some people abuse anonymity? This cuts both ways.

If you want to take away anonymous communication, then you have to extend that to positive uses of anonymous communication as well. Back in 1955 the Supreme Court in the USA noted that \"Protections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse. Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical minority views . . . Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hands of an intolerant society.\"\n\nYou state that you aren't aware of TOR being used to overthrow a tyrannical government. That may be true. But I am aware of anonymous speech being used to grand political purpose. The Federalist Papers where written under pseudonyms and it was not until Hamilton's death that the public learned who the authors were. \n\nUltimately the debate is really about the balance between individual liberty and social safety. And there is a balancing act. But the measure has traditionally been that outlawing a technology is a drastic step that requires clear objective evidence that the potential social harm caused by the technology overrides any social benefit. The social benefits of anonymous communication are well understood. So are the social harms. The historical response has always been to tell the police to work harder at policing, and to tweak the laws to allow them to do that effectively.

They went so far as to require all new contacts in my email address to be approved by them, and could read any email I sent. \n\nTo them, the internet was just for porn, with a couple of good services like Email and encyclopedias. And they did everything in their power to make sure that I stayed on the \"Good\" sites. \n\nWell, I hated the way they controlled my email, so I made a gmail account, and just hid it from them. It felt so freeing. I could email whoever I wanted, and even instant message. Being a lock-key child, this was new territory for me. I could contact whoever I wanted, pretty much whenever I wanted.

I now had direct, uncensored internet whenever I wanted, in the privacy of my room, and they never found out about it (until years after i moved out). Guess what I did? I learned to program. I installed probably 20 different types of linux on these shitty old machines I had been given. I learned how to search for things online and find any information I wanted.

That can settle any court fees for having to defend yourself.\n\nAnd I am certainly not arguing that there is a near irrevocable harm that comes from being accused, regardless of outcome, in the form of perceptual biases from friends/family/community.\n\nNevertheless, you used the word *worse* to describe the difference in the crimes. That's a pretty bold statement. Rape involves actual physical and mental trauma. Trauma that is difficult to recover from, some may never recover from. Just because they have *legal* recourse doesn't mean they won't be mentally scarred indefinitely. Whoopdie do, their rapist is now behind bars. It's not like the victim has recourse to regain that mental or physical trauma as if it never happened. Not everyone recovers because \"justice was served.\" \n\nNow, without arguing that a false accusation is harmful to the accused, this is more in the form of perceptual harm. People who first hear the account may be somewhat immune to a change in perception if given later facts that they were, infact, innocent. But that doesn't change the fact they were never *physically and mentally assaulted* in a much more heinous manner than an accusation. \n\nIf your boss fires you over you being falsely accused, if it's overturned, you then counter sue him if he doesn't give you your job back. Recourse. If your family doesn't forgive you for a false accusation, if it's overturned, well then you have another set of problems within your family. \n\nAt least officially and legally, if it's overturned, you're not labeled as a criminal, a rapist. Perceptions aside, that's the recourse.\n\nIf you're raped, there's no unraping that can be done. It's similar to the logic of the death penality. If you kill someone who was later determined to be falsely guilty, there is no recourse on giving them their life back. At least if you're determined innocent before death, or if death penalty were illegal, you'd suffer serious harm from incarceration and the stigma attached, *but you still have your life*. Therefore, the latter will NEVER be worse than the former.\n\nThe rest just has to do with the fact there is no perfectly objective way to deal with justice in a society. You have to apply *some* system, otherwise chaos and anarchy. As long as we make systematic improvements, we're heading in a positive direction. But you need to put forth your own solution, one that likely accounts for all of the real world problems and limitations, not one that just \"sounds good\" in your head."}, {"id": "2qn42n", "body": "Im sure everyone has seen a version of this debate both on this sub and in real life, but today I'd like to focus on a specific part of the debate.

If falsely accused of rape, you can counter-sue for slander. People have done this. Rape is not special in this way - if you are accused of anything publicly, you can sue for slander.\n\nNow, there is something special about an accusation of rape: It generally has no unambiguous evidence for it. Evidence of sex does not show consent or not. On the other hand, evidence of murder or a robbery is unambiguous - a person is dead, or something has been physically stolen.\n\nSo you could in theory make an argument that a rape accusation is the hardest type of accusation to refute.

They may fight the allegation in court and win.\n\nwhile\n\n* Being raped can cause serious mental and physical trauma that some people do not manage to recover from.

With absolutely anything, there will always be things that people that aren't a fan of. Make major changes and instead of Person A hating the series and Person B loving it, now Person A loves it and Person B hates it. You're entirely in your right to feel that CoD is overrated, and personally it seems futile to change this view. You like what you like. I can only provide objective points to maybe calibrate your perspective.\n\nSo back to numbers don't lie. Consider the goal the creators of CoD have. To make money. And they consistently perform this goal well year after year. Now, you're an executive of Activision-Blizzard. Why would you tell the developers to do a complete 180 on the series, \"for change's sake.\"? You only run risk and very little reward. If you stick to the tried and true model they've had, you're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. I'm sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula. \n\nReally, your view of \"overrated and overhyped\" is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own *personal* threshold for formulaic video games. But this view is separate from the objective success of the series. If they keep selling games, it means people still enjoy the series for what it is. The idiom, \"Don't fix what isn't broken\" comes to mind. There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche, hackneyed, etc. I mean, be realistic here, if they promised the most radically new CoD next year, would you buy it? Probably not. You have a bias against the series. Why would their target audience be the people who *don't* like CoD? It makes no sense.\n\nThe other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive. Making an entirely new engine is costly, takes years to develop, and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release. It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code, which drastically reduces the time (and therefore cost) it takes to make a new game. Brand new engine CoDs likely wouldn't make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it. They aren't a charity, so gamers aren't entitled to it.

I'm talking about overall gameplay experience, the subjective fun factor. In my view, gaming with a gamepad is more FUN (up to a certain level of required accuracy which is rarely reached.)\n\nI played through all of BioShock Infinite and Portal 2 with a 360 pad and there were only a couple of sections where I grabbed the mouse instead.

It's actually very rare that you're put into a wide open area with many hostiles who need to be quickly and accurately dispatched to stay alive.
