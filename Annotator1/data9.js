One thing all diagnosis have in common is that behaviors they address are disruptive beyond just the individual experiencing them. In other words, there is a cultural element as to whether or not particular behaviors are considered evidence of a diagnosis. Generally speaking, if a behavior is not disruptive in terms of their ability to function in society or they are not (on the whole) disruptive to that society itself (in a direct manner), then that behavior would not be considered diagnosable. \n\nAlso, you'll likely find that all the appropriate diagnosis criteria already exists in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) for people who do have a mental disorder that is being expressed in the context of religion.

You cite computers, yet they are a form of automation as well.\n\nRight, but look at the difference.  Prior to computers you would employ a file clerk, a secretary, and an accountant to do what the computer does.  One excel spreadsheet does the work of an accountant in significantly less time, for a fixed cost of one week's pay for the accountant.  With phone answering systems, dictation software, wordprocessing software, etc, that's another job replaced at the cost of a month or two of pay.  File Clerk?  Windows has a search function, and you don't have to pay nearly as much to electronically store the files (even if you're paying for a data back up facility).\n\nWhat used to be about 20 jobs for a smallish company working in a white collar field have now been displaced, and replaced with... what?  3 jobs in IT?  15% job replacement rate isn't sustainable.\n\n&gt; Will the solution of the past (just do something else) keep working or not?\n\nNo, not really.  The jobs in the production of making our lives better have been replaced steadily since the industrial revolution (for the relevant country).  The automation revolution (which history will say we're in the dawn of) will push everything to the service economy, a transition that was observed as having started under Reagan.  \n\nThe problem is that a service economy is completely unsustainable without input from outside sources.  A Barista quite simply cannot afford to get coffee from another barrista often enough to keep all barristas employed, especially when a computerized espresso machine gets to the point where it can replace a starbucks employee. \n\nTo see examples of this, take a look at any tourist town.  Alternately, take a look at any town where the major industries have fallen on hard times.  The Rust Belt, for example, or Detroit.\n\nSee, the problem with Automation is that it's going to, eventually, hit *every* major industry.  It won't be a question of exporting Steel jobs or Manufacturing jobs... it's going to be a question of replacing basically *all* jobs.  If machines can replace us in making most of what we do... as jobs become more tenuous, people will be more careful about what they do with their money, meaning that the machine made cup of coffee that costs 50% but is 90% as good as the human made one will become the preferred choice, thus putting even barristas out of jobs..."}, {"id": "cnfev7n", "body": "It may be different, but that's not the reason.\n\nAutomation still needs setting-up and maintenance, you're not taking the human completely out of the equation.

Computers arnt any smarter than they were 40 years ago. Hell you computers dont even have a measure of smartness.\n\nYou're actually fundamentally wrong on this point. \n\nThere are basically 3 major ways of identifying intelligence in psychology: the 3-stratum model; multiple intelligences model; and the triarchic theory of intelligence. The stratum model is the one that most clearly aligns to the biological functioning of our brain and is largely gaining the most traction. The other two are useful as abstractions but do not seem to match up to how our brain actually works. \n\nThe 3-stratum model says that intelligence is really an emergent property that we see by looking at narrow specific abilities, which in turn layered up to broad abilities, and that all that together the whole of these broad abilities is our IQ. \n\nIn the AI field, specific narrow abilities have definitively increased. As just one example, chess computers can now regularly beat the world champion whereas 40 years ago they couldn't beat a decent club player. Since the stratum model says intelligence is an umbrella that covers these layers, and the lowest layer has increased, under this model computers are unarguably more intelligent than they were 40 years ago. \n\nThe other two models follow similar analysis, so I won't go into them here. But basically, as far as cognitive psychology goes -- computers are doing better in measures of intelligence. \n\nNow you might say that passing electrons around in a brute force algorithm isn't the same as really playing chess so that isn't intelligence. But the reality is that it is the same. That is the point of the Turing test. While the underpinning computations are vastly different, the functional result is indistinguishable from an external perspective. \n\nWe don't pretend that computers are intelligent because they have a really big biological brain. We understand they are silicone and copper and plastic and metal and function at a low level much differently than humans do. But the resulting output is indistinguishable from highly intelligent human action. And that is how we measure intelligence. \n\nCars aren't slower than humans because they don't have legs to run on. They are still faster than humans around a track. Likewise, computers are smarter, much smarter, than they were 40 years ago, and they are on pace to put us to shame in numerous areas very, very soon (and in many areas they are doing so already). \n\nThe computer program Eugene nearly passed a formal Turing test this year for human language interaction. He convinced 10 of 30 expert judges that he was a human being. It won't be too long before that number climbs to 30 of 30. Computers aren't more intelligent than us generally, yet. But as each of their narrow specialties becomes better and better, and as networking computers together becomes easier and faster, it will not be long before a computer, or network of computers, is superior to us at every human task. \n\nI'm not saying next week. But if the advances of the last few years continue to show as much promise as they have, the next few decades will be game changing. \n\n"}, {"id": "cnfjpav", "body": "&gt;I see no reason why it can't. \n\nThen you are ignorant.\n\n&gt;Technology improves at an exponential rate\n\nNo it doesnt\n\n&gt;Computers get smarter and smarter and one day computers will make better computers\n\nNo they wont. and no they arnt.

The localized labor is the part that keeps towns/cities functional.  When the big labor users automate it has big impacts.  \n\nChili's and others are testing automated tablets for you to handle everything yourself, so you can get rid of waiters and just downgrade to bussers, which will be paid less and get less tips because they aren't providing as much service.\n\nStores had mixed success with self checkout, but they will continue to improve them until they are the norm.

Automation is happening faster, and we also added in a global work force.  3D printing, cheaper robotics and more complex automation will have a major impact in the next 20 years because the government will have to solve the growing underemployment problem one way or another, and the moment large corporations don't have the ability to take advantage of their employees they will quickly reduce their need for them further.\n"}, {"id": "cnf4f6m", "body": "They've been saying this since the 30s.

So, I don't think the fact that it didn't happen 80 years ago is any indication about the likelihood of it happening now.\n\nOn the other hand, not all industries are really susceptible to automation. For example, the medical industry requires bedside manner which is the obvious thing preventing automation. Medical workers rely on their ability to get important information from patients who are vague, deceitful, or simply don't know enough to concisely communicate their problems. On top of that, emergency medical workers work in some of the most unpredictable environments that exist. The physical dexterity in tight spaces coupled with navigating an unpredictable terrain is enough to make robot ambulances a monumentally difficult thing to achieve. It's possible it would happen eventually but it will require not only better artificial intelligence than we are capable of making currently as well as a complete overhaul of the way we build houses to allow a robot to even access most patients in the first place.\n\nCompare this to something like fast food or manufacturing. Flipping burgers or even cooking complex dishes can DEFINITELY be reduced to a repetitive process that a machine could accomplish.\n\nI think people will experience more of a shift of desired expertise rather than a complete elimination of people from jobs in the near future.

Most people will not care about the unfortunate ones, because they don't care for unfortunate right now, they probably won't do that in future.

If they can do everything, why wouldn't they code themselves so that they become the most efficient. I mean that's why they are made for anyway to be efficient and economic. Humans taking away resources while doing nothing is not economic. We would take up place where the could build e.g. nuclear plants for their energy.\n\nI for example don't want to have 100% leisure time.

Principally, these will be jobs that require cognitive functions machine cannot perform. I'd include in this anything related to science (making new discoveries), engineering (someone has to implement automation and maintain the machines) and creative (art, writing, music, etc).

I used to wonder why I couldn't program device drivers and  instead did web apps. The answer is that I could barely do trigonometry. I remember all of the higher level programmers and all of them could do calculus and breezed through trig. In fact, people that can do HTML, the most basic \"programming\" for the web (although it's really just a markup language with no programmability), then you usually have to at least do advanced algebra. \n\nHere's how it generally panned out: Basic Math/Pre-Algebra (can't program), Algebra/Geometry  (HTML, tech support, general IT),  Trigonometry/Pre-calculus/Business Calc (programming and sql but not high level stuff like interacting with hardware/device driver/etc.), Calculus/Statistics/Differential/Equations (these are the \"rock star\" programmers working for MS and Google).\n\nIt's not a perfect system but it's generally correct. I'm lucky I could do more than algebra or I'd be like almost every other acquaintance I knew in the late 90's that tried to get into programming and sadly just couldn't do it even though they were highly intelligent. Programming, like musical ability, has a genetic component and can't just be learned by anyone through great effort. Sometimes it just doesn't compute.

It probably will cause massive unemployment if we don't do anything about it. However, advancements in technology have made people jobless since the beginning of technology, long before the invention of a wheel. And technology is advancing way slower than more people are trying to make it seem.\n\nFor example, let's have a look at autonomous cars.\n\nPeople have been trying to bulit a self-driving car basically since they built the first car. Of course they didn't have the technology. There was almost no progress until a few decades ago, when personal computers started to become a thing. Some serious advancements were made in the 1980s but that was barely enough to develop some basic Driver Assistance Systems (like ABS).\n\nThen Google enters the scene. Well, if they decided to do this, the problem of automated driving should be solved within a couple of years, shouldn't it? Well, no. After about a decade of development, there is still not much more than prototypes that are only tested under strict human supervision. They are still far away from hitting the market and the year 2020 that is being quoted lately is more of a marketing stunt than a real prognosis. And that's not a surprise, really, making a car drive itself is a really difficult task. \n\nBut let's assume for a moment, that those cars do, in fact, hit the market in 2020. Google's technology is based on a radar rotating at a very fast rate, connected to a computer with lots of precalculated information. All that stuff will at least double the cost of producing such a vehicle. That means it's going to be **expensive**. For a while it's going to be nothing more than a gadget for rich early adopters. If we wanted to use cheaper sensors, like stationary radars and cameras, we'd be putting ourselves back by a decade or two.\n\nAnother important fact - the first model of a self-driving car will probably look like a Smart and have a speed cap around 40 mph. If they were introduced to the market by 2020, then maybe we'd have a few autonomous taxis by 2030. That's more of a quirk than a real threat to anyone's job, though.\n\nAnd up until this point we've only discussed driverless **cars**. As far as replacing humans goes, this may only make the taxi drivers unemployed. There are all kinds of other vehicles that are driven by humans as their jobs, like trucks and buses. Let's have a look at those. \n\nRemember when I said that making a car drive itself is really difficult? Well, compared to making a bus or a truck drive itself, that problem is a joke. Operating a big vehicle like this is orders of magnitude more difficult than operating a car. Solving this problem is not even being seriously discussed yet. If you are a taxi driver at the moment and you're bad at it, you may have a tiny chance of being replaced by a machine sometime around your retirement age. If you're a bus driver, though, not a chance.\n\nLet's think about jobs that are easier for the computer than driving a car and yet machines have not yet replaced humans doing them:\n\n* operating a train - seriously, this job seems like it was made for a computer to do. Modern trains do most of the stuff for the human operator, yet there are still human operators there. Always.\n\n* air traffic control - the second most stressful job on the face of this planet, heavily aided by computers, and yet it's still dependent on humans.\n\n* flying a plane - there is almost no computer vision problems (which are the worst part of making an autonomous car) involved in this, most of the stuff is done by computers anyway, pilots should be going out of jobs right now, especially if we had computers do the air traffic control.\n\nAnd my favourite:\n\n* checkout at a supermarket. Seriously, this should have been done years ago. Best we have right now is self-checkout, which is nothing more than putting a customer in the place of an employed cashier. It still requires assistance from human employer and is not really popular either. It's irritating as hell, and I, being an absolute technology lover, try to avoid using self-checkout as much as I can. It made me angry just thinking about it.\n\nConclusion: people will lose jobs because of advancements in technology. They've always have. You personally may become jobless within your lifetime, but if you're a skilled worker that's rather unlikely. One thing is for sure - the chaos you've described, if it will happen at all, it will not be within our lifetimes.\n\nUnless a ship full of friendly aliens lands on our planet and they make our technology advance 10 times as fast as it normally would. Then most of us would be jobless within a few months. However, it probably would be cheaper for the aliens to use humans as their workforce, so maybe it wouldn't be so bad after all."}, {"id": "2rekvc", "body": "I'm genuinely scared of the future; that with the pace of automation and machines that soon human beings will be pointless in the future office/factory/whatever.\n\nI truly believe that with the automated car, roughly 3 million jobs, the fact that we produce so much more in our factories now, than we did in the 90's with far fewer people, and the fact that computers are already slowly working their way into education, medicine, and any other job that can be repeated more than once, that job growth, isn't rosy.\n\nI believe that the world will be forced to make a decision to become communistic, similar to Star Trek, or a bloody free-for-all similar to Elysium.

Let's look at one of the largest periods of automation in history, the Agricultural revolution. Before the agricultural revolution more than 50% of the workforce worked on food. It was an incredibly labor intensive job that paid absolute shit, just like many of the jobs that are soon going to be automated in the modern world!\n\nA massive portion of the workforce lost their jobs due to inventions like crop rotation, mills, Iron plow or any other new farming technique. But this did not lead to chaos, but a massive increase in the well being of the whole population.\n\nFor a few years there were many that had it bad, but eventually with the sudden decrease in food prices people started to demand new things with their increased wealth. This lead to new industries being created and other industries expanding.\n\nThis has happened in every series of automation in human history. A short period of poverty for those who lose their jobs, and then a massive increase of wealth for everyone as new industries expand and pick up the newly available labor force and market towards all the people with increased spending money. \n\nThere is no reason to suspect that the current automation cycle will be any different than the agricultural, industrial or computer cycles of automation.
