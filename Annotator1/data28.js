Look at it this way--if I was going to cause destruction related to what I believed to be an incredibly unjustified police shooting, then I would seek to impact the police somehow (shut down their website, release public commentary, block the station's entrances/cars with one's body, etc).\n\nYou **might** be able the make the case that hurting those against you could be for the greater good (might, depending on how much danger they put you in to determine relative hurt).

Thank you!\n\n_____\nIt is my contention that the property destruction and disruption of commerce in Ferguson are the only reasons that this issue gained international attention.  We have a democracy that acts almost exclusively in the interests of a small handful of corporate elites and government officials, which causes actual human suffering to be on the back burner.  Other avenues for political redress such as voting and even peaceful protesting by itself (which are ultimately more effective in the end, but typically only after having a flash point or event to rally around) have been largely compromised by corporate interests and strategic incapacitation policing techniques.  There are racially tinged police murders under far less ambiguous circumstances wherein the behavior of the officers is much more difficult to justify that never gained as much traction when protesters hold exclusively peaceful demonstrations, and it underlies our society's perpetual valuing of windows and business over actual human lives.  Moreover, high profile riots make white middle America (which controls the political arena) evaluate the issue.  When White America is afraid that traffic will be blocked, or that their business might be burned/looted, or that a brick might come flying through their living room window, this forces the issue into the public consciousness and varying solutions must be considered.  \n\nMany say that the property destruction opened the issue to easy critiques since many are beholden to heavily indoctrinated notions of bourgeois morality (the old two wrongs don't make a right adage, even when one wrong is a death and the other is property being destroyed/stolen), and while this is true it gave people a cause to rally around.  White America and the media are masterful at rationalizing and ignoring systemic racism and police brutality, and while the #blacklivesmatter is obvious propaganda it has kept the discussion of racist policing in the public discourse since it did grow organically after a high profile police shooting.  The rioters took action which has a strong psychological impact on those for whom the issue resonates.  Taking action (even a less than ideal one) has much weight than people claiming to \"support\" a cause without actually giving anything of themselves to it.\n\nThe tactic of rallying around a murder to highlight racist inequity has been employed since the Classic Civil Rights Era (see the murder of Emmett Till), and people arguing over whether or not the particular murder in question was less than ideal miss the point entirely.  People are talking about the murder, and (even if for a brief second) the issues that sparked the outrage though this more important narrative is tightly controlled by a media apparatus hellbent on fixating on the explosion than the planting and lighting of the bomb that caused it.  Had it been a perfect situation with the cops saying \"nigger\" before shooting a completely sympathetic victim and even if it was video recorded by a very credible witness, the discussion would have easily devolved into \"this particular cop was just a bad egg,\" and the protests got what they wanted when he was fired/convicted.  \n\nBecause of the ambiguity in the Ferguson shooting, the stark contrasts in *perceptions* among blacks and whites becomes a primary issue of contention.  It's not about bad cops getting out of hand on occasion, but about why so many black people have the idea that the cops treat them unfairly or with undue violence.   No one would have even been talking about that had the case been less focused on contradictory narratives, and it would have never even made international news if the police hadn't responded in a militarized fashion to the peaceful protests that were mobilized after the initial riots.  This uproar was never about police militarization or even bad egg cops.  It is about public policies that have created racist law enforcement practices that marginalize and inflame the black community. Not many have said it that articulately, but it's bubbling underneath the surface of the \"national discussion\" on Ferguson.  In an ideal democracy, third party property destruction would perhaps not be a valid form of political voicing, but as blacks are particularly disenfranchised politically and economically in the US, so using militant tactics to express rage at the societal failings I mentioned above are not only inevitably, but necessary.  \n\nEDIT:  I've already responded to a couple of people strawmanning about how the media was mobilized before the rioting after the verdict.  This post is about the first wave of riots that made the issue a sensation in the first place.  \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Either agree with OP or make a persuasive argument to change his mind. I upvoted his cogent argument and agree with him that the facts that a long history of racist public policy (both formally enumerated in law and informally in culture) has lead to a justified outrage within communities of color juxtaposed to the moderate whites blissful ignorance of the harsh multi-generational injustices that were done in their name. A persuasive counter argument would need facts that without the riot the communities of color were receiving significant improvements that were stopped or reversed by the Ferguson riots, but the facts don't bare that out. Slavery got replaced by share cropping and Jim Crow; Jim Crow and informal segregation of the North was replaced by the War on Drugs and the prison industrial complex. Each progression offers halting improvements and built in excuse to improve no further. The moderate whites of each era can point to some aspect of the oppression to dispel their culpability or merely complicity in the injustice up until their is some violent outburst. Slavery had John Brown, Bleeding Kansas, and the Civil War. Jim Crow had race riots, assassinations, jury nullifications of lynchings and police brutality. Prison Industrial Complex has riots, poverty draft, and prison violence (there are more male victims of sexual violence than female largely due to prisons). Antebellum Southerners would be making your exact argument about John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry, or Christian Citizen Council defending police brutality towards \"those uppity Negroes\" who refused to bow their heads deserved getting their heads bashed in because always the ones that are being find guilty of crimes (think of the 14 year old that was executed only to be posthumously exonerated 70 years later).

Thank you!\n\n_____\nIt is my contention that the property destruction and disruption of commerce in Ferguson are the only reasons that this issue gained international attention.  We have a democracy that acts almost exclusively in the interests of a small handful of corporate elites and government officials, which causes actual human suffering to be on the back burner.  Other avenues for political redress such as voting and even peaceful protesting by itself (which are ultimately more effective in the end, but typically only after having a flash point or event to rally around) have been largely compromised by corporate interests and strategic incapacitation policing techniques.  There are racially tinged police murders under far less ambiguous circumstances wherein the behavior of the officers is much more difficult to justify that never gained as much traction when protesters hold exclusively peaceful demonstrations, and it underlies our society's perpetual valuing of windows and business over actual human lives.  Moreover, high profile riots make white middle America (which controls the political arena) evaluate the issue.  When White America is afraid that traffic will be blocked, or that their business might be burned/looted, or that a brick might come flying through their living room window, this forces the issue into the public consciousness and varying solutions must be considered.  \n\nMany say that the property destruction opened the issue to easy critiques since many are beholden to heavily indoctrinated notions of bourgeois morality (the old two wrongs don't make a right adage, even when one wrong is a death and the other is property being destroyed/stolen), and while this is true it gave people a cause to rally around.  White America and the media are masterful at rationalizing and ignoring systemic racism and police brutality, and while the #blacklivesmatter is obvious propaganda it has kept the discussion of racist policing in the public discourse since it did grow organically after a high profile police shooting.  The rioters took action which has a strong psychological impact on those for whom the issue resonates.  Taking action (even a less than ideal one) has much weight than people claiming to \"support\" a cause without actually giving anything of themselves to it.\n\nThe tactic of rallying around a murder to highlight racist inequity has been employed since the Classic Civil Rights Era (see the murder of Emmett Till), and people arguing over whether or not the particular murder in question was less than ideal miss the point entirely.  People are talking about the murder, and (even if for a brief second) the issues that sparked the outrage though this more important narrative is tightly controlled by a media apparatus hellbent on fixating on the explosion than the planting and lighting of the bomb that caused it.  Had it been a perfect situation with the cops saying \"nigger\" before shooting a completely sympathetic victim and even if it was video recorded by a very credible witness, the discussion would have easily devolved into \"this particular cop was just a bad egg,\" and the protests got what they wanted when he was fired/convicted.  \n\nBecause of the ambiguity in the Ferguson shooting, the stark contrasts in *perceptions* among blacks and whites becomes a primary issue of contention.  It's not about bad cops getting out of hand on occasion, but about why so many black people have the idea that the cops treat them unfairly or with undue violence.   No one would have even been talking about that had the case been less focused on contradictory narratives, and it would have never even made international news if the police hadn't responded in a militarized fashion to the peaceful protests that were mobilized after the initial riots.  This uproar was never about police militarization or even bad egg cops.  It is about public policies that have created racist law enforcement practices that marginalize and inflame the black community. Not many have said it that articulately, but it's bubbling underneath the surface of the \"national discussion\" on Ferguson.  In an ideal democracy, third party property destruction would perhaps not be a valid form of political voicing, but as blacks are particularly disenfranchised politically and economically in the US, so using militant tactics to express rage at the societal failings I mentioned above are not only inevitably, but necessary.  \n\nEDIT:  I've already responded to a couple of people strawmanning about how the media was mobilized before the rioting after the verdict.

He claims that he suspected Mike of stealing from a store (who hadn't called the police until after Mike's death), yet intitially said he was stopping him for jaywalking.\n\nThere is enough ammunition here to warrant an attempt at justice for this young man's death. The case already had international attention, and I honestly had hope for this movement, until the protesters decided that they'd rather light a city on fire and storm police headquarters then argue with logic and reason.\n\nThey should have simply pressed for a trial, fought peacefully and used the facts they had at their disposal, instead they opted for violence, which only turned allies against them. Honestly I suspect that the violence of these angry mobs was what denied Michael Brown his justice. Now don't get me wrong, something stinks in the Police force, and that something stinks fierce, but the looting and riots only served to drive away potential allies, and make all their supporters look like animals.\n\nIf you really cared about the cause, you would hate these people as I do, for they were the ones that robbed this man of justice.\n\nEDIT: If anyone can come along and prove me wrong about Mike's death being unwarranted, I would be delighted. I would honestly be thrilled to discover that my evidence is faulty, this case brings knots to my stomach."}, {"id": "2quw12", "body": "Please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post.

Diverting these people down a better life path is the right solution; expecting the police to just let themselves get killed by them once they've grown up to be sociopaths is not."}, {"id": "cncto3k", "body": "Some people can\u2019t really wrap their head around the role of protesters in a democratic society.

If you believe an act of civil disobedience is worth the risk, it may ultimately be for the greater good *despite its being illegal*; however, very few besides you would agree that rioting is such an act.\n\n&gt; There is no equivalent right for people to get to the suburbs on time or to be able to buy their coffee at Starbucks in piece.\n\nThere are laws on the books against obstructing traffic on public roads, and Starbucks and shopping malls have the right to expel disruptive customers (or non-customers in the case of the protesters) or face arrest for trespassing.

About 1% of the black population commits violent crimes.\n\nI would say, in the St. Louis area at least, the incidence of criminality among black people is, unfortunately, probably quite a bit higher than 1%. Besides violent crime, St. Louis suffers from a significant amount of nuisance crime: car break-ins, random vandalism, home invasions, shoplifting, etc. Much of this crime is from repeat offenders who drift in and out of jail; they simply don't care. Obviously letting this nuisance crime continue is unacceptable. What is to be done with this underclass is a difficult question as reforming adults is quite a bit more challenging than diverting children from a future of crime.\n\nAll in all, to summarize, I think you should change your view on rioting because rioting hurts genuine social progress, antagonizes potentially sympathetic allies, and often harms the very neighborhoods inhabited by the minorities. If the arguments I and others have made won't dissuade you, I hope for your sake at least that you will refrain from any acts of rioting in the future and also refrain from encouraging others to do so or wax poetic about it being some kind of right.

However, you an still argue that you see it as poor policy. To that I would say:\n\nWhat do we do with seniors who don't have enough money to support themselves? You may (or may not, I have no idea) be ok with letting them starve on the streets, but most people aren't. The reality is, there are going to  be seniors who need support, and the government is going to support these people after they retire. This will require it to collect taxes to do so. What other tax collection do you suggest? Because I think taxing people (and that is what CPP payments are, a tax) and their employers now for their retirement costs makes a lot of sense. It is fair that they pay for their own retirement taxes instead of some future Canadian tax payers paying for it. It also gives time for the tax revenue to grow as investments, meaning less overall needs to be taken. \n\nAnother benefit of the CPP: it is a set aside fund. I don't have too much trust in our government. If supporting seniors came from general revenue, I would be concerned about supporting other seniors my whole working life, then the government cutting off benefits by the time I retire. That would suck. If my tax dollars need to go to funding others' retirement, I want mine funded too. At least the CPP insures I will get paid too. \n\nIf you want to get rid of the CPP, what alternative do you suggest? Politically, I doubt that \"let's just let seniors take care of themselves\" is viable. People won't be ok with news stories about seniors who planned retirement poorly being out on the street. So we will need to generate taxes to support them from somewhere else. What is your better alternative than CPP? \n\nAnd BTW: I too am a responsible saver and investor. I am confident I can find my retirement without government help. But the CPP isn't bad for me. It forces my employer to match my contributions and it gets decent returns, so right there it gives decent returns. It is very safe investment, which means I can be a little riskier with my personal portfolio. And I am not bothered by losing out if I die. I don't care overly much about leaving a huge estate, so it doesn't really  effect me. And the risk of losing out because I die early is balanced by the safety net of having money continue to come if I live longer than my personal retirement planning took into account and I run out of personal money.

What other tax collection do you suggest? Because I think taxing people (and that is what CPP payments are, a tax) and their employers now for their retirement costs makes a lot of sense. It is fair that they pay for their own retirement taxes instead of some future Canadian tax payers paying for it. It also gives time for the tax revenue to grow as investments, meaning less overall needs to be taken. \n\nAnother benefit of the CPP: it is a set aside fund. I don't have too much trust in our government. If supporting seniors came from general revenue, I would be concerned about supporting other seniors my whole working life, then the government cutting off benefits by the time I retire. That would suck. If my tax dollars need to go to funding others' retirement, I want mine funded too. At least the CPP insures I will get paid too. \n\nIf you want to get rid of the CPP, what alternative do you suggest? Politically, I doubt that \"let's just let seniors take care of themselves\" is viable. People won't be ok with news stories about seniors who planned retirement poorly being out on the street. So we will need to generate taxes to support them from somewhere else. What is your better alternative than CPP? \n\nAnd BTW: I too am a responsible saver and investor. I am confident I can find my retirement without government help. But the CPP isn't bad for me. It forces my employer to match my contributions and it gets decent returns, so right there it gives decent returns. It is very safe investment, which means I can be a little riskier with my personal portfolio. And I am not bothered by losing out if I die. I don't care overly much about leaving a huge estate, so it doesn't really  effect me. And the risk of losing out because I die early is balanced by the safety net of having money continue to come if I live longer than my personal retirement planning took into account and I run out of personal money.

You're either going to get raped without a condom or have your face punched in. The only hos I know who survived falling asleep were the ones who were with those weirdo subservient guys who want you to laugh at their small dick and then let them eat you out for half an hour.

If we really wanted to combat human trafficking, we wouldn't drive huamn nature into an underground black market, we'd work to gain as much information as we could, treat people like people, and deal directly with the problem.  You say that prostitution is frequently the only choice for women because of poverty?  Well #1, the same can be said of retail, but religious nuts haven't decided that retail is immoral, and #2, maybe we should try to solve poverty.  And what about those that are genuinely happy with being prostitutes and strippers?  Finally, there's this nebulous \"hurts the community\" thing, but really, that's just a different form of the poverty argument.

First and foremost, it creates an environment where criminals can expect that people will have limited means to defend themselves. This is why violent crime rates in the UK, for example, are higher than the US.

Second, it means that the people who want guns are going to go to more extremes to obtain them, which would drive the black market danger up.\n\n&gt; Explosives\n\nThis is a slightly different topic, as the \"black market\" for explosives is more recipes and designs for homemade ones than it is actually a true black market of professionally made ones.

They often do manual labor, but as they're not legally employed, have no training or minimal training in the areas they're working. Given the dangers of many manual labor jobs, using these \"undocumented workers\" is more dangerous for both the worker and the person or company paying them.\n\n&gt; Child prostitution\n\nNOT SAYING THIS SHOULD BE LEGAL. But, in the interest of discussion, it does create a dangerous environment and black market. I must warn you, this explanation is going to get dark and fucked up. First, it automatically puts certain groups of children at risk. Pedophiles are going to have preferences and traits they find attractive. Certain races or age ranges or genders or whatever. The people who would sell the children are going to know that and target those children for abduction. So right off the bat you're creating a more dangerous situation for the children than if it was legal. If it was legal, (And let's not get into the \"how\", as we know there's really no way for a child to consent), Not only would the children involved not be abused as often or for as long, but the ones involved would probably be treated better, which brings me to point two, the darker of the problems. With a limited number of children, the people selling the children will resort to more extreme measures to keep them silent or keep them from running away. I won't go into detail, but I've read some stories from survivors, and it's graphic. Beyond the sexual abuse, there's often extensive non-sexual physical abuse - Torture and injury, or even death, for being caught after running away or speaking out. (Even long after the fact). And as an end, of course engaging in that sort of illegal activity is going to be more dangerous for the adults involved. But they deserve it, so no sympathy here. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long winded, and heavy response, but I feel like it's too easy to see only the positive side of those bans.

When you criminalize something, anything, you automatically make people who are desperate for that item or service more likely to cause harm to others to obtain it. OP phrased it poorly, but I can kind of see what he's getting at.\n\n&gt; Guns in European cities\n\nWhile the (essentially) total ban on guns in many european cities does reduce the number of gun-related crimes, it also creates two (in my mind, worse) environments. First and foremost, it creates an environment where criminals can expect that people will have limited means to defend themselves. This is why violent crime rates in the UK, for example, are higher than the US. [source, actually very well thought out and decently cited](http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/01/12/fact-checking-ben-swann-is-the-uk-really-5-times-more-violent-than-the-us/). Second, it means that the people who want guns are going to go to more extremes to obtain them, which would drive the black market danger up.\n\n&gt; Explosives\n\nThis is a slightly different topic, as the \"black market\" for explosives is more recipes and designs for homemade ones than it is actually a true black market of professionally made ones. But still, it makes for a FAR more dangerous environment - especially for those that have to deal with the explosives. [This](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/possibly-bomb-laden-n-h-home-tax-evading-couple-sale-article-1.2028420) is the sort of thing I'm talking about. It's a 100 acre compound that's thought to be laden with explosives, but because explosives are so controlled, authorities have no idea what sort of things they might be using. \n\n&gt; Slaves\n\nFortuantely this is something that you could say most of the world has moved on from, right? Wrong. It's just got a different name (in the US): \"Undocumented workers\". I don't know where you're from, so I'll just give a quick summary.

So, first you have to qualify what \"minors\" you're talking about. Are we talking about 6 year olds or 16 year olds who are legally able to consent to sex? Because that's important. If a 16 year old is legally able to consent to sex with someone over the age of 18 (Which is more a technicality than the reality) why could they also not consent to receiving money for it? \n\nBut moving on to the part that is more disturbing - Younger, pre-pubescent children. I think, in the long run, the number of children abused would go down. Why? Because I think that there is a large number of children who wouldn't be abused if their abusers had other options.\n\n Think of cases like MJ, or Jerry Sandusky, or the countless cases of parents abusing their own children. Think of the way that Thailand has turned a blind eye to \"sex tourism\", or the amount of underage prostitution that goes on at the super bowl. I feel like all of these factors have increased the total number of children who are sexually exploited at a young age. I will say that I have no data to back this up (As there's no country where it's legalized) so it's all speculation, but bear with me for a little longer. \n\nIf the abusers that I mentioned had a legal outlet for their actions, they wouldn't be taking advantage of whatever kids they could. Or so I'd like to think. It's a dark take on it, but to me it makes logical sense. If you're Jerry Sandusky and you want to molest little boys, instead of just molesting as many as you can during your camps, you'd do it to the few that were available through legal means. Or maybe not. Who knows. It's not a position I really support, but when I see the stories of how badly that messes someone up for life, I have to think that there's gotta be a way to reduce the number of people who lose their childhood innocence at a young age. Because you can judge those that break the existing law with the heaviest hand possible (and they often do), but it will still happen.

This is especially common with older audiences\n&gt; who don't know how to work torrents or computers for that matter.\n\nIf you want to safely enjoy media in a traditional environment, you will have to pay for it. No questions asked. If you want the movie theater experience, you will have to pay for it, regardless of whether piracy is legal or not. And there are people who do - I am one of them. I love going to the movies with friends, laughing together discussing how good (or terrible) it was afterwards while enjoying a Chipotle burrito. \n\n&gt; But I'm a little skeptical of just saying \"it's the company's fault for \n&gt; being pirated\". It's not technically wrong, but it sort of feels wrong\n&gt; to say a company should design around crimes, rather than target\n&gt; the crimes directly.\n\nIt's only a crime if it stays a crime. But I see what you're trying to say. My only issue with that is that making it a crime results in what we have today - a non-addressing of the issue, wherein people do it anyway because the only way to prevent that by the government would be breaches of privacy so large it would deserve a revolution in and of itself, and occassionally someone gets caught and punished to \"make an example\" when really it just disproportionately punishes one person for the acts of many, possibly bankrupting said person in the process.\n\n&gt; But I'm curious to your solution, though. Can we discuss that? What\n&gt; do you think is wrong with the current system, and what would you &gt; have instead?\n\nAs I said above, the problem with the current system is that it's little more than a de jure solution that does little in practice except occassionally bankrupt people and waste the time of the FBI chasing digital pirates instead of pursuing actually dangerous criminals (yeah, the FBI are the ones that chase those guys down). Frankly, making it not a crime lets the FBI get back to their job of dealing with terrorists, bank robbers, art thieves, etc. As for why piracy exists, it's the consumer's way of indirectly stating that they have wants and needs that companies are not addressing. \"Your goods are overpriced.\" \"Your goods don't work well enough.\" \"We want purchasing to be more convenient.\" Lawsuits are a company's way of not addressing these and still making money, which sounds ludicrous to me.\n\nPeople already find piracy distasteful - they have to browse sites where they're constantly bombarded with all kinds of intrusive/distasteful ads, where they have to hunt for \"the right\" version that has the subtitles/features/whatever they want, go through a vetting process to ensure that it doesn't also include the latest strain of Windows HIV, before getting it. It is a time-consuming, annoying, at times horrifying, and dangerous process that could be avoided by taking a walk to the local Best Buy, Gamestop, or whatever place still sells physical music albums. And somehow, this is still more convenient. People are willing to go through the trouble and take those risks. I think that says something.\n\nCountermeasures to can be found for many industries, some fairly easily. For example, if we're dealing with physical CDs, have them be signed by the artist/one of the band members. Boom. Problem solved. Obviously, you'd have a problem then with people signing things while on tour, but that seems like an easy enough problem to address. Alternatively, tie it to a service like iTunes, but then give them an actual reason to deal with iTunes' bullshit (also, get rid of iTunes' bullshit, but that's for later). For example, an extra track that functions similar to the \"bought new DLC\" for video games: it can only be accessed if you bought the album new/online and is only available to you while you're tied to the service (functionally similar to Spotify blocking your ability to listen to songs that are actually cached on your computer when it doesn't detect an Internet connection). Alternatively: SPOTIFY! People don't pirate when they have Spotify. Oftentimes I leave my Spotify playlist running even when I'm not listening because it still earns the artist/studio royalties. Doesn't cost me anything, and I'm happy to help. Moreover, they still get money from licensing it to radio stations and such, so they still have alternative revenue streams unaffected by piracy.\n\nVideo games have already figured it out because they hurt a lot more from used games markets than others (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G_f8YBy39M). Those same measures also address piracy, and, if emphasized further, would be pretty effective measures. This, combined with services like Steam and Origin, which allow you to play the game on many computers whenever you feel like it and are capable of downloading it, address the convenience issue. Moreover, with the advent of Steam and Origin, you'll find sales a lot more often - for example, Dragon Age Inquisition, which came out less than 2 months ago, has already gone on sale twice (one of which, I believe, is currently running) for 25% or more, which addresses the \"cost\" issue. So, like I said, it seems the games industry is already on the path to figuring this out, and their sales reflect this, as they still break sales records regularly, year to year.\n\nWhat about movies? Well, we have Netflix. And Sony has shown with The Interview that you can distribute movie-ticket-like experiences with the at-home convenience over the Internet (you can watch it through YouTube by \"buying\" it there). So set up a service (maybe added on to Netflix) that lets you watch a newly released movie online once upon release. That is, letting you buy a \"digital movie ticket\" for a new release. You can watch it at home with your family on your sofa or on your bed. In any case, movie theaters make the large majority of their money not off of tickets, but concessions, so it likely won't hurt them too much (and if it does hurt them, they'll have to figure out a way to make up that lost revenue, but we're not talking about them right now). I can't think of a DVD purchase solution off the top of my head, but I'm sure one can be found (besides Netflix, I mean). And, just as with music, they still make money through syndication to TV channels, rentals, etc.\n\nDid I miss anything?"}, {"id": "cna4jem", "body": "What's the alternative then?

"}, {"id": "cn9twqh", "body": "It depends on the product in question, and the nature of the demand for it, so that I'd say you need to redefine your CMV. For some things making it illegal is really effective in keeping people from getting it, while for other things it just pushes the behavior underground, which often does more harm than good. I would say the main determinant between an illegal product being actually removed by a prohibition is whether you can make it culturally taboo. But do you want us to argue that in every case prohibition is a useful way to curb a behavior, or that in some cases it is a useful way to curb a behavior?\n\nIn response to your edit: with firearms, prohibition actually does seem to be great at lowering violent deaths overall. This is because firearms can only be produced by legitimate manufacturers (people only use name-brand guns, there does not seem to be a black-market factory molding and producing its own firearms) so that if you control guns at the source, making sure they are only sold to police and military, it really drives up the price of guns for criminals. A criminal can't buy or steal someone's second-hand $200 personal revolver/shotgun, they have to bribe or steal from the police, military, or manufacturer which is a serious and costly undertaking. This effectively means most criminals can't get them. Police in European cities generally do not expect to face guns when going out on a call, in sharp contrast to the US.\n\nWith prostitution you're probably right that since it's always been around the best thing to do is regulate it to make sure people aren't being pimped and are being kept healthy.\n\nDitto with abortion, it's a service that is always in need, and it should be available.\n\nDitto, in my opinion, with alcohol and soft-drugs like pot, where even if using it too much is harmful, making using it illegal just makes the harm worse by forcing it underground, putting an unregulated and less safe product on the market, and gives huge numbers of ordinary, decent people a criminal record for benign and common behavior.\n\nWith hard drugs its more debatable. The junkie dependance it creates is serious enough that it might be worth criminalizing it. Being extremely habit forming, hard drugs are very profitable to sell, and companies would advertise and promote a product that has guaranteed repeat customers, which likely would increase hard drug use. Imagine brand-name cocaine commercials on TV like for alcohol, making it cool and sexy, watchable by anyone in front of that TV. It's virtually impossible to incorporate heroin or PCP into a happy life,  and these substances make you a danger to those around you. Governments can legitimately regulate activity with huge negative externalities. \n\nSo like I said, it depends on which specific product or service you have in mind, and general statements aren't much use. Sometimes making something illegal curtails its use, subject to how that product is created and distributed and the cultural approval or disapproval of that thing, and sometimes it will just create huge black markets."}, {"id": "2qu6fg", "body": "Making something illegal doesn't make people want it any less, there has only been a deterrent created.

Two is that people don't understand how false positives work. The fact that your niece's school apparently allowed you to have a *new*  sample tested is proof that they don't understand the science of drug testing.

Don't fight drug testing itself--the Supreme Court has already ruled on this. Fight the anti-science policy. It should be the default behavior for a school to perform a confirmation using divided samples if the student requests it, though it may be impossible to avoid bearing the brunt of the cost of such tests, especially if they are to be performed at a different lab.

Moreover, the Queen is not just ceremonial - [she has real powers.](http://www.republic.org.uk/what-we-want/monarchy-myth-buster/it-has-no-power-%E2%80%93-its-just-decoration) Plus[ what Charles has been trying to do](http://www.princeofwales.info/node/3) is freaky.\n\n&gt;That's one advantage to having a separate, ceremonial head of state that reserves certain royal prerogatives.\n\nI fail to see how that's an advantage.

We have this horrible connotation that discrimination is always bad, but look around there's plenty of it already. We have separate bathrooms based on gender, separate schools that folks can choose to send their children to ect. The key here is equality. A women's shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they're a good thing. However that is not to say we should not make these resources available to male victims of abuse in the same capacity. Unfortunately I don't really know of any male support groups for abuse survivors out there, but I think we should certainly have them.\n\nA personal example of this that I can speak of came from my work. A little background I work at a public shooting range that in addition to holding public hours provides a number of free classes to people. Most of the classes are open to everyone but we have a few that are exclusively women's only classes. Our rationale is that when a female starts getting into firearms it can be very intimidating to shoot with a bunch of guys standing around watching. Because folks lets face it hunting and the shooting sports are primarily dominated by men. (There are tons of female shooters out there, just not near as many). So at one point we were short handed so I asked one of our volunteer instructors to come out and help. He said he could not in good conscious participate in a class that segregated by gender when there was no male equivalent (although he understood our reasoning for it). This didn't sit well with me, and made me think a lot. I started noticing that while I was helping some male customers in a shooting situation they seemed a bit put off. I'm the only girl that works at the range, and I feel that these particular men might have had some sort of aversion to me helping them. I mean stereotypically they should have been the ones who knew what they were doing, not some girl in her early twenties. I talked to my guy friends and they said that some guys might just have been embarrassed by getting instruction on what is seen as a masculine activity from a woman. Until that point I had never really thought about it, I was there to help whatever struggling shooters that needed help. \n\nSo we decided to do something about it. We now in addition to the woman's only class have a \"Guy's day at the range\" course. We didn't think it would do well but it has filled up just as quickly as the women's courses and has received good feedback!
