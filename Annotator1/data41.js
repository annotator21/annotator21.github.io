If the conflict was solely about territory, then the Palestinians would have accepted either Baraks offer at Camp David; the Clinton-parameters; or Olmerts offer in 2008. But the fact that they keep insisting on the right of return, which there is absolutely no way Israel will (or should) concede, means that a peace agreement is nowhere in sight.\n\nA two state solution is fundamentally incompatible with the right of return, since it will potentially be the end of Jewish majority in the state of Israel. Which is why most proponents of the two state solution - certainly the US, but also I would suspect most European countries - reject the right of return. Given that the two state solution is the preferred solution to the conflict by the international community, I cannot fathom why there isn't put any more effort into solving the Palestinian refugee problem.\n\nUNRWA, who provides relief for the Palestinian refugees, has been a disaster for the conflict. Rather than attempting to solve the problem, by resettling the refugees in their current host countries, UNRWA maintains the refugee status for the Palestinians. Worse than that, unlike other refugees in the world, UNRWA passes on the refugee status to the descendants of the refugees. Which means that a refugee problem has grown from about 700.000 back in 1948 to more than 5 million today. Even worse, UNRWA indoctrinates the Palestinian refugees with the idea of right of return, meaning that the next generation of children will still demand the right of return to a country in which neither they nor their parents ever set foot.\n\nThe big losers in all of this is of course the Palestinians themselves. Who now languish in the refugee camps. Being second class citizens in the very countries in which they - and their parents - grew up in. All for a fantasy about a glorious right of return that will never happen.\n\nMy argument is in essence the following: **If you genuinely support a two state solution, you should be opposed to the right of return. If you are opposed to the right of return, you should insist that steps be taken to diminish - or flat out solve - the refugee problem, by resettling the refugees in the countries in which they currently live.**\n\nThis will of course not be an easy task. It will take quite some effort to convince the Arab countries to do this, but the international community could put pressure on these states, and provide the necessary funds to make it happen. I it will require that the UNRWA mandate is radically changed, such that it will henceforth work towards resettling the refugees. The very first step should be to change the ludicrous practice of granting refugee status to the descendants of the refugees, which alone will gradually minimize the problem. Of course if the UNRWA mandate is changed so radically, one wonders why it isn't just abolished all together, and the refugees are handed over to UNHCR. That might not be practically possible in the short run though, since UNRWA has become a de-facto state for the refugees. But the ultimate goal should clearly be to end UNRWA.\n\nThe reason why I am writing this, is because the resettling of the refugees seems like the most obvious step that should be taken in order to resolve the conflict. Therefore it mystifies me why there isn't any more effort put into it. If there cannot be a two state solution until this problem is solved, then why on earth is nobody doing anything about it? Even if you believe that the Palestinians should be allowed to return, you have to face the fact that it is not going to happen, and to keep the refugees in their current situation in spite of that, is simply inhumane.\n\nEDIT: To the people pointing out how hypocritical it is of me to want the Arabs to relinquish the right of return, when the jews were given that right of return by the internation community back when Palestine was primarily Arab: *How exactly is that relevant to anything I wrote?* Where did I write that I thought the creation of Israel was a good idea? I am arguing for a pragmatic solution to the conflict as it is, in the context of a two state solution. I am not really interested in debating whether the jewish state was a good idea in the first place.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

With regards to the Israeli settlers, then yes I think a lot of them will have to be resettled in Israel proper - forcefully if need be. It was done in Gaza in 2005 and it could be done again."}, {"id": "2qd2ig", "body": "The main reason the two state solution has not yet been achieved is due to the Palestinians insistence on the right of return of the Palestinian refugees and their descendants, who were displaced during the 1948 war. If the conflict was solely about territory, then the Palestinians would have accepted either Baraks offer at Camp David; the Clinton-parameters; or Olmerts offer in 2008. But the fact that they keep insisting on the right of return, which there is absolutely no way Israel will (or should) concede, means that a peace agreement is nowhere in sight.\n\nA two state solution is fundamentally incompatible with the right of return, since it will potentially be the end of Jewish majority in the state of Israel. Which is why most proponents of the two state solution - certainly the US, but also I would suspect most European countries - reject the right of return. Given that the two state solution is the preferred solution to the conflict by the international community, I cannot fathom why there isn't put any more effort into solving the Palestinian refugee problem.\n\nUNRWA, who provides relief for the Palestinian refugees, has been a disaster for the conflict. Rather than attempting to solve the problem, by resettling the refugees in their current host countries, UNRWA maintains the refugee status for the Palestinians. Worse than that, unlike other refugees in the world, UNRWA passes on the refugee status to the descendants of the refugees. Which means that a refugee problem has grown from about 700.000 back in 1948 to more than 5 million today. Even worse, UNRWA indoctrinates the Palestinian refugees with the idea of right of return, meaning that the next generation of children will still demand the right of return to a country in which neither they nor their parents ever set foot.\n\nThe big losers in all of this is of course the Palestinians themselves. Who now languish in the refugee camps. Being second class citizens in the very countries in which they - and their parents - grew up in. All for a fantasy about a glorious right of return that will never happen.\n\nMy argument is in essence the following: **If you genuinely support a two state solution, you should be opposed to the right of return. If you are opposed to the right of return, you should insist that steps be taken to diminish - or flat out solve - the refugee problem, by resettling the refugees in the countries in which they currently live.**\n\nThis will of course not be an easy task. It will take quite some effort to convince the Arab countries to do this, but the international community could put pressure on these states, and provide the necessary funds to make it happen. I it will require that the UNRWA mandate is radically changed, such that it will henceforth work towards resettling the refugees. The very first step should be to change the ludicrous practice of granting refugee status to the descendants of the refugees, which alone will gradually minimize the problem. Of course if the UNRWA mandate is changed so radically, one wonders why it isn't just abolished all together, and the refugees are handed over to UNHCR. That might not be practically possible in the short run though, since UNRWA has become a de-facto state for the refugees. But the ultimate goal should clearly be to end UNRWA.\n\nThe reason why I am writing this, is because the resettling of the refugees seems like the most obvious step that should be taken in order to resolve the conflict. Therefore it mystifies me why there isn't any more effort put into it. If there cannot be a two state solution until this problem is solved, then why on earth is nobody doing anything about it? Even if you believe that the Palestinians should be allowed to return, you have to face the fact that it is not going to happen, and to keep the refugees in their current situation in spite of that, is simply inhumane.\n\nEDIT: To the people pointing out how hypocritical it is of me to want the Arabs to relinquish the right of return, when the jews were given that right of return by the internation community back when Palestine was primarily Arab: *How exactly is that relevant to anything I wrote?* Where did I write that I thought the creation of Israel was a good idea? I am arguing for a pragmatic solution to the conflict as it is, in the context of a two state solution. I am not really interested in debating whether the jewish state was a good idea in the first place.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If the conflict was solely about territory, then the Palestinians would have accepted either Baraks offer at Camp David; the Clinton-parameters; or Olmerts offer in 2008. But the fact that they keep insisting on the right of return, which there is absolutely no way Israel will (or should) concede, means that a peace agreement is nowhere in sight.\n\nA two state solution is fundamentally incompatible with the right of return, since it will potentially be the end of Jewish majority in the state of Israel. Which is why most proponents of the two state solution - certainly the US, but also I would suspect most European countries - reject the right of return. Given that the two state solution is the preferred solution to the conflict by the international community, I cannot fathom why there isn't put any more effort into solving the Palestinian refugee problem.\n\nUNRWA, who provides relief for the Palestinian refugees, has been a disaster for the conflict. Rather than attempting to solve the problem, by resettling the refugees in their current host countries, UNRWA maintains the refugee status for the Palestinians. Worse than that, unlike other refugees in the world, UNRWA passes on the refugee status to the descendants of the refugees. Which means that a refugee problem has grown from about 700.000 back in 1948 to more than 5 million today. Even worse, UNRWA indoctrinates the Palestinian refugees with the idea of right of return, meaning that the next generation of children will still demand the right of return to a country in which neither they nor their parents ever set foot.\n\nThe big losers in all of this is of course the Palestinians themselves. Who now languish in the refugee camps. Being second class citizens in the very countries in which they - and their parents - grew up in. All for a fantasy about a glorious right of return that will never happen.\n\nMy argument is in essence the following: **If you genuinely support a two state solution, you should be opposed to the right of return. If you are opposed to the right of return, you should insist that steps be taken to diminish - or flat out solve - the refugee problem, by resettling the refugees in the countries in which they currently live.**\n\nThis will of course not be an easy task. It will take quite some effort to convince the Arab countries to do this, but the international community could put pressure on these states, and provide the necessary funds to make it happen. I it will require that the UNRWA mandate is radically changed, such that it will henceforth work towards resettling the refugees. The very first step should be to change the ludicrous practice of granting refugee status to the descendants of the refugees, which alone will gradually minimize the problem. Of course if the UNRWA mandate is changed so radically, one wonders why it isn't just abolished all together, and the refugees are handed over to UNHCR. That might not be practically possible in the short run though, since UNRWA has become a de-facto state for the refugees. But the ultimate goal should clearly be to end UNRWA.\n\nThe reason why I am writing this, is because the resettling of the refugees seems like the most obvious step that should be taken in order to resolve the conflict. Therefore it mystifies me why there isn't any more effort put into it. If there cannot be a two state solution until this problem is solved, then why on earth is nobody doing anything about it? Even if you believe that the Palestinians should be allowed to return, you have to face the fact that it is not going to happen, and to keep the refugees in their current situation in spite of that, is simply inhumane.\n\nEDIT: To the people pointing out how hypocritical it is of me to want the Arabs to relinquish the right of return, when the jews were given that right of return by the internation community back when Palestine was primarily Arab: *How exactly is that relevant to anything I wrote?* Where did I write that I thought the creation of Israel was a good idea? I am arguing for a pragmatic solution to the conflict as it is, in the context of a two state solution. I am not really interested in debating whether the jewish state was a good idea in the first place.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But the fact that they keep insisting on the right of return, which there is absolutely no way Israel will (or should) concede, means that a peace agreement is nowhere in sight.\n\nA two state solution is fundamentally incompatible with the right of return, since it will potentially be the end of Jewish majority in the state of Israel. Which is why most proponents of the two state solution - certainly the US, but also I would suspect most European countries - reject the right of return. Given that the two state solution is the preferred solution to the conflict by the international community, I cannot fathom why there isn't put any more effort into solving the Palestinian refugee problem.\n\nUNRWA, who provides relief for the Palestinian refugees, has been a disaster for the conflict. Rather than attempting to solve the problem, by resettling the refugees in their current host countries, UNRWA maintains the refugee status for the Palestinians. Worse than that, unlike other refugees in the world, UNRWA passes on the refugee status to the descendants of the refugees. Which means that a refugee problem has grown from about 700.000 back in 1948 to more than 5 million today.

If you are opposed to the right of return, you should insist that steps be taken to diminish - or flat out solve - the refugee problem, by resettling the refugees in the countries in which they currently live.**\n\nThis will of course not be an easy task. It will take quite some effort to convince the Arab countries to do this, but the international community could put pressure on these states, and provide the necessary funds to make it happen. I it will require that the UNRWA mandate is radically changed, such that it will henceforth work towards resettling the refugees. The very first step should be to change the ludicrous practice of granting refugee status to the descendants of the refugees, which alone will gradually minimize the problem. Of course if the UNRWA mandate is changed so radically, one wonders why it isn't just abolished all together, and the refugees are handed over to UNHCR. That might not be practically possible in the short run though, since UNRWA has become a de-facto state for the refugees. But the ultimate goal should clearly be to end UNRWA.\n\nThe reason why I am writing this, is because the resettling of the refugees seems like the most obvious step that should be taken in order to resolve the conflict. Therefore it mystifies me why there isn't any more effort put into it. If there cannot be a two state solution until this problem is solved, then why on earth is nobody doing anything about it? Even if you believe that the Palestinians should be allowed to return, you have to face the fact that it is not going to happen, and to keep the refugees in their current situation in spite of that, is simply inhumane.\n\nEDIT: To the people pointing out how hypocritical it is of me to want the Arabs to relinquish the right of return, when the jews were given that right of return by the internation community back when Palestine was primarily Arab: *How exactly is that relevant to anything I wrote?* Where did I write that I thought the creation of Israel was a good idea? I am arguing for a pragmatic solution to the conflict as it is, in the context of a two state solution.

If the conflict was solely about territory, then the Palestinians would have accepted either Baraks offer at Camp David; the Clinton-parameters; or Olmerts offer in 2008. But the fact that they keep insisting on the right of return, which there is absolutely no way Israel will (or should) concede, means that a peace agreement is nowhere in sight.\n\nA two state solution is fundamentally incompatible with the right of return, since it will potentially be the end of Jewish majority in the state of Israel. Which is why most proponents of the two state solution - certainly the US, but also I would suspect most European countries - reject the right of return. Given that the two state solution is the preferred solution to the conflict by the international community, I cannot fathom why there isn't put any more effort into solving the Palestinian refugee problem.\n\nUNRWA, who provides relief for the Palestinian refugees, has been a disaster for the conflict. Rather than attempting to solve the problem, by resettling the refugees in their current host countries, UNRWA maintains the refugee status for the Palestinians. Worse than that, unlike other refugees in the world, UNRWA passes on the refugee status to the descendants of the refugees. Which means that a refugee problem has grown from about 700.000 back in 1948 to more than 5 million today. Even worse, UNRWA indoctrinates the Palestinian refugees with the idea of right of return, meaning that the next generation of children will still demand the right of return to a country in which neither they nor their parents ever set foot.\n\nThe big losers in all of this is of course the Palestinians themselves. Who now languish in the refugee camps. Being second class citizens in the very countries in which they - and their parents - grew up in. All for a fantasy about a glorious right of return that will never happen.\n\nMy argument is in essence the following: **If you genuinely support a two state solution, you should be opposed to the right of return. If you are opposed to the right of return, you should insist that steps be taken to diminish - or flat out solve - the refugee problem, by resettling the refugees in the countries in which they currently live.**\n\nThis will of course not be an easy task. It will take quite some effort to convince the Arab countries to do this, but the international community could put pressure on these states, and provide the necessary funds to make it happen. I it will require that the UNRWA mandate is radically changed, such that it will henceforth work towards resettling the refugees. The very first step should be to change the ludicrous practice of granting refugee status to the descendants of the refugees, which alone will gradually minimize the problem. Of course if the UNRWA mandate is changed so radically, one wonders why it isn't just abolished all together, and the refugees are handed over to UNHCR. That might not be practically possible in the short run though, since UNRWA has become a de-facto state for the refugees. But the ultimate goal should clearly be to end UNRWA.\n\nThe reason why I am writing this, is because the resettling of the refugees seems like the most obvious step that should be taken in order to resolve the conflict. Therefore it mystifies me why there isn't any more effort put into it. If there cannot be a two state solution until this problem is solved, then why on earth is nobody doing anything about it? Even if you believe that the Palestinians should be allowed to return, you have to face the fact that it is not going to happen, and to keep the refugees in their current situation in spite of that, is simply inhumane.\n\nEDIT: To the people pointing out how hypocritical it is of me to want the Arabs to relinquish the right of return, when the jews were given that right of return by the internation community back when Palestine was primarily Arab: *How exactly is that relevant to anything I wrote?* Where did I write that I thought the creation of Israel was a good idea? I am arguing for a pragmatic solution to the conflict as it is, in the context of a two state solution. I am not really interested in debating whether the jewish state was a good idea in the first place.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If I had to guess, I'd say that it will probably play out something like this:\n\n* Adult woman meets underage boy who really doesn't look underage (which is a real thing that happens. Plenty of people are significantly older or younger than they appear).\n* She convinces herself (consciously or unconsciously is irrelevant) that because he looks like an adult, he is an adult, and it's alright to act on her attraction. Viewers will find this plausible because the actor is obviously an adult.\n* After they have sex, the 17-old will react to things like a 17-year-old instead of like an adult. The dissonance between his adult appearance and adolescent behavior will be disconcerting because it will hammer home (to both the viewers and the woman) that the dude is a teenager and what the woman is doing is wrong. \n* Viewers will be sympathetic to the woman because they can see the logical chain of events that led her to that point, but they'll also be somewhat appalled at what she's done. These two distinct views of the character will work in concert to develop a more interesting narrative that forces the viewer to consider how a logical chain of events can lead to immoral behavior.\n\nHaving the actor appear to be an adult is actually essential to achieving this dissonance. If the actor looks like a typical 17-year-old, it will be harder for the audience to relate to the woman since they'll get hung up on the steps where she becomes attracted to the teen and decides that it's acceptable to act on her attraction. With an older actor, it's easier for the audience to see how she could be attracted without necessarily being a pedophile(/ephebophile, for the pedants waiting in the wings), and thus easier to understand her acting on that attraction.\n\n\nIf you still can't buy it, try this interpretation of the movie: The teen actually looks like a teen, but the film is portraying the woman's mental picture of him, which looks older than he actually looks. This adds a layer of self-delusion to the woman's character, where she tries to justify her inappropriate urges by fooling herself into thinking that the adolescent she's attracted to is *really* an adult. I think it's less likely to be correct, but it's a second directorial choice that could only be accomplished by going with an actor who doesn't appear to be the actual age of the character."}, {"id": "2qcyli", "body": "Just saw the [trailer for the Boy Next Door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrE97rY7ZKo) in theater, and was astounded.

To be quite frank, we are the most naive/easily manipulated/trusting creatures between the ages of 13 and 18. Pretty much all of my friends have undergone some sort of abuse as teens because, well, nobody taught us haw to draw the lines in domestic relationships. Sexually or otherwise. We let people into our lives and then get hurt. It's part of becoming a woman, sadly. Do us all a favor and let us figure it all out with others our age. For example, my first boss was almost 10 years older than me. He played it off really nice at first and he gained my trust quickly. I thought he was my friend. It wasn't long before he started inviting me out nonstop, making inappropriate flirtatious gestures, texting me often, getting a boner while hugging me, etc. Situations like that are extremely scary and confusing for us because we see older men as people who are supposed to protect us, not manipulate or use us. If you find girls my age attractive, it's no big deal. Just please, if you are over 19, just leave us alone. Biology isn't everything. Girls can get their periods between 9 and 11 years old. I got mine when I was 11. Do you think I was suddenly ready to have sex and become a mother then? God no. The thought of sex at that age terrified me. It wasn't until I was 16 that I was ready to have sex with my boyfriend of OVER A YEAR, and even then the anxiety was terrible for awhile.

So appearances are definitely not enough.  It is true that some of them are perfectly prepared for sexual relationships and can handle it better than some adults, but it's very hard to filter out when it's a pose and then it's genuine mental maturity.  \n\nSo, finding them attractive is already a first step one should try to discourage, but is in itself harmless unless it leads to a second step where this attraction is expressed in some way, like a gesture, a comment or even a declaration.  From there to taking some action that can cause damage it gets only closer every time to the point it can become illegal and immoral pretty fast.  Merely not preventing one of them hitting on you is already a liability.  \n\nI would say just looking and going \"oh wow, I'd better keep my distance\" is harmless.
