That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, or that science accepts absence of knowledge as absence of a phenomena. It's the Dark Matter/Energy of neuroscience. Citing neuroscience for something they're having difficulty even approaching is really sloppy and an abuse of science in general. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and neuroscience is in its infancy; if not a fetus. I find it difficult to take any comment on free will seriously even from those at the top of the field, let alone on the net. I mean this completely seriously: How can you be okay with saying anything on free will and attribute it to anything but your opinion with a straight face?\n\nI know that sounds mean but that's not a rhetorical question; do you appreciate how low a tier of knowledge the top scientists in this field really are?\n\nI'd encourage you look into Dr. Jordan Peterson's lecture series regarding mental illness and the idea of \"being\" to mental health. His students have put him on YouTube. He regularly demonstrates how, in practice, most mental illness is the result of consistently choosing to ignore day-to-day existential and biological responsibilities and drives, and using your will to ignore, lie about, and divert actual challenges to live in an ever-growing delusion that eventually crashes at mach 5 into reality. His \"reality always catches up\" model is extremely compelling, and the ability to cheat even one's self into madness should be an indicator of the existence of free will. He speaks a great deal about common attitudes, drives, and biological motivators, and how people overwrite them all the time and go mad or work to drive somebody else nuts. The idea being that free will is most often used as a bad thing and to work against otherwise clever psychological systems meant to help. The idea that people have the capacity to go insane and work against themselves and their experience should give you pause.\n\nAlso it doesn't help your thinking-outside-the-box that you don't live in a country or time where people are flayed alive for their beliefs. If you could see the hardcore monks of not long ago, in their efforts to demonstrate the force of their will through denying all bodily everything, and even emotional and intellectual drives, you might be a little slower to falsely associating neuroscience to being conclusive regarding a field it's still figuring out how to scratch.\n\nEven a generation ago in India there were swamis that spent their whole lives sedentary, saying and doing nothing. In my world religious study, I met [Rabi Maharaj](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_Maharaj), former Indian god who's dad never moved or spoke a word--his father died when taken for a haircut by doctor's orders. Said lifestyle was completely willed and is not uncommon in ego cults in the East and West.\n\nAnyway, even if you bloat neuroscience well beyond its current horizons and say that you've found the biological mechanism for choice, that doesn't discount free will because that doesn't ensure the system is predictable or based entirely in reactions within Newtonian physics."}, {"id": "2r0eyf", "body": "With our ever advancing knowledge of neuroscience and the chemistry involved with it, I do not see any place for the idea that any animal, including humans, is truly capable of making choices.

It's a bit of a stretch to say it's a story about transgenderism in the bible, but it still might be useful to bring up in this conversation. \n\nAs a Sunday school teacher, I'm sure you aware that Genesis 1 and 2 present two different creation stories that, on the surface, are difficult to reconcile. In Genesis 1 : 27-28, man and woman are created simultaneously, after the animals: \n\n&gt;\"So God created humankind in his image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\"\n\nIn Genesis 2, we get the classic Adam and Eve story, where womankind is created from Adam's rib.\n\nThis is a classic hermeneutic problem. One early attempt to reconcile these two stories is the myth of the androgyne. Basically, religious scholars posited that, in Genesis 1, God creates an androgynous being that is simultaneously male and female, and that androgynous being is Adam (hence, \"God created them; male and female he created them). Genesis 2 doesn't describe a separate creation of mankind; it describes the creation of genders, in the moment in which God splits Adam into Male and Female halves. Thus, the two stories are reconciled.\n\nAccounts differ on whether or not the androgyn is literal and physical or not. Philo says the primal androgyne is totally incorporeal, and that Genesis 2 describes God giving him* a physical, gendered body. The Palestinian midrash contends that the androgynous Adam created in Genesis 1 is an actual physical being with both male and female genitalia.  His* genitalia is literally separated into male and female halves in Genesis 2. \n\nLike I said, saying this is a story about transgenderism is clearly a stretch. But it is a story about a being who has a vagina and is a man, and has a penis and is a woman (because he has both, and he is both). And it is a story about a being becoming gendered (becoming a man) by losing a vagina and a being becoming a woman by losing a penis. \n\nIn one sense, as an interpretation of the bible, it seems to reinforce biological gender. The male and female genders are created by splitting off the genitalia into separate beings. On the other hand, it describes a certain degree of fluidity in gender, and furthermore asserts that, at the primal moment of creation, man and woman were one, and gender was meaningless, which I think could be interpreted as an argument *against* rigid biological gender categories, or even the importance of gender to begin with.\n\n*I'm using the male pronoun to describe the androgyne, because that is what these scholars would use. \n\nEDIT: thinking about this more, because it's a very interesting question. If you are looking for biblical justification for transgenderism, Genesis 2 seems useful in general. The story of Adam describes a woman being made from the body of a man (his rib). Again, this is all very much a stretch, but isn't this already a description of a transgender surgery: making the body of a female out of the body of a male? Isn't there already a degree of gender fluidity implicit in the idea that God makes woman out of the body of a man, insofar as it implies that both genders contain the essence of and/or potential to become the other? If Eve is created from Adam, doesn't that already suggest that all men contain in their bodies the female potential? \n\nA lot of queer theorist would probably balk at this equivocation--they would say that a transgender individual isn't a person who has been made a woman out of a man, but was a woman to begin with, and is merely identifying as their true gender (or vice versa). That being said, if we're trying to find justification for transgenderism in the Old Testament, we should probably take what we can get. \n\nI think the Biblical treatment of eunuchs in Isiah and Matthew 19:10 are also maybe relevant to the discussion. I understand OP is probably getting flooded with responses right now. I don't want to type out another huge paragraph if it's going to get buried. But if OP responds, and wants to talk about the treatment of eunuchs, I'd write something up.\n\nAnyways, if OP does see this, I just want to say: thanks for a fascinating CMV!

In one era, we believe that a finite number of elements exists, until someone comes along to discover radioactivity that ultimately leads down the road to a new era in which new elements can be made by exotic processes. The fundamentals are always changing.  \n\nFurthermore, science carries with it no imperative regarding how you should live your life or what is spiritually fulfilling. The idea of spirituality is not really addressable by science because it's not a topic that is really open to an evidence-based analysis. \n\nRegarding contradictions then, science is filled with them. These contradictions are the means by which science changes itself and moves forward. There are competing viewpoints from which a victor emerged only to subject itself to further inquiry and doubt. If science cannot achieve perfection, it doesn't make sense to expect spiritual traditions started 2000 years ago to have it down (not everyone agrees with me on this point...just like not everyone in science agrees on the significance of certain topics). \n\nAny faith tradition has within it the possibility of creating your own moral compass; I am not speaking from the standpoint that Christianity has any spiritual superiority. The advantage that Christianity has, however, is a unique text that is highly accessible to huge swathes of the population and has a revolutionary tenet at its foundation. It is not rocket science. It's simplicity is something that Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism do not have.\n\nRegarding your comment on the atheist before the time of Christ - I don't think that it is possible for someone who actively denies the possibility of something beyond himself and physical reality to use a moral compass to come to a conclusion that is opposite to his foundational belief. He may have a sense of morality that we can agree with, but since he has no interest in an external entity, what does it matter to him to use his faculties to explore that possibility? Morality and spirituality are distinct things. A very spiritual man can do things that are morally repugnant. \n\nBut regarding a spiritual blank slate, Christianity does indeed believe in one - in my opinion, the concept you are referring to is why Jesus was referred to as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek. Jesus was not of a priestly lineage; Melchizedek was not Jewish, he was an obscure mystic in the time of Abraham to whom Abraham gave 10% of his holdings because Melchizedek provided some very important spiritual guidance that indicated that he was very close to God. He is hardly mentioned in the Old Testament, and yet Jesus is said to be of his priestly lineage. Why? I personally believe it is because it is emblematic of a spiritual tradition that is as close to a blank slate as possible, the spirituality that existed in the time of Abraham before there were laws. \n\nBut then why is Christianity or the Bible important? Because it's clear over and over again that humans will constantly try to use any means necessary to invoke divine support of laws and precepts to support their own position, usually to the detriment of others. I think it is important to have a foundational text that embraces the idea of contradictions, unresolved questions, and above all a personal connection with the unknown so that the message for which Jesus died cannot be fundamentally corrupted. It is not a rule book, it is not a magic formula for making your life amazing - the book doesn't claim to be because it can't be.

"}, {"id": "cnbba8j", "body": "Just so we are clear - I said \"nearly\" because some Catholics have a complicated perception of sin insofar as it refers to Mary. \n\nI have read the New Testament and know that not everything is as set in stone as you say it is. Your definition of evangelism is different from what you are doing. Evangelism isn't pointing at people and telling them how blasphemous they are. It isn't about pointing to people and making them feel like sinners. In fact, Romans 14 asks us to walk in another person's shoes and accept the non-canonical tenets of their particular faith even if we have a personal disagreement with it:\n\nRomans 14:1-9\n&gt;Accept the one whose faith is weak,without quarreling over disputable matters. One person\u2019s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them. Who are you to judge someone else\u2019s servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.\n\n&gt;One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind. Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God;and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.\n\nWith respect to Jesus setting forth \"new law\" I disagree with you completely. Paul spends a significant amount of time speaking with the Galatians about the law with respect to Christ and he says to them in (Galatians 2:18-19) and then also in (Galatians 3:2-6) that Christ does not give us new law but he brings us *new faith.*\n\nGalatians 2:18-19 -\n&gt;But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn\u2019t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.\n\nGalatians 3:2-6 -\n&gt;I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh? Have you experienced so much in vain\u2014if it really was in vain? So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? So also Abraham \u201cbelieved God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\u201d\n\nAnd finally there is a metaphysical component insofar as there is nothing in the Bible that says that God states there should be concordance of the mind and the body or that God's creation demands that our minds be in full alignment with what our bodies say. If that were indeed the case, Paul would not have done the incredible work that he did. Numerous times he talks about how weary he is and how he does it because he is a servant of the Lord. \n\nFurthermore, Paul's conversion itself was a violent transformation and dissociation from everything he felt was vital to his being. The difference between Jew and Gentile is huge (especially at the time Paul existed), to the point that Paul himself doubted that God was commanding him to eat the meat of unclean animals (Acts 10:14). To the people at that time, God created Jews and Gentiles as distinctly different entities but he was being challenged to break that mental boundary. \n\nThe bible over and over again shows that identity is a deeply metaphysical thing that is very malleable - so I'm going to disagree with your Genesis-based argument that our physical existence precludes metaphysical grappling over the the flesh that we have been presented with by God."}, {"id": "2r07cv", "body": "I'm not some hippy liberal christian, I'm a serious southern baptist Sunday school teacher. I think that after examining the Bible, there is no argument that being transgender is wrong.

However, if someone really is the opposite gender, then it would by definition not be homosexual.\n\nThe second prong of attack is the rule against cross dressing.

However, this raises the question, \"Can we define gender as biological based on the Bible?\" "}, {"id": "cnbcy8e", "body": "Here are my speculations on the issue.\n\nIf we are created in the image of God, would that not mean God himself has transgender issues? Perhaps he views himself as omnipotent enough to be both. If he is truly our creator that created everything, and did so without a wife would that not make him asexual in a sense, and thus biologically and philosophically capable of both roles? \n\nPerhaps it is his intention for that own internal struggle to be played out in some of us. Do artists not frequently capture their own struggles in their work? Would he not challenge some of us to overcome that hurdle on our life's journey? I think it is within human nature to struggle figuring out who we are, what we stand for, and what our purpose here on earth is. Otherwise would he not provide us with that insight crystal clear from birth? \n\nHe gave us the pieces, but it is our job to figure out what to do with them. He gave us the freedom, even if it exposed us to the chance of sinning. We have free will. We are not his slaves made to do his bidding, but his creations that he loves -- or at least that was always the impression that I have gotten from scriptures. So why wouldn't he want us to find our own paths, even to deviate from what he originally intended, he wants to watch us discover our own selves and paths and get to know us as we do so.\n\nWhy would he make some of us feel wrong, whether we are talking transgender, or other internal struggles that bring about feelings of inadequacy and confusion and self-loath, such as depression even, if he did not want us to be able to overcome that diversity and find happiness. We could take the argument of karma, and that it was a punishment for a past-life or crime, but then that goes against the idea of heaven and hell if we are being punished upon birth for sins we couldn't possibly have committed yet. And what of those individuals who are genuinely born both, and whose gender must be decided upon at birth by their parents? Do they just get some magic we-don't-count pass? \n\nBesides, isn't it often said that God works in mysterious ways?\n\nPersonally my stance on religion is that many of them have been corrupted by man, I think many -- if not most all -- religions and branches of religions have great core values, with an original intent that was pure but over the years -- much like the game telephone -- these messages have been corrupted and changed to fit the needs and values of specific individuals who may have let sins such as greed tarnish their interruption. I think we need to view any interruptions (as well as people) with open minds that don't judge, and open hearts that love without discrimination. That's what feels right.\n\nThe fact you stated the arguments as prongs of attack make it feel wrong to me. Why should we be attacking anyone for how they feel? We should offer support, whether we think they are wrong or right, but attacking them whether verbally, culturally or physically is not going to solve any problems. It feels more morally wrong to me to be the closed-minded person judging what we cannot, without being them or God, possibly ever know. That puts us in a position of know-it-all's, who think we know better than them (potentially even God, assuming we go with the he doesn't make mistakes argument) based on a smaller sampling of facts. After all, we are not gods. we cannot know everything. we we should never pretend to. \n\nFurthermore, and the fact that ultimately makes me accept and believe the word of transgender individuals over anyone else's bias, is that for the great majority of them they feel as they do from early childhood, very early childhood. I've heard of individuals as young as four knowing their sex didn't match their gender. Feeling desperation and fear and loneliness because of it. Even feeling like monsters. Children are innocent, why would God punish them with such feelings that will turn into a life long struggle if they aren't meant to be on that journey? You could claim it is to test them, to challenge them even, but even with that argument it would be pompous to assume you know better if you've never experienced that internal dichotomy personally. \n\nMy final point is this: as a writer I love nothing more than creating characters. I can spend months and months developing one character and all their quirks, but seeing that character come together and take on a life of their own once I finally get around to telling their story, it's the most incredibly powerful feeling. I can't control them anymore. They are their own beings, I can hear their voice in my head when I'm writing their parts, and sometimes they'll even argue with me, challenge my own perspective, and it makes me happier than anything. I love them all the more for it. Because they can surprise me, even though they are my creations and it's gratifying in ways not much else is. I am not yet a parent, but I imagine raising a child brings about similar feelings. I feel like this is -- on a much smaller scale -- what it is like for God. Why else would he have gifted us with that aforementioned free will? \n\ndisclaimer: i am definitely a hippy liberal. so take all of this with a grain of salt. i don't go to church or study the bible religiously. but i do study all religions and cultures and philosophy with an open mind and heart. i believe there is no religion higher than truth.\n"}, {"id": "2r07cv", "body": "I'm not some hippy liberal christian, I'm a serious southern baptist Sunday school teacher.

The scientific explanations for these things aren't on the same plane as the way the writers of scripture would have seen them because they didn't have the ability to see chromosomes or understand hormonal imbalances. \n\n&gt;  Or in other words, it would be condemned as homosexuality, becuase you cannot change the gender that God gave you.

They aren't changing their gender to match their sex, they're changing the physical presentation (sex) to match their mental being (gender). Getting hormone therapy to relieve the gender dysphoria is a HUGE deal - it relieves the mental conflict within these people, alleviates the resulting depression, and makes it less likely that they will commit suicide (also a sin!). It doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be having sex or relationships with the sex they were born into - many of these people maintain their attraction to the opposite sex (and thus become gays/lesbians).

If we conflate that with the OT God's desire to try to keep the Jewish customs and traditions distinct from the gentiles, it makes sense that such a custom would be forbidden.\n\nMy memory's sketchy on that particular verse, but it doesn't equivocate to modern day transpeople or anyone who desires to wear clothes traditionally used for the opposite gender (I've gotten into discussions with many Christians about women wearing trousers, despite trousers originally being a gender neutral invention used for horseback riding over this verse). It's much more likely to fall into the category of a cultural law than a moral law.\n\n\nWhether that has any moral judgement is different entirely. The easiest way I've ever been able to describe being trans to a Christian is by saying that if a baby girl is born with a tumour, do we remove it or not? God's created us in his own image, he knitted us in the womb, and he's given this child a very visible tumour... so do we remove it? Conflated with this is that the tumour will cause drastic hormonal imbalances that will completely alter the muscular structure, bone structure, and hormonal regulation of the little girl. It won't kill her, but most females with this tumour end up dying ~30 years younger because of it, and everyone around her will never be able to treat her the way she'd wish to be treated. Fortunately, it can be fixed with surgery and medication. What do we do?\n\nIt's not a perfect analogy at all, but convincing a transphobic Christian that there's a possibility that a) the Bible doesn't condemn transpeople and b) that an MtF (or vice versa) could be seen as a mentally sound person with a physical problem, rather than a physically sound person with a mental problem, it can sometimes lead to change. \n\n"}, {"id": "2r07cv", "body": "I'm not some hippy liberal christian, I'm a serious southern baptist Sunday school teacher.

However, if someone really is the opposite gender, it's not cross dressing.\n\nThe third prong of attack is against physical mutilation of the body. I think there are other things wrong with this argument. However, that someone is transgender does not imply that they will or have to 'mutilate' their body. They may be happier if they do, but being transgender does not entail it happening.\n\nNone of these imply that being transgender it's self is in any way wrong. It is always something else that commonly goes along with transgender issues that makes it wrong.\n\nEdit: This argument depends upon a non-biological definition of gender.

There are more battles yes, but legal marriage is a huge step towards changing the culture of the society which should fix these issues over time. Change is slow, legislation is slow, but society moves on. By allowing open legal marriages of homosexuals, you're going to see generations raised where married men and women aren't weird. Where a female teacher mentioning their wife or a male mentioning their husband isn't weird. Where gay couples in public aren't weird. Slowly it will become a cultural norm which will push along the legislative referendums needed to fix the other issues you've mentioned. As it is here in America, our laws are changing slowly now so that gays can donate blood if not sexually active for a year. Not perfect, but a huge step from the lifetime ban it once was. I'm sure Ireland will slowly do the same in time.
