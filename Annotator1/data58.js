It is, however, a fact that heavily religious governments throughout history tend to be more violent, and tend to restrict the freedom of their citizens. Currently the countries we have with the highest degree of religious influence are Islamic. In Islamic countries, people are whipped, executed, dismembered, and otherwise cruelly punished for things that ought not to be crimes ON A DAILY BASIS. That is a fact. Are all Muslims bad? No. Are the vast majority of Muslim governments bad? Yes. Are the tolerable ones still way worse than they ought to be? Yes."}, {"id": "cn11cpn", "body": "Did you even read what I wrote?

You point out that religion also does good, implying that this discussion isn't limited to violence. If that's true we must also examine non violent areas in which religion causes people to do other bad things.\n\nI challenge you to name a single country in the world without some instances of personal freedom being restricted due to religion. Behind that law you will find millions of religious people voicing their views. In the Middle East, women are tertiary citizens. In the US, and other countries, people can't marry whom they love. Suicides, depression, alcoholism, abuse. How many people must suffer due to the nonviolent problems with religion before people stop using the tired excuse that it also does good? How many Romes must fall? How many dark ages must we have? How many crusades, wars, lynchings, bushings, and murders?\n\nThe sheer volume of instances in any given day, month, year, or millennia of religion severely impacting people's lives in a negative way makes me sad to see someone make that argument that OP only cited a few instances. Making people feel better about themselves in some marginal, non-quantifiable way isn't enough good to make everything else worth it.

News of the attack took four days to emerge because of a lack of communication.\n\nThese were the big attacks of the last couple of days. Other attacks barely got any attention. People were beheaded in Syria by ISIS. Suicide bombers killed a lot of innocents in Yemen. People died because of attacks in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the cause of all this violence? A lot of people blame it on 'extremists' or 'fundamentalists'. Supposedly, Islam is peaceful and most Muslims are tolerant and liberal and it's just that extremists always do this kind of stuff, regardless of the religion. \n\nYet here in Europe we are taught many times about the atrocities in World War Two. We have to learn that ideology can cause common people to do awful things. \n\nWe don't focus on those who operated the gas chambers. It's not like these people were outliers. We are told how racism and bigotry were common. How the entire Nazi culture and ideology were horrible and caused so much suffering. \n\nYet when it comes to religion in general and Islam in specific, we seem to have forgotten all those lessons. \"People kill because they are crazy, not because of Islam\". \"People are homophobic because they are assholes, not because of religion\".\n\n---\n\nReligious scripture was written centuries ago. It's full of statements that are at odds with modern morality. Islamic scripture encourages killing those who leave Islam, it encourages martyrdom, it encourages fighting unbelievers. \n\nA lot of religious commandments are ignored. But this is the result of lots of campaigns that strive to increase tolerance. It was not a deliberate religious choice. Religious people ignore parts of their scripture, but it has 'evolved this way', it's not a logical choice. \n\n&gt;I'm reading the book \"The Year of Living Biblically,\" by A.J. Acobs.  He tried to follow all of the commandments in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) for one year.  He quickly found that\n\n&gt;* a lot of the rules in the Bible are impossible, illegal, or embarassing to follow nowadays; like wearing tassels, tying your money to yourself, stoning adulterers, not eating fruit from a tree less than 5 years old, and not touching anything that a menstruating woman has touched; and\n\n&gt;* this didn't seem to bother more than a handful of the one-third to one-half of Americans who claim the Bible is the word of God.\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;Religious communities actually protect their members from religion in one sense - **they develop an unspoken consensus on which parts of their religion members can legitimately ignore**.  New converts sometimes try to actually do what their religion tells them to do.\n\n&gt;I remember many times growing up when missionaries described the crazy things their new converts in remote areas did on reading the Bible for the first time - they refused to be taught by female missionaries; they insisted on following Old Testament commandments; they decided that everyone in the village had to confess all of their sins against everyone else in the village; they prayed to God and assumed He would do what they asked; they believed the Christian God would cure their diseases.  **We would always laugh a little at the naivete of these new converts; I could barely hear the tiny voice in my head saying but they're just believing that the Bible means what it says...**\n\n&gt;How do we explain the blindness of people to a religion they grew up with?\n\n&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/\n\nIslamic 'extremists' might break the unspoken consensus on which parts of Islam they can ignore, but it's not like they're deviating more from scripture than other Muslims or modern Christians. \n\nThere were a lot of moderate Nazis. People who thought that Hitler would be less extreme if he got into power, like every other politician who doesn't do what he promised. People who joined the Nazi party because of legal, financial and professional benefits instead of ideological conviction. People who hated the Treaty of Versailles but were tolerant of Jews. Yet all of us realize that Nazism is a dangerous and terrible ideology. If I blame WWII and the Holocaust on 'extremists' who are crazy anyway and do terrible things regardless of ideology, I'm seen as some kind of Neo-Nazi. \n\nBut when I say that religion in general and Islamic in specific causes a lot of problems in today's world, I'm seen as a bigot and an Islamophobe. \n\n**TL;DR:** Religion and ideology can cause 'normal' people to do horrible things. They are real influences, and extremism can be countered by changing ideology and religion. Blaming Islamic terrorism on 'extremists' instead of Islam itself is like blaming the atrocities of WWII on extremists while ignoring the dangers of Nazism. **Change my view!**"}, {"id": "cmzpa1n", "body": "That would only be comparable if there were over 1.5 billion unorganized, disconnected nazis around the world from various cultures and only a tiny tiny miniscule numbers of them were violent towards anyone.

We have to learn that ideology can cause common people to do awful things. \n\nWe don't focus on those who operated the gas chambers. It's not like these people were outliers. We are told how racism and bigotry were common. How the entire Nazi culture and ideology were horrible and caused so much suffering. \n\nYet when it comes to religion in general and Islam in specific, we seem to have forgotten all those lessons. \"People kill because they are crazy, not because of Islam\". \"People are homophobic because they are assholes, not because of religion\".\n\n---\n\nReligious scripture was written centuries ago. It's full of statements that are at odds with modern morality. Islamic scripture encourages killing those who leave Islam, it encourages martyrdom, it encourages fighting unbelievers. \n\nA lot of religious commandments are ignored. But this is the result of lots of campaigns that strive to increase tolerance. It was not a deliberate religious choice. Religious people ignore parts of their scripture, but it has 'evolved this way', it's not a logical choice. \n\n&gt;I'm reading the book \"The Year of Living Biblically,\" by A.J. Acobs.  He tried to follow all of the commandments in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) for one year.  He quickly found that\n\n&gt;* a lot of the rules in the Bible are impossible, illegal, or embarassing to follow nowadays; like wearing tassels, tying your money to yourself, stoning adulterers, not eating fruit from a tree less than 5 years old, and not touching anything that a menstruating woman has touched; and\n\n&gt;* this didn't seem to bother more than a handful of the one-third to one-half of Americans who claim the Bible is the word of God.\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;Religious communities actually protect their members from religion in one sense - **they develop an unspoken consensus on which parts of their religion members can legitimately ignore**.  New converts sometimes try to actually do what their religion tells them to do.\n\n&gt;I remember many times growing up when missionaries described the crazy things their new converts in remote areas did on reading the Bible for the first time - they refused to be taught by female missionaries; they insisted on following Old Testament commandments; they decided that everyone in the village had to confess all of their sins against everyone else in the village; they prayed to God and assumed He would do what they asked; they believed the Christian God would cure their diseases.  **We would always laugh a little at the naivete of these new converts; I could barely hear the tiny voice in my head saying but they're just believing that the Bible means what it says...**\n\n&gt;How do we explain the blindness of people to a religion they grew up with?\n\n&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/\n\nIslamic 'extremists' might break the unspoken consensus on which parts of Islam they can ignore, but it's not like they're deviating more from scripture than other Muslims or modern Christians. \n\nThere were a lot of moderate Nazis. People who thought that Hitler would be less extreme if he got into power, like every other politician who doesn't do what he promised. People who joined the Nazi party because of legal, financial and professional benefits instead of ideological conviction. People who hated the Treaty of Versailles but were tolerant of Jews. Yet all of us realize that Nazism is a dangerous and terrible ideology. If I blame WWII and the Holocaust on 'extremists' who are crazy anyway and do terrible things regardless of ideology, I'm seen as some kind of Neo-Nazi. \n\nBut when I say that religion in general and Islamic in specific causes a lot of problems in today's world, I'm seen as a bigot and an Islamophobe. \n\n**TL;DR:** Religion and ideology can cause 'normal' people to do horrible things. They are real influences, and extremism can be countered by changing ideology and religion. Blaming Islamic terrorism on 'extremists' instead of Islam itself is like blaming the atrocities of WWII on extremists while ignoring the dangers of Nazism. **Change my view!**"}, {"id": "cmznem2", "body": "&gt; What's the cause of all this violence?

Pacifism, at first glance, seems to fit nicely.\n\nHowever, I find it difficult to find an extreme destructive ideology off the top of my head.

And according to Youtube, [there's this video](http://youtu.be/lUw5nLGQEuU).\n\nI would argue that ideologies are inherently benevolent because it's hard to find one that at its core espouses destructive acts as means to an end. I think what's more likely is there are morally neutral ideologies, and then it's people that make destructive choices out of pure self-interest.\n\n------\n\nIf someone can find an ideology that on its face promotes pure murder and destruction, I'd like to see that.

Total chaos and lack of ideology is what stands out. \"Some people just want to see the world burn.\" So maybe apathy is the most destructive and negative position one can take, but I wouldn't call apathy an ideology.\n\n------\n\nDid I change your view? I think I actually support it. But I do think that there is a lot of investigation that could be done to really isolate and understand where an ideology stands in comparison to so-called \"better\" ideologies.

Instead, what they have most strongly in common is that they are para-state actors.  That is to say, they are armed groups acting in areas where there are relatively weak states, and where they exercise some measure of territorial sovereignty without being subject to corresponding accountability functions (vis-a-vis \"their\" citizenry and/or the \"international community\").\n\nSo, the lone hostage-taker in Sydney should be compared less to the rest of the groups in question, and more to other lone actors--like Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber, in the U.S.\n\nOnce we disambiguate lone actors (or small groups) from para-state actors (i.e., collections of people that nominally control territory and administer different sorts of governmental functions in the territory they control, however badly), it becomes possible to analyze the data more effectively.\n\nClearly, individual nutbars do all sorts of bad things all over the place, for all sorts of reasons.  We cannot get a lot of explanatory mileage out of \"religion\" when it comes to understanding lone nutbars and small groups.  Here, public actors (like McVeigh, or like school shooters, or like the Sydney hostage taker) are better lumped in with serial killers, in that they are all individuals--or people acting with the support of only a small group--in socially destructive ways, and doing so for a very wide range of reasons.\n\nThinking about the others, then, the para-state actors, the question is whether their violence is a function of their religion.  I would suggest that this is unlikely, that while their violence certainly cloaks itself in religion (and is no doubt, in many cases, sincerely based on interpretations of religious doctrine), the cause of that violence is finally much more about the primary violence through which states are founded.\n\nAll states are founded in violence.  Para-state actors act violently in their efforts to consolidate control over territory (and/or weaken state control over territory as a first step to developing control over that territory themselves).  There is nothing especially unusual about this.  The fact that it happens with extraordinary consistency throughout human history--irrespective entirely of whether religion is involved or not--strongly suggests that religion is not the causal mechanism that best explains the violence."}, {"id": "2prxlk", "body": "A couple of days ago, dozens of people were held hostage by an Islamic terrorist in Australia.

People who thought that Hitler would be less extreme if he got into power, like every other politician who doesn't do what he promised. People who joined the Nazi party because of legal, financial and professional benefits instead of ideological conviction. People who hated the Treaty of Versailles but were tolerant of Jews.

In fact, much of the success in fighting against these groups is thanks to the actions of regular muslim governments who, much to their chagrin, have them in their country.\n\nNow let's be clear on this: relatively speaking, the percentage of muslims willing to commit violence in the name of their religion, is probably higher than the percentage of Christians willing to do the same (although there is such a thing as [Christian terrorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism).) And obviously, any number above 0 is too high.\n\nBut the point being debated is whether islam can be considered a violent religion.

I think this part of your argument betrays a misunderstanding you may have about difference in religiosity between extremist Muslims and others. The main difference between \"mainstream\" Muslim belief and the stated philosophies of ISIL and other extremists is not which parts of the Quran  they choose to follow. ISIL is instead accused by Islamic leaders of grossly misinterpreting essential pieces of scripture, twisting the words of the prophet to suggest something totally counter to their actual meaning. It's not similar to the reaction of the missionary that you quote. There, the new convert is unaware of the belief priorities established by the local consensus; in this case however, two group are following the same parts of the scripture in completely different directions. Even if you don't accept one interpretation as more valid than another, the fact that you can have such fundamentally different reactions to the same words seems to indicate that the source material of Islam is not the driving factor when it comes to violence. Some other variable is in play.\n\n\nPlease note, I can't find my sources at the moment because I'm on mobile, but I'd like you adopt the assumption they exist and consider if this theory affects your view.

Two hostages died. \n\nEight hours later, [132 children were murdered](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/17/world/asia/pakistan-peshawar-school-attack/) by Islamic terrorists in Pakistan. \n\nYesterday we learned that 32 people were killed and [185 woman and children were kidnapped](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/18/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-kidnapping/) by Islamic terrorists in Nigeria. News of the attack took four days to emerge because of a lack of communication.\n\nThese were the big attacks of the last couple of days. Other attacks barely got any attention. People were beheaded in Syria by ISIS. Suicide bombers killed a lot of innocents in Yemen. People died because of attacks in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the cause of all this violence? A lot of people blame it on 'extremists' or 'fundamentalists'. Supposedly, Islam is peaceful and most Muslims are tolerant and liberal and it's just that extremists always do this kind of stuff, regardless of the religion. \n\nYet here in Europe we are taught many times about the atrocities in World War Two. We have to learn that ideology can cause common people to do awful things. \n\nWe don't focus on those who operated the gas chambers. It's not like these people were outliers. We are told how racism and bigotry were common. How the entire Nazi culture and ideology were horrible and caused so much suffering. \n\nYet when it comes to religion in general and Islam in specific, we seem to have forgotten all those lessons. \"People kill because they are crazy, not because of Islam\". \"People are homophobic because they are assholes, not because of religion\".\n\n---\n\nReligious scripture was written centuries ago. It's full of statements that are at odds with modern morality. Islamic scripture encourages killing those who leave Islam, it encourages martyrdom, it encourages fighting unbelievers. \n\nA lot of religious commandments are ignored. But this is the result of lots of campaigns that strive to increase tolerance. It was not a deliberate religious choice. Religious people ignore parts of their scripture, but it has 'evolved this way', it's not a logical choice. \n\n&gt;I'm reading the book \"The Year of Living Biblically,\" by A.J. Acobs.  He tried to follow all of the commandments in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) for one year.  He quickly found that\n\n&gt;* a lot of the rules in the Bible are impossible, illegal, or embarassing to follow nowadays; like wearing tassels, tying your money to yourself, stoning adulterers, not eating fruit from a tree less than 5 years old, and not touching anything that a menstruating woman has touched; and\n\n&gt;* this didn't seem to bother more than a handful of the one-third to one-half of Americans who claim the Bible is the word of God.\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;Religious communities actually protect their members from religion in one sense - **they develop an unspoken consensus on which parts of their religion members can legitimately ignore**.  New converts sometimes try to actually do what their religion tells them to do.\n\n&gt;I remember many times growing up when missionaries described the crazy things their new converts in remote areas did on reading the Bible for the first time - they refused to be taught by female missionaries; they insisted on following Old Testament commandments; they decided that everyone in the village had to confess all of their sins against everyone else in the village; they prayed to God and assumed He would do what they asked; they believed the Christian God would cure their diseases.  **We would always laugh a little at the naivete of these new converts; I could barely hear the tiny voice in my head saying but they're just believing that the Bible means what it says...**\n\n&gt;How do we explain the blindness of people to a religion they grew up with?\n\n&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/\n\nIslamic 'extremists' might break the unspoken consensus on which parts of Islam they can ignore, but it's not like they're deviating more from scripture than other Muslims or modern Christians. \n\nThere were a lot of moderate Nazis. People who thought that Hitler would be less extreme if he got into power, like every other politician who doesn't do what he promised. People who joined the Nazi party because of legal, financial and professional benefits instead of ideological conviction. People who hated the Treaty of Versailles but were tolerant of Jews. Yet all of us realize that Nazism is a dangerous and terrible ideology. If I blame WWII and the Holocaust on 'extremists' who are crazy anyway and do terrible things regardless of ideology, I'm seen as some kind of Neo-Nazi. \n\nBut when I say that religion in general and Islamic in specific causes a lot of problems in today's world, I'm seen as a bigot and an Islamophobe. \n\n**TL;DR:** Religion and ideology can cause 'normal' people to do horrible things. They are real influences, and extremism can be countered by changing ideology and religion. Blaming Islamic terrorism on 'extremists' instead of Islam itself is like blaming the atrocities of WWII on extremists while ignoring the dangers of Nazism. **Change my view!**"}, {"id": "cmzgxal", "body": "I think there is very little denying that these people who did these terrible terrorist attacks were extremists.

And I think the answer to that is complicated, and probably a bit of both. I doubt many terrorist attacks would have happened without both. \n\nThe religious ideology is part of the problem, certainly, but its often a part of the problem that can't be changed.

Most imperialist power on the planet with global reach. Going to make a shit tonne of enemies.\n\nRussia - The Federation is kept together by military force, not willing participation. There's going to be violence regardless, and the First Chechen War was motivated by nationalism, not religion.\n\nAustralia - A major supporter of America, domestically minorities are treated like shit, going to alienate a lot of people.

It used to be two entirely different countries, it's an authoritarian regime, it's *obviously* going to suffer from political violence.\n\nTurkey - Most of the terrorism in Turkey comes from Communists, not Islamists.\n\nLibya - A totally stable country, dunno why there's any political violence there /s . Libya is suffering a civil war because it's going through a power vacuum. The violence would be occurring regardless of religion.\n\nEgypt - See above. The Sinai Insurgency is occurring because the guy supported by a very, very large amount of the population was kicked out in a military coup. \n\nNigeria - A predominantly Christian country that's forcing a minority population to remain a part of it? I don't see why there'd be any violence there.\n\nIndonesia - A country that's held together by force with *many* clashing cultures and nations.\n\nChina - Oppresses the fuck out of minority populations - for example, the predominantly Muslim province of Xinjiang, is being forced to culturally assimilate with the Han Chinese. Before Radical Islam, it was Soviet-sponsored Communist separatist movements.\n\nThe Iraq War - which has killed over a million people - was launched by George Bush because he claimed God told him it was the right thing to do. Are you now going to claim to me that the Iraq War was entirely apolitical in nature and purely religiously motivated?\n\nNo, because that's dumb as hell. \n\nSimilarly, when people who are Muslims launch attacks, religion is often used as a tool of justification - \"We are an oppressed people, X nation is oppressing us, let's fight back and do so in the name of X belief we all commonly hold\". That's not to say these people don't believe in the religious justification for their cause, but the realty is if you took out religion, these conflicts would still be occurring, as seen by the very long and extensive history of non-religious terrorism.\n\nTaking a Materialist approach to the situation, we can see that without the factors of religion, there would still have been the Iraq insurgency, because America was an aggressive, foreign occupying force. We would've seen that Afghanistan would still have resisted the American invasion, because it was dislodging the local government from power. \n\nThere still would've been some form of 9/11 or other terrorist attack on the US, because America's influence in the Middle East was adversely effecting hundreds of millions of people, most of which did not like it. The fact that Al Qaeda happened to be an Islamist organisation isn't really a factor - they could've been any kind of organisation and still would've been effected negatively by America's actions.\n\nAttributing violence to not just religion, but to *Islam specifically*, as highlighted in your OP, says that you don't really understand the politics of anywhere you've mentioned and you're essentially saying violence occurs \"cus Islam\". \n\nIf I was to be a Nazi, I would have to believe in ultranationalism, racial superiority and racial science, and preservation of the purity of my nation, a strong state government, along with extreme jingoism. If I didn't hold these, I wouldn't be a Nazi. Violence is the *inevitable* conclusion of these beliefs. \n\nContrast that with Islam, in which there are several core tenants you need to believe(eg. The Five Pillars of Islam - Pilgrimage, Charity, Prayer, Monotheism, and Discipline - none of which are violent in nature), but from there I can believe I wide range of things and still be a Muslim, because religious belief is derived from a scripture which is interpreted. Nazism is not. \n\nYour comparison to Nazism really falls short. Not only is the violence committed by a very fringe minority of Muslims, the actions of the Nazi regime were, unsurprisingly, supported by almost all Nazis.\n\nThe ETA, IRA, PKK, and *thousands* of other terror groups which operate with entirely political motivations really give lie to the idea that religion is the driving force for violence by Muslims, because they are *working examples* of terrorism that's entirely politically motivated with no religious *raison d'etre* - That is, it shows people will, without religious cause, find reason to resort to terrorism when they are what they perceive to be an oppressed population. \n\nThe thought process that an *idea* like religious beliefs is the sole cause to drive people to violence is not really grounded in reality. The material basis for violence exists in all of the situations you talk about regardless of religious basis. For example, the divide between Sunni and Shia seen today only became real during the Iran-Iraq War, which had two countries of different religions fighting eachother for very political reasons. \n\nI'm not trying to be a dick here, but you *are* Islamophobic. The problem is that people who so often use terms like bigot and Islamophobe just do so in a drive-by fashion and do not engage you in why precisely what you're saying makes no sense or is wrong, which will only leave you confused and victimised. \n\nFor example, you talk about Islam advocating killing converts, killing unbelievers, martyrdom and so on - I'd challenge you to read the Qur'an and show me each passage where it says that, with full context, and explain to me why it says what you think it says. I don't expect you to, obviously, but it might be a fun exercise for you. \n\nPoint is, most of the information that's quoted as \"Passages from the Qur'an\" is actually totally made up. It's not just done for Muslims, it's done for Christians, too. For example, this quote is often used by people to bash Christianity;\n\n*\"For I have done your bidding, I have slain mine enemies in your name. I have put woman and children to death in your honor, I have caused great pain among them, for your glory.\"* - Psalms, 5:4-10\n\nThis is quite a common quote - what people don't realise is that it literally is not in the book. It's not real. But in the age of the internet, people get information second or third hand and will take it at face value without going through the source material and taking the time to do fact checking themselves. \n\nAs with that quote, many of the quotes about what the Qur'an says are literally non-existent, or are very warped translations intended to make it look as violent as possible. But as with Christianity, there *are* what we would call \"Conservative\" or violent ideas thrown around, and it's up to society and the religion's followers to evolve past those ideas themselves, and be allowed to do so. With all the attacks on Muslim populations by the allegedly progressive West, warlike and Conservative ideas are not going to go away. The material conditions just wont allow for it.\n\nSo, in short... To blame a religion for violence is idealistic at the very least. To force the actions of a fringe minority as a representation of a whole is bigoted, to say the least. And it is not the ideas that exist at the time that dictate how people behave, it's the conditions they're in.

To force the actions of a fringe minority as a representation of a whole is bigoted, to say the least. And it is not the ideas that exist at the time that dictate how people behave, it's the conditions they're in.

Two hostages died. \n\nEight hours later, [132 children were murdered](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/17/world/asia/pakistan-peshawar-school-attack/) by Islamic terrorists in Pakistan. \n\nYesterday we learned that 32 people were killed and [185 woman and children were kidnapped](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/18/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-kidnapping/) by Islamic terrorists in Nigeria. News of the attack took four days to emerge because of a lack of communication.\n\nThese were the big attacks of the last couple of days. Other attacks barely got any attention. People were beheaded in Syria by ISIS. Suicide bombers killed a lot of innocents in Yemen. People died because of attacks in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the cause of all this violence? A lot of people blame it on 'extremists' or 'fundamentalists'. Supposedly, Islam is peaceful and most Muslims are tolerant and liberal and it's just that extremists always do this kind of stuff, regardless of the religion. \n\nYet here in Europe we are taught many times about the atrocities in World War Two. We have to learn that ideology can cause common people to do awful things. \n\nWe don't focus on those who operated the gas chambers. It's not like these people were outliers. We are told how racism and bigotry were common. How the entire Nazi culture and ideology were horrible and caused so much suffering. \n\nYet when it comes to religion in general and Islam in specific, we seem to have forgotten all those lessons. \"People kill because they are crazy, not because of Islam\". \"People are homophobic because they are assholes, not because of religion\".\n\n---\n\nReligious scripture was written centuries ago. It's full of statements that are at odds with modern morality. Islamic scripture encourages killing those who leave Islam, it encourages martyrdom, it encourages fighting unbelievers. \n\nA lot of religious commandments are ignored. But this is the result of lots of campaigns that strive to increase tolerance. It was not a deliberate religious choice. Religious people ignore parts of their scripture, but it has 'evolved this way', it's not a logical choice. \n\n&gt;I'm reading the book \"The Year of Living Biblically,\" by A.J. Acobs.  He tried to follow all of the commandments in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) for one year.  He quickly found that\n\n&gt;* a lot of the rules in the Bible are impossible, illegal, or embarassing to follow nowadays; like wearing tassels, tying your money to yourself, stoning adulterers, not eating fruit from a tree less than 5 years old, and not touching anything that a menstruating woman has touched; and\n\n&gt;* this didn't seem to bother more than a handful of the one-third to one-half of Americans who claim the Bible is the word of God.\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;Religious communities actually protect their members from religion in one sense - **they develop an unspoken consensus on which parts of their religion members can legitimately ignore**.  New converts sometimes try to actually do what their religion tells them to do.\n\n&gt;I remember many times growing up when missionaries described the crazy things their new converts in remote areas did on reading the Bible for the first time - they refused to be taught by female missionaries; they insisted on following Old Testament commandments; they decided that everyone in the village had to confess all of their sins against everyone else in the village; they prayed to God and assumed He would do what they asked; they believed the Christian God would cure their diseases.  **We would always laugh a little at the naivete of these new converts; I could barely hear the tiny voice in my head saying but they're just believing that the Bible means what it says...**\n\n&gt;How do we explain the blindness of people to a religion they grew up with?\n\n&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/\n\nIslamic 'extremists' might break the unspoken consensus on which parts of Islam they can ignore, but it's not like they're deviating more from scripture than other Muslims or modern Christians. \n\nThere were a lot of moderate Nazis. People who thought that Hitler would be less extreme if he got into power, like every other politician who doesn't do what he promised. People who joined the Nazi party because of legal, financial and professional benefits instead of ideological conviction. People who hated the Treaty of Versailles but were tolerant of Jews. Yet all of us realize that Nazism is a dangerous and terrible ideology.

That pedantic argument aside, though, there is a big difference between religion in general and Nazism in particular.\n\nReligion (in general) promotes homogeneity of belief.  Anyone could believe any religion and mostly be in concert with it.  Are there exceptions? Yes, but most religions are entirely about belief and action. Can this potentially cause problems where people feel it is appropriate to force others into their religion or die? Yes, but for the most part modern religions don't behave this way.\n\nNazism specifically espoused racial homogeneity and national primacy.  Those two ideas combined inexorably lead to aggression against other racial groups.  Race isn't a choice, you can't change it and Nazism is explicitly not tolerant of non-Germanic races.
