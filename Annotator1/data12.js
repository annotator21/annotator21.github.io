League of Legends general is a place where we can't go six posts without arguing with eachother about which waifus are shit or which tripfag deserves to be decapitated or how much we want to stick a fork in eachothers eyes for building the wrong item on the wrong character. But when I get into Skype with these people to play games with them, they're totally normal. They're just regular people who blow off steam by calling other people cuckolds on 4chan. If anything, I'd say that 4chan's environment is pretty healthy. There's something to be said about a place where you can go to blow off steam and say basically whatever you want without consequence. If you go into the experience thinking \"I wanna fit in with everyone else here on 4chan and be angry and upset all the time!\", then yeah, your life will change for the worse.

It was used most importantly(to the story) on the oldest, most central tree. The first tree. The tree that provided the seeds which eventually became the entire rest of the [4]chard.\n\nThis tree, and those similarly doused with pesticide, began to produce rotten [apple]s each harvest. It began with only a small number of [apple]s per harvest, and the rot seemed to be exclusive to those trees. In a short time however, it was evident that not only had the poison began to spread via the old trees' central root systems to the rest of the ever-expanding [4]chard, but that the pesticide was ultimately ineffective at eradicating it's intended target. Ironically the pest would prove to be *so* persistent that it eventually developed a taste for the fruit of the poisoned trees in particular. So while ever-present throughout the rest of the [4]chard, the insignificant pest that was deemed capitally offensive to the young garden in it's infancy eventually took up primary residence in the very trees that drastic measures had been taken to protect. \n\nOver time, while the [4]chard continued to grow in the number of trees and overall quantity of [apple]s produced, each harvest produced more and more rotten fruit and less and less quality, refreshingly unique [apple]s. A symptom of the original poisoning invading the root system of the entire [4]chard, it wasn't long before trees throughout, even those planted years later, would begin to exhibit signs of the same ills. \n\nToday the [4]chard has massively increased in the number of trees on the plot, but the the overall quality of the fruit has experienced a noticeable and rapid decline over the years, with the discovery of truly fantastic and deserving [apple]s becoming more infrequent overall. The trees that were originally exposed to the toxicity are mere husks, crawling with parasites and very rarely producing fruit worth eating. They can't be cut down now for the same reason they were praised and admired long ago. They're integral to the root system of the entire [4]chard, and representative of the great and original idea that was the foundation for the [4]chard itself. \n\n\nIf you've the time and patience to sort through all of the semi-fermented garbage hanging about and don't mind trying to ignore all of the annoying insects who've invaded the place, a brilliantly creative or otherwise distinguished specimen of an [apple] can still be gleaned from this hopeful collective that once seemed to have limitless potential.

Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups.\n\nOn boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof.

On reddit you usually will only see the few opinions the hivemind agrees with (sort of like how this post will likely get buried.)\n\nIn this sense I believe reddit is a lot more of a normalizing force than 4chan. In addition, since you are linked to an identity on reddit, you are much more concerned with actually constructing an identity and being something, whereas on 4chan the potential to reinvent yourself and your view is infinite. \n\nI don't think browsing 4chan actively makes you into a worse (or better) person, in fact I don't necessarily believe it changes you at all unless you are an impressionable kid, in which case all websites have the potential to change you. So applying your last argument, there is an equal amount of terrible stuff on reddit, but it's actually a lot more subtly terrible than 4chan, where it's often fairly blatant that people are trolling. So if you are impressionable, you are probably a lot less aware of how reddit is changing you for the worse.\n\nIn many ways I think 4chan is like the condensed form of what makes the internet in general a bad place, but so much so that it becomes obvious, and if you are self-aware at all, allows you to spot where the rest of the internet is actually absurd. \n\nStill, I'm drawing largely from my own experiences and I guess the effect really just depends on the individual person.

Just like you have your anecdotal experience, these people have developed theirs.  \n  \nAlso, you and others continue to ignore the actual issue at hand, which is the fact that them having an outlet to express these ideologies does not make them bad people. It would be the fact that they have the ideologies in the first place. An outlet of free speech is not to blame for the speech given. It's like blaming the soap company that made the box the town crier stands on.  \n  \nI will not continue to address the issue on ideology, as it is irrelevant to the CMV topic"}, {"id": "cnev6ws", "body": "Honestly, read the abstract of the paper I linked in the edit.

Nonetheless, I proceed.  \n  \nSo the issue you see is valid, the constant use of the words without context or the ideas without regard for the serious nature could lead to society reaccepting the ideologies we jest about.  \n  \nHowever, I do not see this as something society as a whole could face. This is definitely a large forum, and same with 4chan, but it is not large enough for that sort of social change. With the internet allowing free speech in the simplest manner possible, not only does society not really acknowledge the general views of this website, but other websites and forums challenge us as well. While Reddit is the \"front page of the internet\", not everyone is subscribed to that metaphorical newspaper.  \n  \nBut this all look so much further out than it needs to. Reddit itself challenges normalization of idea. With so many subreddits, different topics, each with the capability for any individual to post anything, you can never take away each individual voice. Others can drown them out for sure, but no idea is safe for some degree of scrutiny. Hell, look where we're posting right now: a forum dedicated to opposing different ideologies, ranging all over the spectrum.  \n  \nThe threat normalization has is to the individuals who are already susceptible to outside influence. People who seek the validation of thoughts they already have lingering in their heads. People who think that going against the grain is why they have so many issues, and allowing them to allocate blame for those issues to others. I'm talking people who think others aren't accepting of them because they believe in an extreme ideology.   \n  \nYes, the internet can help this happen. Reddit, 4chan, and any site that allows radical speech can trigger people to think these views are okay, and that they can actually act upon them in real life. But it isn't a regular thing. These people are the extreme minority who likely already have issues.  \n  \nThe CMV states that frequent use of 4chan will make you a worse person. This is a blanket statement, and in no way specifies certain people. To suggest that any randy that goes onto 4chan often subscribes to ideologies that are extreme, hateful, and/or bad, is and outrageous generalization. Even if we just talk about /b/, the biggest cesspool on the internet, it's still full of angsty teen who are just trying to be edgy. (I speak from my own anecdotal experience on this one.)  \n  \nSo can forums trigger hate? Yes. This is an unfortunate side effect to free speech. Does frequenting a forum on fitness, fashion, anime, technology, weapons, My Little Pony, or general randomness make you hateful? No. Does even frequenting a politically incorrect board, which is full of people who actually subscribe to hateful ideologies, make you hateful? No, it makes you someone who reads people's hateful ideologies. In the common man, it is your choice where or not you subscribe to a view, and if you see the evidence as fit to change your view, it is not at the hand of the forum, but rather your own critical thinking skills that makes you decide this.  \n  \nEdit: sorry if I gave you a dozen mail notifications, my phone sent this same post several times"}, {"id": "cnemrnz", "body": "While that is fair, it is also making the contention that having certain ideologies inherently make you a worse person.

Here's an anecdote:\n\nI have a friend who started browsing 4chan not longer after high school. We graduated in 2010.  He didn't go to college or have any plans at all really even though he is a fairly smart, capable person. He was working at a dealership as a mechanic however. \n\nSo my friend was into cars and guns and working on mechanical things already. Over the past several years he's been in and out of jobs and has had plenty of long stretches of nothing to do except peruse 4chan and watch Netflix. \n\nAbout 2012 he told me that feminism was ruining America. Now, if you disagree with feminism, that's one thing, but he was arguing that everything wrong with the country is caused by feminism. That's a pretty absurd statement. While he didn't explicitly tell me that 4chan influenced this view, and I wouldn't expect him to admit it even if I'd asked, I know the attitude on 4chan toward feminism. \n\nAround that same time, he started REALLY getting into guns.  He has ventured away from /b/ and stays mainly on /k/ now. About 2013 he started ranting about gun rights a lot.  About a month ago, he literally stated that he is a one issue voter for gun rights.

If someone then jokes about rape, and everyone laughs, that reinforces this idea.\n\nI'm a bit ambivalent about that, actually, since I think it's usually a bad idea to make something so taboo that we won't even joke about it.\n\nBut it certainly seems plausible -- it is very common for someone to see the world as just as bad as they are, because then they feel better about themselves.

When you browse /sci/, /lit/, /ck/, /out/, any of the interest boards, you can learn to look past the shitposting and occasionally learn something new about yourself or the world around you. The fact that these connections are rare and fleeting only make them better in my eyes. If someone actually browses /fit/ and uses it to motivate themselves into physical fitness, I'm not sure that person is \"worse\" for finding that on 4chan.\n\nIn your argument you assume that the way people behave on 4chan is the same as the way people act in a face to face conversation. This is just not the case. There is a set of (quite ridiculous) vernacular for the site and I would never call one of my gay friends a gayfag or tell stories in sentence fragments. This might lower the overall discourse, though it doesn't imbue individually good posts with corruption.\n\n4chan is less of an echo chamber than most websites. Websites are mostly very specialized and when you combine that with confirmation bias, most people only see the parts of the internet they like. Even on websites like reddit that are internet aggregators people filter what they see based on their interests. The \"graffiti wall\" effect an earlier poster mentioned creates a more eclectic space and I would postulate that you are more likely to find someone that disagrees with you than on reddit (where rehashing old ideas gets your post upvotes) or the fox news comment section (a very homogenous readership). \n\nThird, your claim that it will make you a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person isn't based on something I can agree with. Has one of your friends been browsing 4chan more and now further exemplifies those traits? Maybe the depression leads a person to browse 4chan more and not the other way around as you suggest.

There are, however, areas in which the 4chan view represents an inconvenient truth; things which most of us are aware of the validity of, but which you are not normally permitted to say out loud.\n\nHow will 4chan damage you?\n\n*  Misogyny.\n\nI can't remember the last post I read on 4chan, anywhere, which contained any form of positive statement about women.  Women are hated on 4chan more than virtually any other form of life.  Someone who is cruel to a cat might well end up dead if 4chan gets wind of it, but if you abuse women, in any manner conceivable, you are considered a hero.\n\nI truthfully have very mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, I know of a couple of women offline who are decent people; but on the other, at 38 I've had a single sexual partner, and I'm as celibate as the majority of other men in my generation.  The major objection I have with feminism, is that I know that their objective is not even a society where women are dominant.  Feminists want a society where men literally no longer ***exist.***\n\nIf you are a man who advocates feminism, then I would encourage you to read [this](http://www.womynkind.org/scum.htm), and to recognise that any feminist who tries to claim that it is not representative of feminism, is lying to you.  That document is the very heart and soul of feminism; it is how they truly think and feel about men.  When I was on IRC in the mid 90s, on a few occasions I went into channels that were run by lesbians.  The level of hatred that I saw towards men there has remained with me for the rest of my life.  It was worse than what I've seen on 4chan; worse than anything I've ever seen anywhere else, other than maybe some of the descriptions I've read of war attrocities.\n\nI do not morally condone the attitude which most men on 4chan have towards women; but again, it's complicated.  Offline, I'm currently living at a backpacker hostel, and during the busy season we have beautiful, young (late teens through to 30 or so) women showing up here on a moderately regular basis.  There are virtually no men here who I can not make friends with, yet many of these women will refuse to even make eye contact with you if you try to speak to them; and there are times when I am speaking to them, when I can clearly tell that they are only putting up with me for the sake of politeness.\n\nAny discussion or even mention of feminism, should also acknowledge the degree to which the movement is infused with (I won't say influenced by, because that is not a strong enough term) the Frankfurt School and radical Marxism.  To a large extent, this also means that feminists are pawns, in the sense that a lot of early Marxist-related ideology was developed by the Russians, who at the time were openly seeking to destroy Western society.  Feminism is also, therefore, inherently destructive.  The movement is a sociological (and especially biological/reproductive) wrecking ball, and that is by deliberate, purposeful design.\n \nSo there are valid arguments here to be made on both sides.  I don't necessarily believe that women in other ages or societies have been inherently bad people, but the most cruel and vindictive human beings that I've known in life, have generally been Millennial women.  To the extent that I am able to befriend women, it will almost always be women over the age of 35.\n\n*  Homosexual evangelism.\n\nThere is an extremely strong gay presence on 4chan, and it isn't exclusively limited to /lgbt/.  My main area of concern here, is a type of pornography called sissy hypno porn.  If you don't know what sissy hypno porn is, it's  loaded with subliminal messaging, which is designed to hypnotically/subconsciously feminise men and cause them to become compulsively addicted to fellatio, via Pavlovian conditioning.\n\nThis is another form of inconvenient truth.  It is generally not permissible to express the idea that homosexual evangelism, or any kind of \"gay agenda,\" actually exists; yet the reality of sissy hypno porn, what I've read about its' effects, and the casual attitudes I've also seen expressed by some who exploit and abuse people who have been exposed to this form of mind control, tells me that it is very, very real.\n\n*  Racism.\n\nThere is a lot of racism expressed on 4chan.  Most of it is anti-black.  While I believe that the Stormfront/white supremacist presence on the site is real, it is generally much smaller than most people think.  Most of the racist material on 4chan is expressed by nihilistic trolls who primarily want to offend people, and who know that racism is one of the most reliable ways to do so.\n\nMy own perspective on race, is not as politically correct as the Reddit standard view, but is also not as harsh as that usually expressed on 4chan.  I've truthfully always been an advocate of ***voluntary*** segregation, and the idea that there never would have been a black/white problem in America, if American whites had not kidnapped blacks from the African continent in the first place.  I feel more or less the same way about the Boer/Afrikaans presence in Africa as well.  Whites simply should not be there, as blacks should not be in America.  If the two groups were not forcing each other to cohabit, there would not be a problem.\n\nI also do not believe that a lower median score on IQ tests, says anything about the inherent, general worth of a given ethnic group.  It ***is*** true, as far as I'm concerned, that IQ testing carries a cultural bias; it measures performance against the types of mental activities which are customary for whites.  You don't see whites being formally tested on hunting or other indigenous skills, and I'm guessing that if we were, a lot of us would do just as poorly as blacks are often claimed to on IQ tests.\n\nI am not a champion or advocate of contemporary Anglo/American society.  I think it is probably the single most degenerate civilisation that has ever existed on this planet, to the point where it seriously carries the potential for causing human extinction.  Yet at the same time, the levels of rage and vindictiveness that I have seen expressed online by Native Americans in particular, has told me that the indigenous model is nowhere near perfect either.  I don't know what the solution is for us at the moment; but I don't think that any particular racial or cultural group can truly claim to have it.\n\n*  Fascism.\n\nYou will be heavily exposed to fascist ideas and propaganda on 4chan, as well as sympathetic revisionism on the subjects of Adolf Hitler and the German Nazi party.\n\nMy perspective is that fascism is an inherently bogus (provably false) ideology.  Said ideology is based on two points; the Zero-Sum Game, and the supposed necessity of war as a catalyst for human development.  I believe that contemporary automation technology has to at least a certain degree rendered scarcity as a concept irrelevant.

There are, however, areas in which the 4chan view represents an inconvenient truth; things which most of us are aware of the validity of, but which you are not normally permitted to say out loud.\n\nHow will 4chan damage you?\n\n*  Misogyny.\n\nI can't remember the last post I read on 4chan, anywhere, which contained any form of positive statement about women.  Women are hated on 4chan more than virtually any other form of life.  Someone who is cruel to a cat might well end up dead if 4chan gets wind of it, but if you abuse women, in any manner conceivable, you are considered a hero.\n\nI truthfully have very mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, I know of a couple of women offline who are decent people; but on the other, at 38 I've had a single sexual partner, and I'm as celibate as the majority of other men in my generation.  The major objection I have with feminism, is that I know that their objective is not even a society where women are dominant.  Feminists want a society where men literally no longer ***exist.***\n\nIf you are a man who advocates feminism, then I would encourage you to read [this](http://www.womynkind.org/scum.htm), and to recognise that any feminist who tries to claim that it is not representative of feminism, is lying to you.  That document is the very heart and soul of feminism; it is how they truly think and feel about men.  When I was on IRC in the mid 90s, on a few occasions I went into channels that were run by lesbians.  The level of hatred that I saw towards men there has remained with me for the rest of my life.  It was worse than what I've seen on 4chan; worse than anything I've ever seen anywhere else, other than maybe some of the descriptions I've read of war attrocities.\n\nI do not morally condone the attitude which most men on 4chan have towards women; but again, it's complicated.  Offline, I'm currently living at a backpacker hostel, and during the busy season we have beautiful, young (late teens through to 30 or so) women showing up here on a moderately regular basis.  There are virtually no men here who I can not make friends with, yet many of these women will refuse to even make eye contact with you if you try to speak to them; and there are times when I am speaking to them, when I can clearly tell that they are only putting up with me for the sake of politeness.\n\nAny discussion or even mention of feminism, should also acknowledge the degree to which the movement is infused with (I won't say influenced by, because that is not a strong enough term) the Frankfurt School and radical Marxism.  To a large extent, this also means that feminists are pawns, in the sense that a lot of early Marxist-related ideology was developed by the Russians, who at the time were openly seeking to destroy Western society.  Feminism is also, therefore, inherently destructive.  The movement is a sociological (and especially biological/reproductive) wrecking ball, and that is by deliberate, purposeful design.\n \nSo there are valid arguments here to be made on both sides.  I don't necessarily believe that women in other ages or societies have been inherently bad people, but the most cruel and vindictive human beings that I've known in life, have generally been Millennial women.  To the extent that I am able to befriend women, it will almost always be women over the age of 35.\n\n*  Homosexual evangelism.\n\nThere is an extremely strong gay presence on 4chan, and it isn't exclusively limited to /lgbt/.  My main area of concern here, is a type of pornography called sissy hypno porn.  If you don't know what sissy hypno porn is, it's  loaded with subliminal messaging, which is designed to hypnotically/subconsciously feminise men and cause them to become compulsively addicted to fellatio, via Pavlovian conditioning.\n\nThis is another form of inconvenient truth.  It is generally not permissible to express the idea that homosexual evangelism, or any kind of \"gay agenda,\" actually exists; yet the reality of sissy hypno porn, what I've read about its' effects, and the casual attitudes I've also seen expressed by some who exploit and abuse people who have been exposed to this form of mind control, tells me that it is very, very real.\n\n*  Racism.\n\nThere is a lot of racism expressed on 4chan.  Most of it is anti-black.  While I believe that the Stormfront/white supremacist presence on the site is real, it is generally much smaller than most people think.  Most of the racist material on 4chan is expressed by nihilistic trolls who primarily want to offend people, and who know that racism is one of the most reliable ways to do so.\n\nMy own perspective on race, is not as politically correct as the Reddit standard view, but is also not as harsh as that usually expressed on 4chan.  I've truthfully always been an advocate of ***voluntary*** segregation, and the idea that there never would have been a black/white problem in America, if American whites had not kidnapped blacks from the African continent in the first place.  I feel more or less the same way about the Boer/Afrikaans presence in Africa as well.  Whites simply should not be there, as blacks should not be in America.  If the two groups were not forcing each other to cohabit, there would not be a problem.\n\nI also do not believe that a lower median score on IQ tests, says anything about the inherent, general worth of a given ethnic group.  It ***is*** true, as far as I'm concerned, that IQ testing carries a cultural bias; it measures performance against the types of mental activities which are customary for whites.  You don't see whites being formally tested on hunting or other indigenous skills, and I'm guessing that if we were, a lot of us would do just as poorly as blacks are often claimed to on IQ tests.\n\nI am not a champion or advocate of contemporary Anglo/American society.  I think it is probably the single most degenerate civilisation that has ever existed on this planet, to the point where it seriously carries the potential for causing human extinction.  Yet at the same time, the levels of rage and vindictiveness that I have seen expressed online by Native Americans in particular, has told me that the indigenous model is nowhere near perfect either.  I don't know what the solution is for us at the moment; but I don't think that any particular racial or cultural group can truly claim to have it.\n\n*  Fascism.\n\nYou will be heavily exposed to fascist ideas and propaganda on 4chan, as well as sympathetic revisionism on the subjects of Adolf Hitler and the German Nazi party.\n\nMy perspective is that fascism is an inherently bogus (provably false) ideology.  Said ideology is based on two points; the Zero-Sum Game, and the supposed necessity of war as a catalyst for human development.  I believe that contemporary automation technology has to at least a certain degree rendered scarcity as a concept irrelevant.  I also believe that the falsity of the idea that modern war is in any way beneficial or desirable, should be entirely self-evident to any genuinely sane or lucid human being.  Unfortunately for most fascists I've known online, sane and lucid are not words that I can use to describe them.\n\n*  The Jewish Conspiracy.\n\nThe mythical, central, all-controlling Zionist conspiracy, is another one of those ideas which is simply unthinkable on Reddit.

A symptom of a porn addiction... that's much more likely. \n\nHow many guys started off at 11 or 12 plugging \"boobs\" into google? That's what I did when I was a kid. But at 22... that doesn't really \"work\" for me anymore. There is a tendency in porn use to progress from the \"softer,\" more \"innocent\" stuff to the \"hard,\" more \"extreme\" stuff.   \n\nNow, that doesn't mean every (straight) guy goes from \"bikini pics\" to \"lesbian\" to \"amateur teen porn\" to \"hardcore\" to \"bukkake\" to \"rape\" to \"feminization\" to \"gay porn\" in that order. Some guys don't ever progress from lesbian stuff. Some guys are content watching just one video to get off. But other guys... start to need a bit more novelty. They need a stronger hit.  \n\n\"Hot Teen Solo\" videos just don't give guys that *rush* they're used to. So they search for something that does. For some guys, that's bukkake, rape, tentacles, gay porn, etc. That doesn't mean the individual *wants or intends* to be a rapist. That doesn't mean the individual is secretly a homosexual.

There are, however, areas in which the 4chan view represents an inconvenient truth; things which most of us are aware of the validity of, but which you are not normally permitted to say out loud.\n\nHow will 4chan damage you?\n\n*  Misogyny.\n\nI can't remember the last post I read on 4chan, anywhere, which contained any form of positive statement about women.  Women are hated on 4chan more than virtually any other form of life.  Someone who is cruel to a cat might well end up dead if 4chan gets wind of it, but if you abuse women, in any manner conceivable, you are considered a hero.\n\nI truthfully have very mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, I know of a couple of women offline who are decent people; but on the other, at 38 I've had a single sexual partner, and I'm as celibate as the majority of other men in my generation.  The major objection I have with feminism, is that I know that their objective is not even a society where women are dominant.  Feminists want a society where men literally no longer ***exist.***\n\nIf you are a man who advocates feminism, then I would encourage you to read [this](http://www.womynkind.org/scum.htm), and to recognise that any feminist who tries to claim that it is not representative of feminism, is lying to you.  That document is the very heart and soul of feminism; it is how they truly think and feel about men.  When I was on IRC in the mid 90s, on a few occasions I went into channels that were run by lesbians.  The level of hatred that I saw towards men there has remained with me for the rest of my life.  It was worse than what I've seen on 4chan; worse than anything I've ever seen anywhere else, other than maybe some of the descriptions I've read of war attrocities.\n\nI do not morally condone the attitude which most men on 4chan have towards women; but again, it's complicated.  Offline, I'm currently living at a backpacker hostel, and during the busy season we have beautiful, young (late teens through to 30 or so) women showing up here on a moderately regular basis.  There are virtually no men here who I can not make friends with, yet many of these women will refuse to even make eye contact with you if you try to speak to them; and there are times when I am speaking to them, when I can clearly tell that they are only putting up with me for the sake of politeness.\n\nAny discussion or even mention of feminism, should also acknowledge the degree to which the movement is infused with (I won't say influenced by, because that is not a strong enough term) the Frankfurt School and radical Marxism.  To a large extent, this also means that feminists are pawns, in the sense that a lot of early Marxist-related ideology was developed by the Russians, who at the time were openly seeking to destroy Western society.  Feminism is also, therefore, inherently destructive.  The movement is a sociological (and especially biological/reproductive) wrecking ball, and that is by deliberate, purposeful design.\n \nSo there are valid arguments here to be made on both sides.  I don't necessarily believe that women in other ages or societies have been inherently bad people, but the most cruel and vindictive human beings that I've known in life, have generally been Millennial women.  To the extent that I am able to befriend women, it will almost always be women over the age of 35.\n\n*  Homosexual evangelism.\n\nThere is an extremely strong gay presence on 4chan, and it isn't exclusively limited to /lgbt/.  My main area of concern here, is a type of pornography called sissy hypno porn.  If you don't know what sissy hypno porn is, it's  loaded with subliminal messaging, which is designed to hypnotically/subconsciously feminise men and cause them to become compulsively addicted to fellatio, via Pavlovian conditioning.\n\nThis is another form of inconvenient truth.  It is generally not permissible to express the idea that homosexual evangelism, or any kind of \"gay agenda,\" actually exists; yet the reality of sissy hypno porn, what I've read about its' effects, and the casual attitudes I've also seen expressed by some who exploit and abuse people who have been exposed to this form of mind control, tells me that it is very, very real.\n\n*  Racism.\n\nThere is a lot of racism expressed on 4chan.  Most of it is anti-black.  While I believe that the Stormfront/white supremacist presence on the site is real, it is generally much smaller than most people think.  Most of the racist material on 4chan is expressed by nihilistic trolls who primarily want to offend people, and who know that racism is one of the most reliable ways to do so.\n\nMy own perspective on race, is not as politically correct as the Reddit standard view, but is also not as harsh as that usually expressed on 4chan.  I've truthfully always been an advocate of ***voluntary*** segregation, and the idea that there never would have been a black/white problem in America, if American whites had not kidnapped blacks from the African continent in the first place.  I feel more or less the same way about the Boer/Afrikaans presence in Africa as well.  Whites simply should not be there, as blacks should not be in America.  If the two groups were not forcing each other to cohabit, there would not be a problem.\n\nI also do not believe that a lower median score on IQ tests, says anything about the inherent, general worth of a given ethnic group.  It ***is*** true, as far as I'm concerned, that IQ testing carries a cultural bias; it measures performance against the types of mental activities which are customary for whites.  You don't see whites being formally tested on hunting or other indigenous skills, and I'm guessing that if we were, a lot of us would do just as poorly as blacks are often claimed to on IQ tests.\n\nI am not a champion or advocate of contemporary Anglo/American society.  I think it is probably the single most degenerate civilisation that has ever existed on this planet, to the point where it seriously carries the potential for causing human extinction.  Yet at the same time, the levels of rage and vindictiveness that I have seen expressed online by Native Americans in particular, has told me that the indigenous model is nowhere near perfect either.  I don't know what the solution is for us at the moment; but I don't think that any particular racial or cultural group can truly claim to have it.\n\n*  Fascism.\n\nYou will be heavily exposed to fascist ideas and propaganda on 4chan, as well as sympathetic revisionism on the subjects of Adolf Hitler and the German Nazi party.\n\nMy perspective is that fascism is an inherently bogus (provably false) ideology.  Said ideology is based on two points; the Zero-Sum Game, and the supposed necessity of war as a catalyst for human development.  I believe that contemporary automation technology has to at least a certain degree rendered scarcity as a concept irrelevant.  I also believe that the falsity of the idea that modern war is in any way beneficial or desirable, should be entirely self-evident to any genuinely sane or lucid human being.  Unfortunately for most fascists I've known online, sane and lucid are not words that I can use to describe them.\n\n*  The Jewish Conspiracy.\n\nThe mythical, central, all-controlling Zionist conspiracy, is another one of those ideas which is simply unthinkable on Reddit.  You aren't merely forbidden from expressing it; holding it mentally is likely considered a literal thoughtcrime by most here.  It would supposedly take us back to the Holocaust if we were to seriously entertain it.\n\nThe problem with rejecting it, however, is the fact that there is such abundant evidence for it.

The modern definition of feminism, as your average modern 20-something-year-old will gather from wikipedia, is no different from egalitarianism. The modern definition, on the surface, claims to be about equality across both genders.\n\nI could write at length about the undesirability and danger, of expecting Wikipedia to serve as a truly accurate, objective source of information; but that is an entirely different subject.\n\nThe point is that the egalitarian argument is used by feminism as a form of cover; a means of protecting itself.  It's very similar to the method that Freemasonry uses to protect itself from negative public opinion.\n\nMasonry is an organisation with a very regimented form of hierarchical structure; the degree system.  This protects the organisation, because it has a large number of individuals at the lower levels, who are not only genuinely benevolent, but do not have the necessary power or authority to be otherwise.  So while one person can express the opinion that Masonry is a Luciferian conspiracy, twenty other people might voice objections that their kind, elderly grandfather was a Mason, and that the Masons are therefore nothing more than a group of harmless old men, based on their own personal experience.  In reality however, the Luciferian conspiracy genuinely does exist; it simply does so at the higher levels of the organisation.\n\nThe same is true with feminism.  The majority of self-styled \"feminists,\" who you will come across on the Internet are reasonable, politicially centric, sane individuals who are genuinely interested in nothing more than gender equality.  What the rank and file believe in, however, says absolutely nothing about what the movement's original founders and core members believe; those active individuals who are primarily responsible for the movement's continued existence.  It is this proverbial inner circle who write things like the SCUM Manifesto and who want a single-gender society; they simply rely on the rank and file to make excuses for them when the mainstream public are justifiably disturbed by their toxicity and extremism.\n\nSo when I talk about feminism, I am not interested in what the average Redditor who is trying to be politically correct and hip, and who calls him or herself a feminist in order to do so, thinks.  I'm a lot more interested in people like Lierre Keith, Valarie Solanas, and Germaine Greer; because they are the ones who are writing the sick material which impressionable and (largely) innocent women read, and have their minds contaminated with.  If we liken feminism with a tree, it is important to understand that the roots are where the problem really lies; not the leaves or branches."}, {"id": "cne7veg", "body": "There are numerous ways in which 4chan will damage your perspective.  There are, however, areas in which the 4chan view represents an inconvenient truth; things which most of us are aware of the validity of, but which you are not normally permitted to say out loud.\n\nHow will 4chan damage you?\n\n*  Misogyny.\n\nI can't remember the last post I read on 4chan, anywhere, which contained any form of positive statement about women.  Women are hated on 4chan more than virtually any other form of life.  Someone who is cruel to a cat might well end up dead if 4chan gets wind of it, but if you abuse women, in any manner conceivable, you are considered a hero.\n\nI truthfully have very mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, I know of a couple of women offline who are decent people; but on the other, at 38 I've had a single sexual partner, and I'm as celibate as the majority of other men in my generation.  The major objection I have with feminism, is that I know that their objective is not even a society where women are dominant.  Feminists want a society where men literally no longer ***exist.***\n\nIf you are a man who advocates feminism, then I would encourage you to read [this](http://www.womynkind.org/scum.htm), and to recognise that any feminist who tries to claim that it is not representative of feminism, is lying to you.  That document is the very heart and soul of feminism; it is how they truly think and feel about men.  When I was on IRC in the mid 90s, on a few occasions I went into channels that were run by lesbians.  The level of hatred that I saw towards men there has remained with me for the rest of my life.  It was worse than what I've seen on 4chan; worse than anything I've ever seen anywhere else, other than maybe some of the descriptions I've read of war attrocities.\n\nI do not morally condone the attitude which most men on 4chan have towards women; but again, it's complicated.  Offline, I'm currently living at a backpacker hostel, and during the busy season we have beautiful, young (late teens through to 30 or so) women showing up here on a moderately regular basis.  There are virtually no men here who I can not make friends with, yet many of these women will refuse to even make eye contact with you if you try to speak to them; and there are times when I am speaking to them, when I can clearly tell that they are only putting up with me for the sake of politeness.\n\nAny discussion or even mention of feminism, should also acknowledge the degree to which the movement is infused with (I won't say influenced by, because that is not a strong enough term) the Frankfurt School and radical Marxism.  To a large extent, this also means that feminists are pawns, in the sense that a lot of early Marxist-related ideology was developed by the Russians, who at the time were openly seeking to destroy Western society.  Feminism is also, therefore, inherently destructive.  The movement is a sociological (and especially biological/reproductive) wrecking ball, and that is by deliberate, purposeful design.\n \nSo there are valid arguments here to be made on both sides.  I don't necessarily believe that women in other ages or societies have been inherently bad people, but the most cruel and vindictive human beings that I've known in life, have generally been Millennial women.  To the extent that I am able to befriend women, it will almost always be women over the age of 35.\n\n*  Homosexual evangelism.\n\nThere is an extremely strong gay presence on 4chan, and it isn't exclusively limited to /lgbt/.  My main area of concern here, is a type of pornography called sissy hypno porn.  If you don't know what sissy hypno porn is, it's  loaded with subliminal messaging, which is designed to hypnotically/subconsciously feminise men and cause them to become compulsively addicted to fellatio, via Pavlovian conditioning.\n\nThis is another form of inconvenient truth.  It is generally not permissible to express the idea that homosexual evangelism, or any kind of \"gay agenda,\" actually exists; yet the reality of sissy hypno porn, what I've read about its' effects, and the casual attitudes I've also seen expressed by some who exploit and abuse people who have been exposed to this form of mind control, tells me that it is very, very real.\n\n*  Racism.\n\nThere is a lot of racism expressed on 4chan.  Most of it is anti-black.  While I believe that the Stormfront/white supremacist presence on the site is real, it is generally much smaller than most people think.  Most of the racist material on 4chan is expressed by nihilistic trolls who primarily want to offend people, and who know that racism is one of the most reliable ways to do so.\n\nMy own perspective on race, is not as politically correct as the Reddit standard view, but is also not as harsh as that usually expressed on 4chan.  I've truthfully always been an advocate of ***voluntary*** segregation, and the idea that there never would have been a black/white problem in America, if American whites had not kidnapped blacks from the African continent in the first place.  I feel more or less the same way about the Boer/Afrikaans presence in Africa as well.  Whites simply should not be there, as blacks should not be in America.  If the two groups were not forcing each other to cohabit, there would not be a problem.\n\nI also do not believe that a lower median score on IQ tests, says anything about the inherent, general worth of a given ethnic group.  It ***is*** true, as far as I'm concerned, that IQ testing carries a cultural bias; it measures performance against the types of mental activities which are customary for whites.  You don't see whites being formally tested on hunting or other indigenous skills, and I'm guessing that if we were, a lot of us would do just as poorly as blacks are often claimed to on IQ tests.\n\nI am not a champion or advocate of contemporary Anglo/American society.  I think it is probably the single most degenerate civilisation that has ever existed on this planet, to the point where it seriously carries the potential for causing human extinction.  Yet at the same time, the levels of rage and vindictiveness that I have seen expressed online by Native Americans in particular, has told me that the indigenous model is nowhere near perfect either.  I don't know what the solution is for us at the moment; but I don't think that any particular racial or cultural group can truly claim to have it.\n\n*  Fascism.\n\nYou will be heavily exposed to fascist ideas and propaganda on 4chan, as well as sympathetic revisionism on the subjects of Adolf Hitler and the German Nazi party.\n\nMy perspective is that fascism is an inherently bogus (provably false) ideology.  Said ideology is based on two points; the Zero-Sum Game, and the supposed necessity of war as a catalyst for human development.  I believe that contemporary automation technology has to at least a certain degree rendered scarcity as a concept irrelevant.  I also believe that the falsity of the idea that modern war is in any way beneficial or desirable, should be entirely self-evident to any genuinely sane or lucid human being.  Unfortunately for most fascists I've known online, sane and lucid are not words that I can use to describe them.\n\n*  The Jewish Conspiracy.\n\nThe mythical, central, all-controlling Zionist conspiracy, is another one of those ideas which is simply unthinkable on Reddit.  You aren't merely forbidden from expressing it; holding it mentally is likely considered a literal thoughtcrime by most here.  It would supposedly take us back to the Holocaust if we were to seriously entertain it.\n\nThe problem with rejecting it, however, is the fact that there is such abundant evidence for it.  The Rothschilds, for example, are an incontrovertibly Jewish family, who Marx was (reasonably distantly, to be sure) related to, from a long line of rabbis.  Rand, von Mises, Friedman, and Chomsky (in other words, the most fundamental economic and social thinkers usually quoted by people these days) are all Jews as well.  Look into the ownership of Big Media and the Fortune 500; if you are objective about it, you will unavoidably start to notice a very uncomfortable ethnic pattern emerging.\n\nAm I advocating violent anti-Semitism, here?  No.  There ***is*** however, a fairly consistent and discernible tendency of Jewish individuals to occupy extremely influential positions within Western society.  If they do their jobs well, then that doesn't even need to be at all a bad thing.  All I'm saying is that whether it is positive or negative, it ***is*** there."}, {"id": "cne9bx8", "body": "I enjoyed reading your views on feminism and agree it is bullshit now.

So why would a bunch of social outcasts who get made fun of encourage hate and let such raw emotion reign supreme?  Quite honestly it dilutes it.  Getting called a *faggot* on 4chan constantly helps you to brush it off when you hear it on the street, and the nice thing about the anonymity of the 4chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more.  That last post you made someone made fun of you, well cool no one knows that the person who just made the post people are laughing at was the same post they were making fun of.  You're no longer the *faggot* you're the *comedian* until you make a new post and you're the *troll*.\n\n4chan style sites don't create pessimistic, negative, and depressed people it just attracts them and quite honestly it's nice to be able to show raw emotion and not have it permanently tied to your identity.  You never have to worry about people being like \"oh that dude, that dude always has problems -ignored-\"\n\nI've used 4chan a bunch of times to let out my problems about being depressed, suicidal and raped.  It's wonderful because I can let it all out and continue to be a member of that community without the community permanently tying what happened to me to my identity.\nIf I fully discussed my rape irl i was always going to feel broken because everyone I talked to would then associate it with my identity and it would be something I would never escape.

It will reach conspiracy theory levels of \"proof\" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.\n\nTo be fair that's not specific to 4chan and that phenomenon has been around forever(Tumblr's community is heavily guilty of this same thing).  It's also a product of individual stupidity, if your believing something random people are telling you without it being backed by proof and your own individual research, well that's your own gullibility.\n\n\nAs for 4chan making people into a worse person, I would strong disagree.  I'd say more it just lets people be free, free to test the waters and do whatever without your idea's, jokes, concepts tied to any identity.  Every thought stands of its own individual merits.\n\n\nI've been around 4chan since 2004 and the only way I would ever describe it would be *chaotic neutral*.  One day groups from or within it might organize some raid for the lolz, [another day they're saving a kitten,](http://www.inquisitr.com/18170/4chan-b-goes-after-cat-abusers-wins/) \n[finding the girl who threw a puppy in a river,](http://www.techhive.com/article/204615/Video_of_Puppies_Thrown_into_River_Spark_Outcry_and_Sleuthing.html) \n[saving a girl from bullying and suicide,](http://www.dailydot.com/news/anonymous-kylie-suicide-trolls-bully/) \n[paying some poor dudes rent,](http://i.imgur.com/kdYBh.jpg) \n[organizing against the harmful practices of a cult,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Chanology) \n[bringing more exposure to a rape victim,](http://www.dailydot.com/news/steubenville-rape-confession-video-anonymous/)\n[give some random vet the best birthday ever,](https://gigaom.com/2010/09/02/4chan-decides-to-do-something-nice-for-a-change/)\n[helping some guy buy food for his dogs,](http://i.imgur.com/tKwU3.jpg)\n[raising 5grand for a womens charity,](http://i.imgur.com/yGwmwN4.png)\n[raising 5grand for suicide prevention](https://www.crowdrise.com/nshgamers/fundraiser/loping) \n\nI've honestly seen more positive activism stem from the anonymity culture than I have from any other site.\n\nThe problem is a lot of people only understand the surface of chan boards like 4chan and equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech, but that couldn't really be further from the truth.  \n\n\nTo understand why the board encourages to *hate* is to understand who goes there and it's obviously the social outcasts.  So why would a bunch of social outcasts who get made fun of encourage hate and let such raw emotion reign supreme?  Quite honestly it dilutes it.  Getting called a *faggot* on 4chan constantly helps you to brush it off when you hear it on the street, and the nice thing about the anonymity of the 4chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more.  That last post you made someone made fun of you, well cool no one knows that the person who just made the post people are laughing at was the same post they were making fun of.  You're no longer the *faggot* you're the *comedian* until you make a new post and you're the *troll*.\n\n4chan style sites don't create pessimistic, negative, and depressed people it just attracts them and quite honestly it's nice to be able to show raw emotion and not have it permanently tied to your identity.  You never have to worry about people being like \"oh that dude, that dude always has problems -ignored-\"\n\nI've used 4chan a bunch of times to let out my problems about being depressed, suicidal and raped.  It's wonderful because I can let it all out and continue to be a member of that community without the community permanently tying what happened to me to my identity.\nIf I fully discussed my rape irl i was always going to feel broken because everyone I talked to would then associate it with my identity and it would be something I would never escape.  Even on reddit i was originally hesitant to be open about it because of the username system would tie it to my reddit identity.  But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief.

You can't have an echo chamber in a place that is hardly moderated, however because of subreddits, the mods of those subreddits can ban whomever disagrees with thier message. For example SRS. \n\nBut overall, using the internet doesn't make you a bad person. Even if you use 4chan and Reddit a lot chances are it does not translate at all with your personal and professinal relationships. You don't curse people out in real life and espouse your shitty views. Some people who can be easily influenced and swayed can do that, but its a small minority, like  bronies who try and translate thier experince to the real world.\n\nOverall pessism you are describing is one that simply comes from knowledge. Reddit and 4chan give you a but load of non bullshit information if you know how to decipher it and because of such you will have more negative views about humanity in general. \n\nWithout the filter, this how people really are. 4chan and reddit are reflection of users who use it, not the places themselves.
