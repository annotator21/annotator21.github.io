So I don't think is racist when someone prefers to date a white person over a black fellow. Or as someone I know said: \"My daughter can date anyone she wants, it's her life after all. But if I get to choose I choose choose a white folk over a black one\". So I think it would only be considered racist when it affects their rights (human rights, workplace rights, etc...) or when they think a skin colour means more than just that (prejudicing, stereotyping) Disclaimer: This question is 100% objective in a bio-psychological kind of way, I don't believe any race is superior over any other nor I share the preferences I used as example.\nEdit: To avoid misleading of this you can think of preference as \"\"you're more likely to be attracted to ___ than ___\".\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Often times these empirical facts simply don't exist as the evidence was destroyed in an attempt to cover up the crime or is otherwise inaccessible, or there wasn't any evidence to begin with. In many cases eyewitness testimony, as unreliable as it is, is the only evidence.\n\nEven if there is empirical evidence you often times end up with two cases where a car hit a person at 20 miles per hour at the time of the collision resulting in the death of the pedestrian. Guilty of murder, right? Except in one case a drunk individual stumbled into the road at night and the driver was unable to stop in time. In the other a jilted lover ambushed a victim. The only difference in these cases are intent, and intent cannot be objectively measured and therefore cannot be examined empirically. I don't think that the driver who didn't intend to cause harm and did everything a reasonable person would do to avoid the collision should be punished in the same manner as someone who made a decision to kill another person, and thus far the laws have been written to agree with position. So, I don't think that we can simply ignore the intent of actions simply because they cannot be verified.\n\nOften times cases come down to the *theory of the crime*, or both the prosecution and the defense presenting competing narratives that take all of the unknowable missing pieces, hidden motivations of the actors in the case, and the fragments of what we do know and make a coherent story out of them.

Often times these empirical facts simply don't exist as the evidence was destroyed in an attempt to cover up the crime or is otherwise inaccessible, or there wasn't any evidence to begin with. In many cases eyewitness testimony, as unreliable as it is, is the only evidence.\n\nEven if there is empirical evidence you often times end up with two cases where a car hit a person at 20 miles per hour at the time of the collision resulting in the death of the pedestrian. Guilty of murder, right? Except in one case a drunk individual stumbled into the road at night and the driver was unable to stop in time. In the other a jilted lover ambushed a victim. The only difference in these cases are intent, and intent cannot be objectively measured and therefore cannot be examined empirically. I don't think that the driver who didn't intend to cause harm and did everything a reasonable person would do to avoid the collision should be punished in the same manner as someone who made a decision to kill another person, and thus far the laws have been written to agree with position. So, I don't think that we can simply ignore the intent of actions simply because they cannot be verified.\n\nOften times cases come down to the *theory of the crime*, or both the prosecution and the defense presenting competing narratives that take all of the unknowable missing pieces, hidden motivations of the actors in the case, and the fragments of what we do know and make a coherent story out of them.

It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmzqmde", "body": "##Social Democracy For Everybody\n\nSocial Democracy only functions when countries hold a disproportionate amount of the wealth. Sweden, the model Social Democracy, holds 0.44% of the world's wealth while having 0.2% of its population. This allows states to maintain high cost, profitless systems. Ultimately, as the world develops and your state has an increasingly smaller share of its wealth, you're going to be forced to cut back on these programs or have a situation unsustainable in the Capitalist system. \n\nUltimately, if you actually believe in an equal world, you need Socialism, as Social Democracy can only exist on the backs of poor nations which hold very little wealth. It's exploitation. \n\nThe \"Scandinavian Model\" sounds great for Social Democrats, but the reality is that only a select few lucky to be born within certain borders can have the Scandinavian Model. You'll create a two-tiered world of elites and the poverty stricken - pretty much what we have now. Socialism is international, and everyone can benefit from it. \n\nSocial Democracy is, ultimately, a nationalist ideology that leads to the oppression of other nations. It cannot function in the long term without Imperialism.\n\nSo if it's the Scandinavian Model you're seeing as the endgame, you're not looking for a very long game.\n\n##Capitalism and Imperialism\n\nIn regards to Imperialism, you've commented that it is not linked to Capitalism. This could not be more wrong. While some forms of Imperialism can develop independently of it, it is an inevitable byproduct of the Capitalist system. A voluntary exchange of goods for mutual benefit is not possible when one side holds all the power in the exchange. This leads to unfair and involuntary exchange to one side's benefit. \n\nFor exchange to be voluntary and mutually beneficial, both sides of the exchange have to be equal in power so that one side cannot leverage the other into an unfair exchange. \n\nAs such, given that Capital is global(That is - American companies own and operate capital in, say Africa), Imperialism is going to be the natural byproduct as private entities try to secure the interests of capital. This is something we have seen time and time again - for example, the United Fruit Company in Honduras. \n\nSocialism on a global scale eliminates Imperialism, as Imperialism is a byproduct of private interests and as such Socialism would eliminate those private interests. \n\nThis is in contrast to Social Democracy, which requires Imperialism to survive through the extraction of wealth from other states and the accumulation of it at home. Should a state attempt to prevent you from extracting wealth from them, that would be a direct threat to your Social Democracy and way of life. As a rational actor trying to preserve your system, you must intervene.    \n\n##Markets and Innovation\n\nMarkets are not an innovative force. Most innovation that we enjoy today exists *despite* Markets. All the key innovations have been driven and sponsored by governments, not private interests in the Market. This is not to advocate for the all-powerful state, but it is to say that Markets are not innovative. Markets are a profit-driven system and as such all innovation that is in any way in risk of not creating a short term profit is going to fall by the wayside, and the the government(And consequently, public funds) do the innovation. \n\nElon Musk is seen as the new big deal in the space industry, but he would be nowhere without the government, which acted outside the Market.\n\nSo we're already seeing here, that while the Market can be used to distribute resources(Though in an inequal and unfair manner), it does not lend itself to innovation. As such, one would think that the elimination of the profit-motive as the central driving force would lend itself to *more* innovation. As such, a Planned Economic system, as found in Socialism, would be required, and the dissolution of the Market is going to be an inevitable byproduct. \n\n##On Market Inefficiencies and Human Need\n\nThe Market, as outlined, is not friendly to innovation. But even when it is, it does so in an inefficient manner. Companies will compete with eachother to innovate, leading to duplications in research, products, and general labour. As opposed to pooling resources, companies like Pharmaceuticals will all simultaneously be working towards the same cure. \n\nA Planned Economic system eliminates this issue. Resources are allocating on the basis of need, and not wasted in competition. \n\nOn top of this, due to the profit-motive, a Market system is totally indifferent to human suffering if those who are suffering are in poverty. Let's take the Ebola crisis, or Malaria even. Companies are slow to produce cures, vaccines, or even distribute these to populations, because it is not profitable to do so. We have a cure for Malaria yet it is the biggest killer disease in Africa. Because the Market doesn't care about poor people.\n\nSimilarly, we'd been close to discovering a cure for Ebola for a long time, but we stopped researching it because it wasn't a threat to developed nations. Ideas of cures and vaccines only started cropping up when Europeans and Americans got sick, and lo and behold, prototypes by the end of the week.\n\nIt is clearly demonstrable that on whatever level Markets distribute resources, it does it in a way that does not cater to human needs. If it doesn't do that, then I have to ask, what's the bloody point? Why protect systems that don't give us what we need? \n\nEven when it tries to, it can't do it in a way that manages resources efficiently. In a world where we need more and more innovation in order to survive with our increasingly scarce resources, we don't need to be *wasting* research hours and those scarce resources competing with eachother. \n\nAnd to top it all off, Markets are really undemocratic. The population has no actual, tangible say in the condition of the economy and what needs to be produced.\n\n##On Marxist theory of exploitation\n\n&gt;I have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards.\n\nYou say you don't see how Socialism would be better. The question is - better for who? Not the Capitalists and Business Owners, certainly not. \n\nBut if you don't see how a Socialist system eliminates worker exploitation, you either don't understand Surplus Value or are looking at something that isn't Socialism. If the working class owns the Means of Production, there's nobody that's extracting Surplus Value from their Labour. It all goes back to the workers. Almost by definition, seizure of Surplus Value by the working class is synonymous to seizure of the Means of Production.\n\nUnder the Capitalist system, including that of Social Democracy, the employer extracts Surplus Value from the worker because they privately own the Means of Production, as opposed to worker ownership in Socialism. This is how Socialism improves things - it *ends* worker exploitation by putting the workers in political and economic control. \n\n##On Capitalism Bringing Nations out of Poverty\n\nAbsolutely, Capitalism does have a very good ability to produce wealth. Quite similar to the Stalinist states of the Eastern Bloc, actually, which were very Economistic and were quite good at producing, contrary to popular belief. Due to the undemocratic nature of their Planned Economies, there were always assorted shortages which could've been solved, but other than that, there was continuous growth, high social safety nets, and very low unemployment. \n\nThis is not an endorsement of the Stalinist states, it's simply an acknowledgement that it's not just Capitalism that's good at making people not shit-poor. The guys in East Germany might not have had the fancy cars they had in West Germany, but they had housing, employment, education and healthcare - things *many* people went without in the Capitalist world for lack of money. \n\nIt's really a matter of priorities. Do I care about getting my iPhone or care about everybody not having to get worried about getting sick and dying because they're poor? Social Democracy may alleviate the symptoms and provide many of the these things, but again, that's a system based on Imperialism and exploitation. \n\nWhat these East Asian countries had was very powerful allies that invested heavily into their states for various reasons. \n\n##Supply &amp; Demand\n\nThe system of Supply &amp; Demand within the Capitalist framework absolutely does have legitimacy. But Marx would argue that there's only a value so low that a Capitalist can sell for. An analogy;\n\nI produce 100 computers. The cost of each computer was 100$. If I were to sell at less than 100$ I'm making an unsustainable loss. Essentially, if a business does not want to operate at a loss, there's only so low they can go. Supply and Demand is workable for moving from the Socially Necessary Labour Value, but for judging value on its own, it is not sufficient. \n\nOf course, there are some cases in which a Capitalist can take a short term loss for a long term benefit - for example, I could sell those computers below-cost in order to run a competitor out of business.\n\nIn order to stay competitive, I must always reduce the Socially Necessary Labour Value - which is tl;dr \"Cost of Labour\". I must cut wages, cut safety regulations, and so on. Social Democracy's answer to this is regulation, but will that work long term? \n\n##On 'Post-Scarcity'\n\nCapitalism isn't going to bring us to Post-Scarcity. As long as the new technological advancements are not owned by everybody. A factory of efficient machines that can produce endless amounts of material does nobody good if they're all owned by a select few who hold all the production of the world. \n\nPost-Scarcity requires a strong democracy by and for the workers. Anything other than Socialism wont work. \"Socialism or Barbarism\"."}, {"id": "2pqs9o", "body": "## Section I: Definitions of \"Social Democracy\" and \"Socialism\"\n\nSocial democracy \"is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmz9oid", "body": "So I'm kinda sad that you're not getting more responses to this, though I think the number of avowed socialists/communists here is really low.

Check back in an hour then!"}, {"id": "2pqs9o", "body": "## Section I: Definitions of \"Social Democracy\" and \"Socialism\"\n\nSocial democracy \"is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmzzcv1", "body": "* I'm on mobile, but if you care enough to read them there are two articles I'd want to point your way to challenge your assessment. The first is about the failure of the Nordic countries, their social democracy parties, and their unions to deal with the crisis of the 70s. In particular the author points to their increasing collaboration with neoliberalism and the failure of the trade unions to fight for ownership as opposed to wages in the face of the crisis of profitability, inflation, and oil prices. The second examines, through comparing East and West Germany the common assumption that eastern bloc firms/ central planning were more inefficient  then market indicators. In fact by several metrics East German firms were more efficient in resource allocation and productivity compared to their western neighbors. What the author points out is the poor financial capital appropriation to firms in communist states. This doesn't necessarily negate your argument, but rather I hope would provide nuance to the critique. \n\n* Have you read *Seeing Like a State(How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed)*? Scott goes over what he calls \"high modernism\" and how/why large earth restructuring projects have failed. Not a socialist book by any means, he documents how these schemes are independent of economic system. While often sold to those of us in the West as a natural defect of state communism, large scale planning is documented quite well in its historical roots under capitalism, it's implementation under colonial extraction, and it's embrace by communist regimes. To take one example, collectivized farms first occurred in America, the soviets had their's planned by Wisconsin professors in Chicago, and the largest implementation has been in the global South with respect to commodities (rubber, spices, Palm oil). This is just one example of how a problem gets associated with central planning when in fact all modern States preform it to various degrees. In fact I'd go so far as to say there is no state with out a central body planning some degree of resource distribution independent of \"market forces\". One of the foundations of state craft is the control over land and the setting of prices - all that changes is how encompassing this is. You already mentioned industries that you deem poor distributors under capitalism, such healthcare - what is different about the production of the commodities you find okay with bringing under government control and others? \n\n* I am wondering if you have read *Capital* or anything by David Harvey/Kalecki. Many of the criticism of capitalism comes from just more than Smith's LTV. In particular it is the unequal accumulation of capital by the capitalists which drive so many speculative bubbles and assets overvaluing. Far from a moral assessment, it is the very existence of this big pot of money which seeks rates of return inaccessible to saturated aggravate demand. There is this idea that supply and demand is outside of Marxism, when in reality Marxists very easily accept and understand. The real fight, as it is I guess, is with marginalism, since supply and demand is so self evident to a Marxist. We find that in fact it does not provide a serious prediction of the social relationship for the construction of value. This gets to my final point, which is I don't see any mention of debt. Rather than seeing market prices arising out of voluntary exchange of commodities, with the money commodity acting as the exchange medium, leftists see debt as fundamental to understanding economics, from the debt inherit in wage labor to the global decoupling from the gold standard to the T-note standard to the trillions of debt which has caused so many crises under capitalism. Where does debt enter into your understanding of wage labor, surplus value, and commodity exchange? What about non monetary debts, I. E. CO2, where future productive is leveraged for present productive. \n\nBut all in all good post, you have obviously  thought about this quite a bit. I am cool with social dems (which honestly if you drill down into what normal workers believe is what they really want out of politics) whom until we have built Finland worldwide I see as allies. I just want you to remember that those Nordic counties have strong socialist parties which push social dem politicians towards less capitulations with liberal parties, so if you can don't work to hurt socialist chances at the ballot box. "}, {"id": "2pqs9o", "body": "## Section I: Definitions of \"Social Democracy\" and \"Socialism\"\n\nSocial democracy \"is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmzgeno", "body": "This is a great post and I will get to answering it later.

It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmznuke", "body": "\"I believe that private property and markets distribution can be sources of good.\"\n\nMarkets are a tool, so they are neither bad or good.

They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmznzut", "body": "\"I believe that private property and markets distribution can be sources of good.\"\n\nPrivate property is trickier here. A certain amount of private property desirable since it grants dignity and personal security. So owning a home frees the homeowner of the fear of eviction. It also allows for greater participation in civic life.\n\nYet the concept of private property has been extended in a way that is too wide and hurts the world. The private ownership of water comes to mind.

Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmzb223", "body": "edit: this is my first reddit post so sorry if I am doing something wrong.\n\nFirstly, Socialism is an international, class-based ideology. It does not suit itself well to Americans because Americans have a completely different view of social class to any other group of people in the world. It's impossible to discuss class with Americans in my experience. And Socialism is an ideology that is focused around class above all things, so I think that is one reason it never kicked off in the US (as opposed to other Anglo countries like Britain where it was very popular.) \n\nSocialism has two promises: the material promise and the human promise. It promises the working class that it can provide a better life for them. Socialism is a fundamentally materialistic ideology. If Socialism can't provide a better life for the working people, it's pointless. The second promise is the promise of equality and decency. These are really less quantifiable. \n\nSocialism promises an alternative method of social organisation in which the workers control the means of production and their collective destiny. Social democracy does not propose an alternative method of social organisation. If you think the capitalist system is \"fine if we just tinker with it\" then you are a social democrat (as you have shown.) If you think we have to replace it then you are a Socialist.\n\nThe economic calculation problem is one of allocation of goods. The price of a good (i.e. its demand) determines how much of it should be produced relative to other goods. It is true that if you don't have prices then you have economic chaos. Socialism does not mean there will be no money, however. It does not mean there will be no prices. It means that the workers will control the means of production. \n\nWe need an efficient allocation and distribution system otherwise we can't promise the working class a better future. We need prices for that. But that doesn't compromise our goal, a classless society in which economic power is controlled democratically. Co-operatives that make bad decisions can go out of businesses, workers can be made unemployed. That isn't un-socialist. They can be retrained by government programmes and go back to work in a different co-operative. Basically nobody advocates a USSR type economy anymore and if they are they are idiots.\n\nYou spent only one paragraph dismissing market socialism (I hate that term, but more later) and your only reason was that it \"may not be\" efficient. What is efficient about capitalism is the price system and the role it plays in allocation of production and determination of prices. Everything else is pretty much waste. Waste, waste, waste. \n\nLet me give you an example. Something like 1 billion dollars worth of ugg boots were sold in 2012. This is efficient in the sense that - people wanted them and they were sold at a price that allowed them to be produced. This is not efficient in the sense that these boots are a complete luxury, pointless and unnecessary, and the resources dedicated to producing them - like most luxury goods - were really wasted.\n\nWorker co-operatives are not less efficient than any other form of corporation. That has never been shown - it has never been proven. The theory only says that incentives are the reason. People talk about incentives all the time, but they talk about incentives in their form of societal organisation. People can get rich! They can buy a car! Yea, we've all seen The Boiler Room. Suppose that you owned your own company, you were self-employed - how much satisfaction would you get from growing your business? Seeing it develop in a way you felt good? Yes, that is a commonly cited incentive. It's not an incentive for most people though because most people aren't self-employed. They're employed to grow somebody else's business. Give people a share in their work and they will be incentivised. Think about it. You spend 30% of your life at work. A full third of your existence. To dedicate that time doing something - building something - and having something to show for it: this is a great incentive and it has been proven to be so (MONDRAGON etc.)\n\nIf the working class controlled the means of production they wouldn't waste their time producing $10,000 watches or plastic surgery equipment for titjobs. These high-cost high-risk type of investments - luxury goods are usually high-risk wouldn't go anywhere. \n\nCapitalism is built on voluntary exchange. This is an extremely tendentious line of argument, and I think you know that. You even say it yourself - differentiate between the IDEAL and the THEORY. In reality, what is voluntary is often only nominal. Nobody wants to go to work for 250 dollars a month cleaning streets. They do it because they don't have any other choice, and in that sense it is voluntary. \n\nWomen's rights and capitalism (for example) are not antithetical. That being said, expecting people to be treated equally when the basis of capitalism is that nobody is treated equally to somebody else is a bit outrageous. \n\nI understand that social democracy is about saying \"hey look, here is our bottom line, you can go up from that but not below it.\" But here's the thing. The bottom line, like everything else in a capitalist society, is decided by the ruling class. All the resources of the world are distributed and from that a minimum is chosen. Maybe it's 250 dollars, maybe it's 500, maybe it's 750. It doesn't matter: the bottom line will never be high enough to threaten those with the entrenched power. You claim that social democracy is just \"saving\" capitalism, but what you're doing is just instituting rules that are acceptable to the ruling class. Socialism promises to sweep them away and we'll determine the bottom line when half the world's wealth isn't owned by 1%. \n"}, {"id": "cmzb223", "body": "edit: this is my first reddit post so sorry if I am doing something wrong.\n\nFirstly, Socialism is an international, class-based ideology.

And Socialism is an ideology that is focused around class above all things, so I think that is one reason it never kicked off in the US (as opposed to other Anglo countries like Britain where it was very popular.) \n\nSocialism has two promises: the material promise and the human promise. It promises the working class that it can provide a better life for them. Socialism is a fundamentally materialistic ideology. If Socialism can't provide a better life for the working people, it's pointless. The second promise is the promise of equality and decency. These are really less quantifiable. \n\nSocialism promises an alternative method of social organisation in which the workers control the means of production and their collective destiny. Social democracy does not propose an alternative method of social organisation. If you think the capitalist system is \"fine if we just tinker with it\" then you are a social democrat (as you have shown.) If you think we have to replace it then you are a Socialist.\n\nThe economic calculation problem is one of allocation of goods. The price of a good (i.e. its demand) determines how much of it should be produced relative to other goods. It is true that if you don't have prices then you have economic chaos. Socialism does not mean there will be no money, however. It does not mean there will be no prices. It means that the workers will control the means of production. \n\nWe need an efficient allocation and distribution system otherwise we can't promise the working class a better future. We need prices for that. But that doesn't compromise our goal, a classless society in which economic power is controlled democratically. Co-operatives that make bad decisions can go out of businesses, workers can be made unemployed. That isn't un-socialist. They can be retrained by government programmes and go back to work in a different co-operative. Basically nobody advocates a USSR type economy anymore and if they are they are idiots.\n\nYou spent only one paragraph dismissing market socialism (I hate that term, but more later) and your only reason was that it \"may not be\" efficient. What is efficient about capitalism is the price system and the role it plays in allocation of production and determination of prices. Everything else is pretty much waste. Waste, waste, waste. \n\nLet me give you an example. Something like 1 billion dollars worth of ugg boots were sold in 2012. This is efficient in the sense that - people wanted them and they were sold at a price that allowed them to be produced. This is not efficient in the sense that these boots are a complete luxury, pointless and unnecessary, and the resources dedicated to producing them - like most luxury goods - were really wasted.\n\nWorker co-operatives are not less efficient than any other form of corporation. That has never been shown - it has never been proven. The theory only says that incentives are the reason. People talk about incentives all the time, but they talk about incentives in their form of societal organisation. People can get rich! They can buy a car! Yea, we've all seen The Boiler Room. Suppose that you owned your own company, you were self-employed - how much satisfaction would you get from growing your business? Seeing it develop in a way you felt good? Yes, that is a commonly cited incentive. It's not an incentive for most people though because most people aren't self-employed. They're employed to grow somebody else's business. Give people a share in their work and they will be incentivised. Think about it. You spend 30% of your life at work. A full third of your existence. To dedicate that time doing something - building something - and having something to show for it: this is a great incentive and it has been proven to be so (MONDRAGON etc.)\n\nIf the working class controlled the means of production they wouldn't waste their time producing $10,000 watches or plastic surgery equipment for titjobs. These high-cost high-risk type of investments - luxury goods are usually high-risk wouldn't go anywhere. \n\nCapitalism is built on voluntary exchange. This is an extremely tendentious line of argument, and I think you know that. You even say it yourself - differentiate between the IDEAL and the THEORY. In reality, what is voluntary is often only nominal. Nobody wants to go to work for 250 dollars a month cleaning streets. They do it because they don't have any other choice, and in that sense it is voluntary. \n\nWomen's rights and capitalism (for example) are not antithetical. That being said, expecting people to be treated equally when the basis of capitalism is that nobody is treated equally to somebody else is a bit outrageous. \n\nI understand that social democracy is about saying \"hey look, here is our bottom line, you can go up from that but not below it.\" But here's the thing. The bottom line, like everything else in a capitalist society, is decided by the ruling class. All the resources of the world are distributed and from that a minimum is chosen. Maybe it's 250 dollars, maybe it's 500, maybe it's 750. It doesn't matter: the bottom line will never be high enough to threaten those with the entrenched power. You claim that social democracy is just \"saving\" capitalism, but what you're doing is just instituting rules that are acceptable to the ruling class. Socialism promises to sweep them away and we'll determine the bottom line when half the world's wealth isn't owned by 1%. \n"}, {"id": "cmzh2kz", "body": "##Part 1\n\nThank you very much for your well thought out comment!!

So these \u201cuseless\u201d products and services may still be supplied.\n\nIf you institute an equality of outcomes, then the above might not happen, but there are a lot of trade-offs to completely eradicating inequality, and I feel that the cons outweigh the pros, and such a system would be incredibly inefficient. \n\n&gt;Women's rights and capitalism (for example) are not antithetical. \n\nGood, I'm glad you acknowledge this. I know a lot of people who claim that you can\u2019t have women\u2019s rights, LGBT rights, black rights, etc., under capitalism, which I find absurd. Discrimination is viewed as a market failure, and a source of frictional unemployment, which must be corrected in order for labor markets to operate efficiently. \n\n&gt;That being said, expecting people to be treated equally when the basis of capitalism is that nobody is treated equally to somebody else is a bit outrageous.\n\n&gt;It doesn't matter: the bottom line will never be high enough to threaten those with the entrenched power. \n\nAs /u/Grill99 wrote, \u201cSocial democracy is not about a bottom line. It's understanding that markets are needed for efficiency in the allocation of goods, but those at the bottom don't have the opportunity to participate in these benefits, if they don't have a certain amount of wealth and education to begin with.\u201d\n\nThis issue can be solved with strong social democratic policies to facilitate equality of opportunity and upward mobility. Moreover, having the public financing of elections would go a long way in preventing an entrenched power (at least an economic one) from buying the political process. \n\nInequality exists under social democracy, but there isn\u2019t a monolithic \u201cruling class.\u201d Wealth concentration can be mitigated through wealth taxes, and the people at the top of the income ladder will constantly be changing due to upward mobility as a result of investments in education and childcare. \n\nAlso /u/Grill99, wrote, there is huge difference between the entrepreneur billionaire, the inheritance billionaire, and the Wall Street billionaire. We need to acknowledge these differences. \n"}, {"id": "cn0ejts", "body": "Yes, the marketplace is a democracy, but you wouldn't stand for any type of democracy in which I had one million votes and you had one hundred, except if it was a marketplace...\n\nI don't want to address any particular point by point, but of course you can feel free to. I don't think I have much of a chance of changing your views but I do want you to understand what it means to be a socialist and what we mean when we talk about socialism because I don't think you do. \n\nFunny fact: I used to be a very extreme libertarian. I am quite well read on their arguments and used a lot of them myself over the years, so nothing you are saying to me is new (I don't want to be rude with that, so sorry.) I'm going to ask you a lot of questions to which I do not have the answer to, because I'm not you. If you are serious about CMV then you should consider them seriously. That doesn't mean I think that if you consider them seriously you will believe in what I do, by the way.\n\nThe problem with social democracy is that you are piling a lot of \"improvements\" on a system you think needs to be worked on. Basic income is an example of that. Actually, I think basic income would be somewaht of a necessity in a market socialist system (I don't have a preferential word for that, I just call it democratic socialism, because command economics is fundamentally undemocratic.)\n\nSocial democracy is ok when you have loads of surplus capital to dump on the poor. But how was that social capital gained? Do you think countries like, say, India, could establish the system you have in mind? Is Nigeria rich enough to have a basic income? I assume you are American - I apologise if not - so how much of your political views are based around a situation created for your country and how much of it is something you could apply internationally? Yes, America is super fucking rich, but it has made itself so in a large part by subverting or controlling other countries. This is another thing Americans don't really get, and again I don't say it to be rude, but I say it to open your eyes. What really turned me away from right-liberalism was living overseas and thinking about my non-European heritage.\n\nIn theory, nothing is fundamental to capitalism. Not imperialism, not racism, not corporatism, not corruption. But the reality is much different, isn't it? Are you sure that what you're proposing is something you could see in real life, or something that you have thought of in your head alone? How much knowledge do you have of life in social democratic countries? \n\nThe point of socialism though is to analyse the power mechanics of a society. Who really controls a society? Who determines the direction it takes, who has a lot of power in their life and who are powerless? What you are talking about is placating the material condition of life in a capitalist system, which is very well and good. I grew up in Britain so I am used to social democracy. \n\nWe are not necessarily interested in equality of outcome. Neither do we care for meritocracy. The point is that in a capitalist society some people have incredible power and others have virtually no power at all. That is, power over their future as people. \n\nI would like to direct you to the Investment Theory of Politics, sometimes called the Investment Theory of Party Competition, if you've not heard of it already. You're advocating this social democratic system which will necessitate high taxes and regulations on the rich. Yet you are doing nothing to limit their power. Public funding of parties is one thing, but there are many, many more ways in which the rich control politics. I don't think I need to list them but I will if you like. How can you ensure your systems fair survival? \n\nMove on to class for a bit. Yes, there are differences inside classes. But class exists - everywhere in the world, even in America, where people have a distorted view of it. This is especially obvious if you move between classes. I don't mean to say that all rich people are conspiring for a single purpose. But there is a group of people who hold all the strength, and a group of people who control none of it (except their labour and bodies) and this is plainly an unequal situation in which a small minority have a lot of political power. They may not act in tandem, they may be completely different people, but they share a lot in common. And their common interests - in a capitalist society - always prevail.\n\nI will do another post later about why it would be necessary to have ONLY worker co-operatives/mutuals, rather than having them co-exist with corporations. "}, {"id": "cmzb223", "body": "edit: this is my first reddit post so sorry if I am doing something wrong.\n\nFirstly, Socialism is an international, class-based ideology. It does not suit itself well to Americans because Americans have a completely different view of social class to any other group of people in the world. It's impossible to discuss class with Americans in my experience. And Socialism is an ideology that is focused around class above all things, so I think that is one reason it never kicked off in the US (as opposed to other Anglo countries like Britain where it was very popular.) \n\nSocialism has two promises: the material promise and the human promise. It promises the working class that it can provide a better life for them. Socialism is a fundamentally materialistic ideology. If Socialism can't provide a better life for the working people, it's pointless. The second promise is the promise of equality and decency. These are really less quantifiable. \n\nSocialism promises an alternative method of social organisation in which the workers control the means of production and their collective destiny. Social democracy does not propose an alternative method of social organisation. If you think the capitalist system is \"fine if we just tinker with it\" then you are a social democrat (as you have shown.) If you think we have to replace it then you are a Socialist.\n\nThe economic calculation problem is one of allocation of goods. The price of a good (i.e. its demand) determines how much of it should be produced relative to other goods. It is true that if you don't have prices then you have economic chaos. Socialism does not mean there will be no money, however. It does not mean there will be no prices. It means that the workers will control the means of production. \n\nWe need an efficient allocation and distribution system otherwise we can't promise the working class a better future. We need prices for that. But that doesn't compromise our goal, a classless society in which economic power is controlled democratically. Co-operatives that make bad decisions can go out of businesses, workers can be made unemployed. That isn't un-socialist. They can be retrained by government programmes and go back to work in a different co-operative. Basically nobody advocates a USSR type economy anymore and if they are they are idiots.\n\nYou spent only one paragraph dismissing market socialism (I hate that term, but more later) and your only reason was that it \"may not be\" efficient. What is efficient about capitalism is the price system and the role it plays in allocation of production and determination of prices. Everything else is pretty much waste. Waste, waste, waste. \n\nLet me give you an example. Something like 1 billion dollars worth of ugg boots were sold in 2012. This is efficient in the sense that - people wanted them and they were sold at a price that allowed them to be produced. This is not efficient in the sense that these boots are a complete luxury, pointless and unnecessary, and the resources dedicated to producing them - like most luxury goods - were really wasted.\n\nWorker co-operatives are not less efficient than any other form of corporation. That has never been shown - it has never been proven. The theory only says that incentives are the reason. People talk about incentives all the time, but they talk about incentives in their form of societal organisation. People can get rich! They can buy a car! Yea, we've all seen The Boiler Room. Suppose that you owned your own company, you were self-employed - how much satisfaction would you get from growing your business? Seeing it develop in a way you felt good? Yes, that is a commonly cited incentive. It's not an incentive for most people though because most people aren't self-employed. They're employed to grow somebody else's business. Give people a share in their work and they will be incentivised. Think about it. You spend 30% of your life at work. A full third of your existence. To dedicate that time doing something - building something - and having something to show for it: this is a great incentive and it has been proven to be so (MONDRAGON etc.)\n\nIf the working class controlled the means of production they wouldn't waste their time producing $10,000 watches or plastic surgery equipment for titjobs. These high-cost high-risk type of investments - luxury goods are usually high-risk wouldn't go anywhere. \n\nCapitalism is built on voluntary exchange. This is an extremely tendentious line of argument, and I think you know that. You even say it yourself - differentiate between the IDEAL and the THEORY. In reality, what is voluntary is often only nominal. Nobody wants to go to work for 250 dollars a month cleaning streets. They do it because they don't have any other choice, and in that sense it is voluntary. \n\nWomen's rights and capitalism (for example) are not antithetical. That being said, expecting people to be treated equally when the basis of capitalism is that nobody is treated equally to somebody else is a bit outrageous. \n\nI understand that social democracy is about saying \"hey look, here is our bottom line, you can go up from that but not below it.\" But here's the thing. The bottom line, like everything else in a capitalist society, is decided by the ruling class. All the resources of the world are distributed and from that a minimum is chosen. Maybe it's 250 dollars, maybe it's 500, maybe it's 750. It doesn't matter: the bottom line will never be high enough to threaten those with the entrenched power. You claim that social democracy is just \"saving\" capitalism, but what you're doing is just instituting rules that are acceptable to the ruling class. Socialism promises to sweep them away and we'll determine the bottom line when half the world's wealth isn't owned by 1%. \n"}, {"id": "cmzcq3x", "body": "&gt;It does not suit itself well to Americans because Americans have a completely different view of social class to any other group of people in the world.\n\nCorrect.

Because you say that Socialism promises higher quality of life, but is \"materialistic ideology\".\n\nI'm not wanting to get in the way of you guys here, but in this case I think it's obvious that [you don't know what materialism is in the way he's using it](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369034/materialism)."}, {"id": "2pqs9o", "body": "## Section I: Definitions of \"Social Democracy\" and \"Socialism\"\n\nSocial democracy \"is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmz6q2k", "body": "&gt;it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare \n\nYou stated that socialism hinders incentives and innovation because it gets in the way of the market forces. \n\nThose regulations have often the same effects on the market.

The market over produces negative externalities, when firms do not take into account external costs to society during the production process (like pollution). This often necessitates government intervention. Then you have information failures and asymmetric information (such as what happened during the 2008 financial crisis when investment banks couldn't adequately calculate risk, and investors thought the mortgage backed assets were sounder than they actually were, and consumers suffered from predatory lending). There are also volatile prices in commodities that may require a government stabilization scheme. Also, a big market failures is imperfect competition (especially monopolies and oligopolies) that may require government regulation (unless it's a natural monopoly). Finally, there is the case of labor market failures, where there's an inequality in access to education and training, labor market rigidity, occupational immobility, a skills gap, etc., and other stuff that will require government intervention.\n\nIf you subscribe to Keynesian macroeconomics, then government intervention is needed to smooth out the business cycle. \n\nSo the government has to provide that. Similarly, it has been shown that government is more efficient at providing healthcare than the private sector (due to overhead costs, competition, advertising, etc. among private health insurance providers).\n\nThe minimum wage is a complicated case: you are correct in that it hinders the efficiency of market forces when markets are competitive. But in cases where there is only one employer in an area, or only a few employers (monopsony and oligopsony respectively), then the minimum wage can actually improve efficiency by preventing employers from artificially reducing wages and employment.\n\nThere are many government interventions that enhance the free market: interventions such as infrastructure spending, spending on education, anti-trust policies to encourage competition, public-private partnerships, cap-and-trade policies (to enable sustainable growth), a legal system to defend property rights, and other market institutions.\n\nBasically, you can have freer markets with more governmental rules. We need to transcend the basic mindset that government intervention and capitalism are mutually exclusive.\n\nPolitical economist Steven Vogel states \"Market competition is not incompatible with a substantial government role in the marketplace beyond that of a referee.\" The market reform process, as vogel argues, in order to liberalize and make 'free' requires possibly building \"More\" institutions to create competition which is at the heart of most liberalization reforms. The example he uses is the Telephone industry, in which due to massive economies of scale, would naturally arise as a monopoly. It takes the governments hand and regulation in order to promote competition in this area. I.E. Forcing the owner of a monopoly of cell lines to \"lease\" them out to competitors in order to break up the market forces. Every step in deregulation, as vogel argues, is met in many cases with a match of 'reregulation' in which institutions are created to either 'protect society'(Sounds a lot like the double movement), or the creation of rules to promote competition. Overall, a this is very good outlay of why contemporary beliefs of the negative relationship between less rules and more competition is farfetched. In certain circumstances and sectors this may be the case, but not all.\n\nBut it is definitely true that government intervention can be bad, and can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. You brought up industry subsidies, bailouts, etc., as examples of crony capitalism. There's also the case of how means-tested welfare can reduce incentives for work, which is why I prefer a system of basic income. We need to get rid of onerous regulations and interventions. But it's not true that government is inherently inefficient, and that the private sector is inherently more efficient. We need to look at it on a case by case basis: markets do some things better, and governments do some things better, and markets and governments can have a symbiotic relationship.\n"}, {"id": "cmza75b", "body": "Thanks for the comment, but I wanted to clarify a few things.

The first, is the market fails because government got involved.  Such as when government guarantee bad loans in the housing market, that creates a bubble that is sure to burst as all bubbles do.\n\nThe second kind of failure, is when the market IS operating in optimal conditions, but this is not politically favorable.  If GM makes cars people don't want to buy, GM will go bankrupt.  This is presented as a market failure, but it's actually a market signal  that GM should not continue what they have been doing.  This is really a political problem concerning contributions and votes, blamed on the markets.\n\nMarkets keep trucking along unless otherwise prevented.  Firms may fail, whole industries may die.  Those are not market failures.\n\nWhat is true, is government people have no real stake in being efficient.  Which is why all governments tend toward inefficiency.  The bureaucrat doesn't really care that the billion dollars being spent on a bridge to nowhere is being squandered.  It doesn't come out of his pocket, and his job is to spend the money allocated anyway thus it's in his interest to be squanderous as a means of job security."}, {"id": "cmza75b", "body": "Thanks for the comment, but I wanted to clarify a few things. So I'm saying that market forces in general are effective, and it's best to leave most things to the private sector. However, when left to their own devices, markets will fail to allocate the optimal amount of goods and services in several sectors. These are called market failures, and they often necessitate government intervention to improve the outcome in the market. \n\nThe free-market cannot provide an effective national defense, for example. Same with other public goods, like a judicial system, street lights, etc. Similarly, there are goods that markets underproduce: quasi-public goods (like roads), and merit goods, like education and healthcare (supplying more of these goods would reduce private firms' profits). The market over produces negative externalities, when firms do not take into account external costs to society during the production process (like pollution). This often necessitates government intervention. Then you have information failures and asymmetric information (such as what happened during the 2008 financial crisis when investment banks couldn't adequately calculate risk, and investors thought the mortgage backed assets were sounder than they actually were, and consumers suffered from predatory lending).

I definitely appreciate your knowledge and intellect!\n\nWe both have a similar philosophy in that we both strongly support capitalism and markets. We feel that it empowers consumers, and facilitates growth, innovation, efficiency, etc. \n\nI'm glad to also know that we both support basic income. You know, under a basic income scheme, traditional means-tested welfare programs could be eliminated, and minimum wage regulations need not be necessary. Also, it will increase the bargaining power of workers w/o the need for unionization. So we can both agree that basic income satisfies both our desires, both mine as a social democrat, and yours as a libertarian. \n\nIf I had to be a bit picky, I would say that while it's true that most product markets in the U.S. aren't monopolies or oligopolies (the most common market structure is monopolistic competition), across the globe, I believe that oligopolies are the most common, but I'm not exactly sure. I need to double check that. But we need to differentiate product markets from factor markets (which include labor markets). It's possible to have a competitive product market while simultaneously having a noncompetitive labor market (allowing the firm to artificially drive down wages). Here, the minimum wage could be a solution. But like I said, I feel that basic income is superior. \n\n&gt;You seem to have some knowledge of economics, so I'm sure you understand that there is disagreement on this between Austrians and Keynesian.\n\nActually my position on market failures is relatively mainstream. It's what mainstream microeconomics teaches you, and this is accepted by both saltwater economists (the Keynesians), and the freswhater economists (the Milton Friedman-style Chicago school \"New Classical\" economists). Chicago-school economists recognize many market failures, and they diverge with Austrians in many cases (chicago school economists believe the Fed has a role in regulating monetary policy, for example), although in general, they feel tend to be more skeptical of government intervention to correct market failures than the Keynesians. \n\nYour position is a heterodox one (outside of the mainstream). Not that it's bad or anything :P, and I definitely respect several Austrian economists like F.A. Hayek, and Joseph Schumpeter.\n\n&gt;I think we have a similar philosophy, but we just disagree on some those individual cases like healthcare and the minimum wage.\n\nI see markets as the default best way, and than governments as the \"safety net\" for in the rare cases when markets fail (often because of outside forces).\n\nYeah pretty much!

It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmze1rk", "body": "private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. \n\nYou have no supporting facts or examples.

Even though the government's role is limited in capitalism, one of its jobs is to protect private property rights. This will include intellectual property rights through patents. Hence, there are incentives in the free market system for firms to be innovative and produce better quality products. There is not much incentive for a central planner to be innovative. As long as the essentials are produced, the planners will be happy. \n\nDecentralized planners may be more open to innovation, but b/c socialists oppose private property, I feel that capitalism is still the best system for innovation. \n\nCapitalism is inherently characterized by specialization and division of labor. You can read Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" for further information. Under capitalism, freedom of enterprise means that entrepreneurs and businesses have the freedom to be in business. which means that they can obtain and use resources, produce products of their choice, and sell these products in the markets of their choice. Similarly, workers can choose the training, occupations, and job of their choice. And consumers are free to spend their income in such a way as to best satisfy their wants.\n\nThis allows people to take advantage of differences in abilities and skills. Specialization saves time involved in shifting from one task to another. Specialization facilitates economic growth because it allows us to enjoy a greater volume of output.\n\nMarkets are dynamic - what is efficient today may not be efficient tomorrow as tastes, technology, and resource supplies change. Prices help signal those changes and the market will respond. An increase in demand for some products (fruit juice) will lead to higher prices in those markets; a decrease in demand for other products (milk) will lead to lower prices in those markets. Increased demand leads to higher prices that induce greater quantities of output from suppliers. The opposite is true for a decrease in demand.\n\nThe guiding function of prices is essential to a well-functioning market system.

It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmze2ab", "body": "Capitalism cannot take advantage of both automation and employment."}, {"id": "cmze2ab", "body": "Capitalism cannot take advantage of both automation and employment."}, {"id": "cmzjj1r", "body": "You are certainly correct that capitalism in a laissez-faire and unregulated form can't take advantage of both automation and employment.

It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmznem0", "body": "How do you regulate a corporation/person will a billion dollars unless you also have a billion dollars?  If you made it impossible to keep so much money that might work again like it did right after the great depression, but good luck getting that passed as a law."}, {"id": "2pqs9o", "body": "## Section I: Definitions of \"Social Democracy\" and \"Socialism\"\n\nSocial democracy \"is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmztsii", "body": "&gt;Cuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. This can be viewed as a form of state socialism \n\nThey can't be viewed as state socialism.\n\n*The* integral piece of state socialism is *democratic control of labor and collective ownership.* Cuba is the only one that *sort of* falls under this category. You must recognize the USSR as an attempt that was corrupted into fascism, China as state *capitalism*, and North Korea as a 1984-esque \"use the word socialism to pacify the masses\" state. Without doing these things, you are not having an honest discussion about socialism. Criticize authoritarianism (North Korea), corruption (China), or tactics (USSR re: dictatorship of the proletariat). In the case of Cuba, far too little criticism is aimed at the US for covert attempts to undermine the government and all-out economic siege.\n\n&gt;Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living \n\nI don't think capitalism does that at all. *People* do that through democratic efforts that are in direct opposition to capital. Owners use every last dollar they have to inflict their will over politicians, to the point that groups of marginalized people must fight both the corporations and governments that protect them.\n\n&gt; However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor), and excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net.\n\nYou keep using \"exploit\" without defining it. Workers create more value than they are compensated for, and have no say over the use of the profits. That's Marxist exploitation. The problem is beyond the fact that the **majority** of workers aren't paid a living wage - it's that the profits are actively used against the workers interests. That is, simply violence. \n\nYour system solves this by legislating fair wages. You use Scandinavian countries as an example. Great, Swedish Ikea workers get a decent wage. Who doesn't? Ikea workers in the US, and the people who make the crap in China.\n\nYou also never once mention alienated labor.\n\nBeing human is to be creative. To have control over your work and to do what you love. Working at McDonald's or in an assembly factory in Bangladesh would still be shit at $50/hour. **There is a reason we love democracy - people have the right to self-determination.** Our economy needs democratization MORE than our government.\n\nCapitalism insists upon inflicting the desires of the wealthy over the voices of the poor. The US government routinely overthrows democratially elected governments it doesn't like. It established a sweatshop in Haiti with the support of a hated president after removing a beloved anti-business one from leadership. The democratically voted minimum wage was undermined by the STATE DEPARTMENT to help out Hanes and Levis and other US interests.\n\nSocial Democracy is not democracy. It is neoliberalism, and economic fascism shrouded in pacifying benefits that extend only as far as those who have the ability to take action against it.\n"}, {"id": "2pqs9o", "body": "## Section I: Definitions of \"Social Democracy\" and \"Socialism\"\n\nSocial democracy \"is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.\"\n\nI really like the political economic structures of Scandinavian nations. The basic idea of a \"social democracy\" is that \"the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\n \nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\n\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\n\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \n\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China's current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping's dual-track market reforms). \n\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \n\nI'm fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I'm more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I'm also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \n\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\n\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn't \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \n\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren't more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \n\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\n\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\n\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\n\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \n\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \n\nIt's important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It's not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn't cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don't see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we've observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\n\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn't mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn't be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn't be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn't inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \n\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\n\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \n\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don't need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don't happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We've gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\n\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I've also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don't own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \n\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don't have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn't exist. That's why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven't lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \n\nIt's certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that's a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there's no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don't simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \n\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don't go up, and wages don't always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm's bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\n\nSo that's why I'm not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don't see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it's fine for a business owner or manager (who isn't a worker) to make a profit, it's fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it's a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\n\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \n\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur's application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly's product, and this is important to note).\n\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it's better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don't go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, \u201cthe science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\u201d And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can't adequately supply isn't proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\n\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \n\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I'm also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \n\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \n\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it's still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \n\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\n\nIn my view, it's essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can't get it wrong and can't harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \n\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I'm sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I'm definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn't be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don't think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \n\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France's system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \n\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don't include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people's income potentials.\n\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I'm also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he's not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn't want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\n\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there's strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there's strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we'd even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It's just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\n\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one's marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \n\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\n\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\n\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\n\nI'm against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn\u2019t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It\u2019s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \n\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\n\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don't really feel them anymore, they still exist. You're not truly free.\"\n\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \n\nAlso I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe\u2019s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women\u2019s rights and capitalism aren\u2019t antithetical, and it\u2019s bizarre to claim that they are.\n\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\n\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn't inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \n\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a 'periphery' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the 'world system.' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\n\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can\u2019t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \n\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn't be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn't prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \n\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \n\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it's a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn't'\"capitalism.' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\n\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \n\nIt's important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn't happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren't successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn't engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \n\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can't say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \n\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It\u2019s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn\u2019t dealt with it, if we don\u2019t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don\u2019t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections."}, {"id": "cmz9zwc", "body": "No economic system is inherently better.

But no one's being ignored; utilitarianism needs to take into account the well-being of all conscious creatures. The more people who are dissatisfied with some economic system, the further it is from being optimal.\n\n&gt;Are they then forced to participate in this system? By what right does anyone have to force them? Are they allowed to abandon a society which does not serve them?\n\nIf by 'forced' you mean participating without consent, not at all. As with most societies, people would consent to an ideal society's taxes, laws, etc, by living in that society, and could decide to live elsewhere (consenting not meaning 'to want', but 'to contract'). This is the means of establishing implicit consent that we've always used, i.e. the social contract. Just as we take ordering food at a restaurant to imply consent to pay for that food, because this is a useful means of establishing consent, we take living in society to mean consent to pay for certain public programs, to abide by certain rules, etc, because this is the most useful means of establishing whether someone consents to live in a society.\n\nIn a second sense of the word force though, in which being forced means having little ability to do otherwise, most people are always going to be forced to live in whichever society they're born. This is because speaking a certain language, being familiar with a certain culture, having certain connections, etc, all conspire to make the idea of moving elsewhere extremely unpalatable for most of us; we have little choice but to live under any particular society.\n\n&gt;What law of nature gives any person or arbitrary state the right to force any person to participate in any economic system? And if they do have that right, should all people have that right?\n\nI'm getting a 'natural rights' vibe from you. Morality relates to how we should behave overall; that's always the overarching question. Rights are just a shorthand way of addressing this question, and talking about what we should do. We don't literally 'have' rights; to say that I have a right to X, or a right to do/use X, is just a convention meaning that others should behave in a certain way towards me. And what we 'should' do relates to what's best for societal well-being. The question you should be asking is simply, \"Is it better or worse for societal well-being (i.e. moral or immoral) for a state to force certain people to live under it?\""}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2pqpjh", "body": "A lot of people on the internet, especially on Reddit, seem to really like piracy.

You are not actually stealing a product that costs money to replace. There's no actual loss when someone makes a copy of a digital file. It's just an imagined loss, an assumption that the downloader would otherwise have been willing and able to pay for the thing. Many people download stuff they never would have paid for in the first place. Also, In many cases, a person who pirates software or media might go on buy a legal copy after they realized the product is worth the money.\n\nIt's not right to illegally pirate content; depriving creators of funding they need to continue creating.  But It's also not right to say pirating is the same as stealing from a store. That's at best an oversimplification. But it's also invalid because there's no physical object lost. I think this trouble is a result of times changing and eventually we'll get over it and come up with new ways of distributing and consuming media. In the meantime, piracy has shades of moral grey area. I think one good thing to come of file sharing is a spirit of openness and cooperation.

How do you feel about dropping piracy in favor of a service similar to \"Game Time\"?\n\nCompanies benefit from piracy as it is done now. Most people don't pirate games, but having the small number of people who do pirate is helpful because they have just become a free reviewer that is more likely to be trusted by people because they know that person better than they do IGN or PCGamer. The pirate's friends are going to have a lot better of an idea about a game because the pirate got the game and played it than they would if they read a review from Kotaku or watched a video from TotalBiscuit. Piracy helps in a similar way to Let's Players, they show the unfiltered experience in a way that no review can. Piracy can do the exact same thing. That's also the reason why opening up Game Time to a year's demo is bad idea. The companies would lose SO much money on this because any advertising they got from pirates they just lost because the people are playing it free on Game Time. What really should happen is give people a few days to play a game (time will vary based on game, so something like Dragon Age would get at least a week, while Call of Duty would only need about a day or two). Of course, some players would finish a game like Dragon Age in the week they had, but the vast majority would get maybe a zone or two in and then be cut off. By then they'd be hooked and would buy it (on sale, most likely) to finish the game. Games like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike, people would buy if they liked it and have a huge reason to buy it after they're time was up because they can keep playing it until the servers shut down or the sequel comes out (which they would be more likely to buy if they like the first game). If a service like this was implemented across the board by GoG, Steam, Desura, Humble, etc, game piracy would almost cease to exist on PC.
