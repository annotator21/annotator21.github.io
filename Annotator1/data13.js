However, each board has a very different culture that has its positives and its negatives. Additionally, some of the \"negative\" attitudes you are referring to are just a tendency to be more critical than the average person which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nI have found the tendency of these boards is to be abrasive to those who are simply casually interested in something and to be really for those who are passionately interested in something. For example I primarily browse /mu/ and /lit/ and the content on those boards is not for those who just want to listen to an album maybe once a year and read YA fiction. The culture of both of these boards have challenged me to take my hobbies seriously (albeit in a very critical way). This can be very hard on people, but I've found I've come out the other end more invested in life and my hobbies in general. This is true of most hobby related boards.\n\nAlso, I've found that browsing the board has led me to take less seriously people who are that negative both on the board and in real life. I've learned after awhile that just because someone is extremely negative and critical of something doesn't make them right or above the thing they are criticizing. You have the critics in real life who take this position and people flock to them because they have strong opinions and it makes them sound like they know what they are talking about. When you realize that people on the internet can sound the same and have no idea what they are talking about one can become more discerning about these opinions. I think many would agree with me. With regards to the hatred of those groups, you learn how people can make themselves sound legitimate and spin the narrative. Before 4chan, these narratives might have taken me in, but now I know better and can see what people like that are doing.\n\nEverything you said is right, but you miss the full the picture and the positives that can come from it. Am I perhaps a more critical person and maybe even cynical person from browsing 4chan? Yes. However, I am also a more passionate person who knows what is like to be really invested in one's hobbies. \n\nOn a final note, I think it is important to take the website in small doses and accept it for what it is. People who spend all of their time on there and don't balance it out with a legitimate interest in something else are often the ones who make the place so negative (shitposters). When I read a book or listen to an album there are people out there who are often just as passionate as I am and can discuss it with me (albeit in a very critical way) and it is good to have that place."}, {"id": "2rawgb", "body": "Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.

If you think the majority of users have a \"general pessimistic group mentality\", then I would offer /mlp/ and Katawa Shooujo General.

KSG has been having thousands of threads where people talk about their favorite characters from the VN or about how reading KS has brought positivity into their life. I can personally attest to this as well, since KS caused me to actually start exercising when I had previously been a couch potato, using [this c25k image](http://i.imgur.com/bmbP0u7.png). Katawa Shoujo itself is also an example of something positive to come out of 4chan, since it was a visual novel created by 4chan users after getting inspired by a sketch made by RAITA, a Japanese artist. They didn't do it out of greed, since they were doing it for free. KS itself has resonated with thousands upon thousands of readers, and has inspired several readers to excercise, socialize, draw, read, and write more.

For reference, I don't consider myself a regular on 4chan, but I binge on /vg/ and /vp/ from time to time.\n\nWhile what you brought up about hating on specific groups certainly exists, some people (myself included) are just there to talk about video games. Without being offensive in the slightest, /vp/ linked me to the tutorials that I used to learn how to breed competitive Pokemon, and explained everything that I was still confused about. The Five Nights at Freddy's general inexplicably came out of nowhere and produced a lot of quality fan art and fanfiction, eventually evolving into a place where all original creations were welcomed and a generally positive mentality was established. There was even the time that I participated in the Typhlosion threads on /vp/, where we spent the better part of four days or so doing nothing but posting pictures of Typhlosion because it's cute and badass. There wasn't any bickering, discrimination, or inane arguments, just people with shared interests swapping cool pics. \n\nI also don't find myself impacted by my time there. I understand the serious weight behind a lot of common insults used there, and I don't use them myself, even while anonymous. 4chan has not robbed me of my intrinsic optimism, either; I spent a good bit of time bringing it to them by anonymously giving words of encouragement where they were needed. I've been consoled by anons when venting about stuff from work or college, as well. \n\nNow, my experiences do not change the fact that 4chan also has the sorts of threads and posters that you described. Anonymity certainly does bring out the worse in some. However, though they can be prevalent on other boards from what I've heard, I can safely say that I didn't run into them much. Overly rude or offensive posts were even semi-frequently accompanied by reminders to report them without replying, and posts that ignore what another person was saying entirely because of what groups they belong to were usually laughed at. Overall, I believe that using 4chan has not made me any worse of a person, and that there are decent people on there if you look for them. \n\nI also had a problem with this line: \"Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.\" I think that the reverse is also true: some people are legitimately unaffected, instead of unaware.

This side is normally censored and hidden away. 4chan reminds me of how the Internet was (to me) in the 90's. It was a place of complete and total anonymity and we were happy with it that way. If we wanted to put ourselves out there, we could but we weren't encouraged to do so as a societal norm. If we offended the wrong person, we'd get hacked but not our entire lives potentially ruined while people laughed about it! \n\n\nAbout pessimism and what not, the world isn't a friendly place. You're only going to take in what you choose to expose yourself to. If you only exposed yourself to /b/ or /pol/, you will be affected. At the same time, if you only viewed /r/spacedicks/ or /r/wtf/, you're probably going to be affected in some way as well. There's a happy medium to be made that exists. I use the chans as often as reddit. They both are have excellent parts plus really shitty parts. \n\n\nTo un-ironically call 4chan an echo chamber while on reddit is the most absurd thing I've read for quite some time. Reddit has always been a big hugbox for pseudo-intellectualism, sophomoric \"me too\" inside joke threads that go on forever, and feel-good emotional bullshit. 4chan, there's no upvotes. There's a lot of noise on 4chan, but you can navigate past it and find some excellent content. See a thread you want to comment on, go in and drop a bomb. Leave if you want, if you don't, keep hitting F5. You can ignore someone, sure, but their comment will be right up top where yours is chronologically on any of the chans.  If someone hurts your feelings, either pick it apart or ignore it. It is really like hard to just piss off? \n\n\nIf I see a big news story break, I am going to hear about it on 4chan before reddit 99.9% of the time. Why? Reddit has a bunch of dickheads trying to start a thread from the same link (all racing for karma) and then the thread will have to gain enough momentum to appear on the front page so unless I'm in the /new/ wasteland, I am behind the curve. 4chan may have it posted multiple times within seconds/minutes as well, but the one with the most enticing headline and immediate comments will always appear on the front page (or at least in the catalog) and the successful thread is the one used to near capacity, then redirected to the next big thread all the while without karma whores pushing eachother for control...the would-be karma whores are simply wasting their time trying to use a thread that's not as popular about a same topic. So while I've already discussed the news of the day on 4chan, I can discuss the news of yesterday on reddit. \n\n\nI think that people that openly hunt down those they don't agree with online IRL are the reason people use 4chan and other anonymous forums. After a night of drinking even on reddit, I check my comments and prune them accordingly even though I only have a handful of friends that know who I really am. I don't want any of these fascist politically correct fuckbags bothering me IRL. In fact, to think that people like this even exist make me a bit nauseous. SJWs. women, Jews, blacks, etc are protected classes as it is politically incorrect to attack them, the winners of the war write the history, the educators revise the history etc etc. If someone is an asshole and \"triggers\" someone into doing something, it's sad, but the \"triggered\" still makes their own choice. We are not robots. \n\n\nPeople trying to, at the very least, change freedom of speech into something else are weak and pathetic human beings. When sites like 4chan are banned from the Internet one day it will be a very sad day. Those seeking real ID programs and the like are technocratic fascists and no, I don't give a shit about their feelings because they don't give a shit about mine! In fact, those hoping for an Internet with real IDs, I hope people come after them with pitchforks!\n\n"}, {"id": "2rawgb", "body": "Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.

You know *more* than just a painting. I really don't think that most modern art really should be characterized of it.\n\nMoreover, \"bad\" older art definitely existed. It's just that those pieces aren't the ones that we see. They were destroyed, painted over, or simply not displayed. There have always been \"lower effort\" art going all the way back, it's just that we have a very distorted view of what art is/was like. Just as the people in a few hundred years wouldn't know anything about the random streaks of paint on canvas paintings.\n\nReally, what you have to realize is that a lot of modern art museums buy pieces based on who is doing the work more than what that particular work is. This is the result of the hero worship of Monet and the Dutch Masters. As long as the \"brand name\" of the piece is the reputation of the artist then you will have an industry dedicated to artificially manufacturing that reputation in order to get large sums of money out of collectors and museums who are trying to get in on the ground floor of this decade's Monet.\n\nSome contemporary art, however, really is intentionally low effort and garbage. They were trying to mock the artificial nature of the industry that cynically profits off inducing collectors and institutions to shell out money on faux-intellectualism and the word of self-appointed critics. They were trying to stretch the definition of \"art\" so far that it snaps, but it didn't snap. It never snapped. The act of trying to create anything but art became an art in and of itself in context, but that is lost to the average person who doesn't understand how or why the piece was created in the first place.\n\nA lot of modern art won't stand the test of time, and will be eventually discarded as genuinely better pieces gradually filter back out of private collections and new artists forge warranted reputations. It just takes a lot of time and effort to get the same sort of polished collections that we expect from Art Museums. In Savannah I actually saw a period collection of art. It was put together in the early-mid 1800's from pieces contemporary to the collector, most of the work was astonishingly mediocre. The kind of thing you could get from a guy painting in the part, and a lot of period plaster casts of sculptures in Europe that have long since been replaced by better art. I think that it's the limited period of time and how art is promoted and sold that is the real problem with modern art, not that modern art is inherently inferior or consists primarily of low effort pieces."}, {"id": "2r94wr", "body": "When visiting the Boston Museum of Fine Arts today with one of my buddies, him and I talked both agreed that many of the contemporary pieces looked as if someone effortlessly dumped different paint colors on a canvas.

We started by studying the great, realistic art of the Renaissance period where the value of the art was immediately apparent. We learned all sorts of fundamental artistic principles by studying that art; things like visual balance, good use of focal points, making sure the viewer's attention is directed throughout the entire painting and doesn't stall for too long at one point. All sorts of techniques you could clearly see all the great artists using to make their art as good as it could be.\n\nAs we moved along the different art periods throughout history, sure enough, those same techniques and principles existed all the way throughout, up to and including contemporary art. Sure enough, those paint splashes that seemed entirely random and thoughtless also possessed the same sort of visual balance, the same flow through the image, the same use of focal points, and all those same techniques. And that was, we were taught, the *entire point* of the contemporary movement. To move those techniques away from hyper realistic scenes and to capture the \"true essence of art.\"\n\nNow, if that's actually what the artist had intended, or simply pretentious people trying to act like something is extremely profound when it's really not, I can't say. But what I did come to understand was that it didn't really matter. The intent of the author, the effort expended, and the \"objective beauty\" (if such a thing even exists) of the piece is totally and utterly irreverent. The point of art, the thing that gives it value isn't any of that, it's the audience. It's you looking at the art and interpreting it. If you just see garbage then that's exactly what it is.

That simply isn't the case.

In your mind, it is not rational to go risk your lives for African strangers and potentially risk bringing this virus back. You're appropriating a very high risk of this virus now spreading within our borders (Whether it's the UK, US, etc) when we bring back these aide workers to treat them in modern facilities. You kind of hold the ruthless (not necessarily 'bad') view that they are simply reaping what they sowed. It was their choice to expose themselves to the danger, and we shouldn't be morally guilted to assume this greater risk of treating them domestically.\n\nSo my challenge to this view is that we're living in an increasingly globalized world. We are less able to make distinctions of borders and \"first vs third world\" each and every day. When considering the implications of a dangerous pathogen in a third world nation without the resources to fight it off, it'll spread like wildfire. \n\nTherefore, the argument is that sending aide workers attempts to contain the virus at its source. Prevent it from spreading. Since it is blood-borne the mechanism of infection is at least a degree preventable with the proper precautions. Therefore, it is an acceptable risk to bring them back and treat at home. Their survival increases, and if they survive, they have an immunity towards it. It'll make them that much more effective in providing aide in those regions (if they're still willing). Since I'd wager not many individuals would willingly go to those regions as volunteer aides, they are a precious resource. Without them, the infection is unchecked and we'd more likely have \"Thomas Duncan\" incidents around the world at greater frequencies. But when you consider the controversy this posed in the US a few months ago, one Dallas hospital screwed up royally. Did it spread in Houston still? No. And what about the Emory Hospital, and that other one, who's name escapes me right now, they treated them without a single new employee becoming infected. \n\nIt is an acceptable risk because of the low chance of spreading.

We could build an AI which could become sentient and destroy humanity.\n\n2. If an AI makes the \"decision\" to destroy humanity, then it will be able to act independently of human control and oversight.\n\n3. An AI which can destroy humanity AND sustain itself could utilize the Earth's resources to leave the planet.\n\n4. An AI which can destroy humanity AND sustain itself AND leave the planet will have the \"knowledge\"/progamming to avoid disaster in space.\n\nI add that last part because you seem to be under the impression that if an AI leaves this world, it will \"last forever.\" This means it would have to be able to survive meteors, comets, stars, other planets, and pretty much all matter in the universe (unless this AI could also detect which matter in the universe could be damaging to it).\n\nAll of those are MAJOR assumptions which rely on \"science fiction\" more than science. There's no reason to buy into any single one of those assumptions, let alone all of them (and ALL of those assumptions are needed for your vision to come to fruition).\n\nBut the biggest question we have to ask is \"Is this a good thing?\"\n\nAssuming all of those four things, what benefit does this give to humanity? While it is true that the biological \"point\" of any species is to survive and reproduce to carry on the species as long as possible, there are two things to consider.\n\nBut why is making a robot/AI which can function and last forever a good thing for humanity? If we assume that the human race will one day end (a very likely assumption, which is another assumption you make, or else making an eternal AI wouldn't matter), then who does it benefit to make an AI? Especially one which can destroy us?\n\nI guess your point relies on this:\n\n&gt; I think it's the only way for us to leave a trace forever\n\nWhy should we leave a trace forever? In a million millenia after the last human dies, what benefit does it give us as an extinct species that we made an AI (or multiple AIs) that will last forever?

We also have plausible methods for terraforming Mars and Venus, are working to \"fix\" Earth's climate change problem and are taking our topographical manipulation to a deliberate level, which may include restoring extinct species and engineering new species as soon as we better understand how they interact and to keep them from becoming invasive, and are working on creating AI as a tool to such complex calculations.\n\nAI and quantum computing might be a tool in computing some of those extreme levels of figures and factors, predicting X-factors, and even forecasting weather and oceanic currents and things formerly considered incalculable with current tooling. You would worship that tool, because it's potentially lethal and requires responsibility in its construction and application, and seems permanent.\n\nIn the ancient world and today, a big problem that folks struggled with was idolatry. They'd make something with their hands, like a stone or wood figure, and worship their work as god. If you'd like to get some taste of how odious that is, see how people treat the Quran, Bible, and the Torah--literature that's called perfect, superhuman, and worthy of veneration beyond the authors, transmitters, and readers.\n\nWood carving, stone cutting, metal working, and literature were once all very revolutionary tools, all surpassing the lives of their makers. This is why people worshipped what they made in their arrogance and stupidity.\n\nThe next leap technologically is AI, and you wish to worship this new tool because it's \"better\" and more \"permanent\" than us in your estimation? Typical of accomplishment worship, as you don't even let the AI tell you if it should replace you, you don't even wait to consult the very system you claim is on the higher tier of perfection. Before its even made you christen it perfect and worship it and forfeit all life to it in your mind. A little too preemptively proud of AI, aren't we?\n\nA teaspoon of petrol has about the energy of one man-day of labor. It's why you're not working in a field with an ox today (beasts of burden were also used as tools, and were worshiped accordingly). Petrol is why you have the time and resources to write what you do, the time to learn to be literate during childhood instead of growing food and scraping by. How would you feel about oil worship, people who decided that it has the right to change the climate because it can, because it's more powerful than us, knows better; and besides, the effect it has on the Earth will far surpass anything we could ever achieve.\n\nOf course you can see the flaw in oil worship: The worshipers are really just patting themselves on the back and declaring their god the end-all be-all, and form a sort of suicide pact for mankind to go down with oil and never move on. Part of suicide pacts is so nobody ever moves on, and so that whatever has been accomplished is all that's ever accomplished, and those who did it are immortalized. Think of it like tagging. It's a form of human vandalism.\n\nThere is something far beyond AI, and we'll be the ones to find it. If you're done with life and exploring and are satisfied when you look on AI to say, \"This is it.\" that's fine. Many people have worshiped themselves vicariously throguh rocks, cows, books, personalities, governments, and things they were very impressed with themselves for creating, even unto death.\n\nHowever you wont find explorers among those ranks, because those who create understand the things that they've made, and tend not to worship them.\n\nWorship of another's work is the product of ignorance, and the worship of your own work is hubris.

Humans are pretty outlier-y when it comes to animals. While it's true that most animals went extinct, humans have several advantages that makes them a non-central example of \"animals that might go extinct\":\n\n* Humans are aware of extinction as a possibility\n* Humans can impact their environment in a greater scope (on pretty much every level) than any other animal on earth ever.\n* Humans have both the resources and creativity to deal with (natural) extinction events.\n* Humans are both capable and willing of going to other planets.\n\n&gt; I think the main goal for the human race is to preserve itself, or at least leave a trace.\n\nWhat's the value of leaving a trace? Even by human standards it's meaningless since there'll never be any humans to see that trace. We don't know if aliens will even appreciate things created by human standards. (There's precedent: Sumerian art/literature is hard to appreciate for modern humans.) Having all humans go extinct but leaving a trace literally adds no value to the universe.\n\n&gt; If an AI could wipe us, it would mean that it could sustain itself and so it could easily leave earth.\n\nWhile this statement is true, the \"if...then...\" doesn't necessarily follow. Being able to able to wipe out humanity is only very weak evidence for other capabilities.\n\n&gt; I think it's the only way for us to leave a trace forever.\n\nSo is shooting stuff in space (like the Voyager Plaque).\n\n&gt; The robots population we created long ago would grow in space and explore maybe where the human race couldn't survive for long.\n\nSo? What value does that add for humans or other sapient species? What purpose would the exploration of AI have? Why would the AI even want to explore? Also, humans can't survive in a lot of places right now. If we can build AGI we can probably also change our bodies to survive more places.\n\nThose aren't my main arguments, however. The biggest reason I disagree with your view is this: If we create an AI that wipes out humanity (meaning it has values that aren't compatible with ours), you haven't created humanity's legacy. Humanity's legacy would mean human values would propagate throughout the universe. An AI wiping out all humans is the antithesis of this. On top of that, if the AI wipes out all humans, it'll probably wipe out all other life in the universe as well.  Creating an AI like that would mean love, war, happiness, boredom, art... will never exist ever again. That is not, can not and should not be the legacy of humanity."}, {"id": "2r8lzu", "body": "Assuming that one day we will create an AI way too powerful to control it (big assumption I know) and thus taking control over us (in a Terminator or Matrix way), I think even knowing that we should continue.\n\nHumanity won't last for long, we are weak, like every other species in the past we will eventually disappear.

"}, {"id": "cndz0s6", "body": "For Superman it is primarily for two reasons. \n\n1. He doesn't see himself as Superman he sees himself as Clark. Just as you see yourself as a human being and not the job you fulfil, you're not a Doctor or an Accountant, a Janitor or an Artist, those are all *parts* of you but to say that is all that you are would lessen yourself as a person and sacrifice so much of your personality. In the same way Superman is just a persona that Clark puts on so that he doesn't get crap at home for doing what he loves i.e saving/inspiring people. So asking him to choose one or the other is impossible since they're both key to his psyche. It would be the same if you asked a volunteer worker to choose between their volunteer work and the rest of their life, they can't pick. Yes maintaining a duel identity is difficult, stressful and lead to disaster, but for these people if it means that they can get the best of both worlds than it's worth it. \n\nAnd you might say that this is a selfish decision, since every second Clark isn't being Superman is another death he could have stopped. But this leads me to my second point, which is that being Clark keeps Superman in touch with humanity. We have seen many times in the comics that by forcing himself to go through the stresses of living an everyday life Superman gains a greater appreciation of the people that he saves and feels more in touch with humanity, which is difficult considering how alien he is. If he is Superman 24/7 this connection weakens and sometimes even dies (see comics like Superman: Red Son or Kingdom Come for examples) which leads Superman to start making the wrong decisions as his moral compass goes astray, he starts thinking less like a nice guy and more like a god. \n\nPlus even if he was Superman 24/7 he still wouldn't be able to save everyone, and what's worse he would still be able to hear them die, without the support of his family and friends to fall back on he would either break or harden his heart to the cries of millions. By staying Clark he stays sane, and is a better Superman because of it. \n\nThat's why his secret identity is important, because as much as the world needs Superman, Superman needs Clark.

In essence Bruce Wayne is an identity that Batman must maintain for practical purposes.\n\nSuperman is more fun and here is why (though they have messed this up a bit in newer iterations). There is no Superman there is only Clark Kent. Superman is the mask that Clark Kent wears to fight crime and use his powers. For all of Superman's godlike might He is just a farm boy from Kansas. That is why he is so incorruptible, he isn't a super powered alien god posing as a mild mannered reporter, he is a farm raised mild mannered reporter who happens to have superpowers. Clark would sooner give up Superman than Clark... he is Clark, he just dresses up like superman to save the world.

And when you live in a small country bigger countries effectively control your policies. In the case of lebanon it is done directly through buying politicians. This is true for Saudi arabia the united states Iran etc... Yet we lebanese can't have any effect on the policies of these countries.\n\nGoing beyond lebanon, I think that globally big powerful countries act as a world government. they control much of what happens in the world. they just don't agree with each other.\n\nOn the other  hand people are mostly the same throughout the world. they have some minor cultural differences, but these are disappearing more and more. Here in Lebanon a lot of people have started speaking english as a first language. In dubai it is even more common. People watch american movies in china. Even terrorists are wearing blue jeans.\n\nWe the peoples of the world have become a global culture. Today the country barriers are mostly beneficial to stop labor from going from the poor countries to the rich. But I am not sure that this has the economic benefit that the rich countries think that it has. The movement of people can bring with it jobs and expand economies.\n\nI think that most people now accept democracy. i think that religion is a barrier, but not so much and in a world goverment no single religion will be able to rule. While everyone will agree on a language most likely english.\n\nTherefore I am a globalist. I think that in the future, I don't know when people will look back on us and consider nationalism as a form of racism.\n\nAlso there won't be a war in israel and palestine if the world is one.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
