For proof, try to find me a game where gamepad-users compete on the same level as mouse-and-keyboard users, or even a game where the multiplayer segment is not segregated. FFS, consoles have *auto-aim*, and have had them for years, because you simply can't aim precisely with a joystick, regardless of where and how it's positioned.\n\nYes the objective accuracy is certainly lower. I'm talking about overall gameplay experience, the subjective fun factor. In my view, gaming with a gamepad is more FUN (up to a certain level of required accuracy which is rarely reached.)\n\nI played through all of BioShock Infinite and Portal 2 with a 360 pad and there were only a couple of sections where I grabbed the mouse instead. I was glad to have a choice, mind you.\n\n&gt;I mean, assuming you're sitting at a computer right now, you haven't replaced your mouse with a joystick, have you?\n\nNo, because I need to accurately click tiny things very often. This is not true in modern FPSs except for the rare Quake and Unreal types.\n\n&gt;I'll ignore the \"way more comfortable\", but in what way is CoD either story-based or stealthy? The single player was never more than, what, 6 hours long.\n\nIt mostly consists of hiding behind cover, following AI teammates, and watching scripted events. It's actually very rare that you're put into a wide open area with many hostiles who need to be quickly and accurately dispatched to stay alive. It does happen, but it's not the focus.\n\n&gt;And that, apparently, is such a huge advantage that FPS gamers the world over are throwing away their mice in favor of... oh wait, no, that literally never happened. Why would you need infinitely many direction to walk in anyway, you can only shoot forwards...\n\nPeople who are dedicated enough to call themselves \"FPS gamers\", no. Typical gamers don't seem to have any problem though, console shooters are selling in insane quantities."}, {"id": "cn7y8rl", "body": "&gt;I played through all of BioShock Infinite and Portal 2 with a 360 pad and there were only a couple of sections where I grabbed the mouse instead.

Or basically any multiplayer FPS.\n\n&gt;It does happen, but it's not the focus.\n\nThe *entire* single-player campaign isn't the focus, that was my point. The single player is a tiny, minuscule part of the CoD series, in every iteration a one-sitting farce. We're talking about multiplayer, the single player isn't even worth discussing.\n\n&gt;Typical gamers don't seem to have any problem though, console shooters are selling in insane quantities.\n\n\"Typical gamers\" don't have a problem with absolutely anything, as time has shown again and again, even within the CoD series. You could sell them baked horseshit an they'd buy it for $60 dollars, every year, but that doesn't make it apple pie. The examples for this are endless, I'm sure you can find your own.\n\nAs to why console shooters are selling in insane quantities, it's pretty obvious: you can play them sitting on a couch in the living room. That doesn't make the gamepad the better input device by any objective measure, or the console the better platform. The reason they're popular is the same reason that, if left unchecked, reddit - or any site, for that matter - is overrun by low-effort image posts and the like: lack of effort."}, {"id": "cn7vvsw", "body": "First off, Medal of Honor, Halo and many others predate CoD by quite a while.

This is only true in fast-paced twitch shooters- Quake and Unreal. Games that consist mainly of constant gunfire and frequent headshots.\n\nAnything slower- anything story based or with regular stealth elements and so on- is way more comfortable with a gamepad.\n\nAlso keyboard control has the fatal problem of lacking analogue movement. You can only move at one speed (or two, by holding or not holding a separate key) in four or eight cardinal directions. With an analogue stick you can move at 16,384 speeds in... I'm not even sure how to calculate the number of directions."}, {"id": "cn7wvhk", "body": "There's not really any point in my reply here, seeing as you're just stating your opinions about gamepads, but well... that's just like, your opinion, man. \n\nI've been playing through Borderlands 2 and some CoD with a friend on his XBox and in both cases I wouldn't hesitate for a *second* to say that using a joystick to control and FPS is totally subpar and absolute garbage.

It was not the first, in fact Cod 1, 2 and 3(COD 2 is my favorite of the entire series) had none of the elements and were just traditional WW1 and WW2 FPS games. COD 4 was the first one to introduce these elements in any meaningful way, and it was already late to the party, games like Battlefield 2 had already done that, more than 2 years prior. \n\nCod 4 was just the first Triple A shooter to hit consoles with this mechanic. The mechanic was already popularized by the Battlefield series at this point though, they were not breaking any ground here in fact they were just following the trends like the series had been it's entire life and still does to this day.\n\nThe one thing I will agree with is how every shooter after COD 4 went the same route largely because of the ridiculous amount of money COD 4 made.

Sure, the basic concept is the same: run around and shoot people. But when you break it down, it's completely different.\n\nLook at Battlefield 4. If you try to play that game like somebody plays CoD, you're going to have a very bad time. It's far more realistic, you're a part of a team and if you don't hold your own, you're not going to do well. In CoD, there's absolutely no teamwork element, aside from helping each other take a base in domination or doing something similar in one of the other game modes.\n\nLook at Halo. While I didn't play much of the newer ones, the same is true as with Battlefield 4. The style of play is entirely different. While Halo is more similar to CoD in that you're running around and shooting people, you have things like shields to worry about, plus guns that do wildly different things. Sure, the overall concept of \"run around and shoot the other team\" is similar among shooters, but they aren't exactly the same.\n\nIf I want to play a shooter and feel like I'm fighting in a war, I play Battlefield. If I want to listen to music and mindlessly shoot enemies, I play Call of Duty. If I want to be a space soldier, using lasers and shit and being an overall badass, I play Halo.

With absolutely anything, there will always be things that people that aren't a fan of. Make major changes and instead of Person A hating the series and Person B loving it, now Person A loves it and Person B hates it. You're entirely in your right to feel that CoD is overrated, and personally it seems futile to change this view. You like what you like. I can only provide objective points to maybe calibrate your perspective.\n\nSo back to numbers don't lie. Consider the goal the creators of CoD have. To make money. And they consistently perform this goal well year after year. Now, you're an executive of Activision-Blizzard. Why would you tell the developers to do a complete 180 on the series, \"for change's sake.\"? You only run risk and very little reward. If you stick to the tried and true model they've had, you're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. I'm sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula. \n\nReally, your view of \"overrated and overhyped\" is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own *personal* threshold for formulaic video games. But this view is separate from the objective success of the series. If they keep selling games, it means people still enjoy the series for what it is. The idiom, \"Don't fix what isn't broken\" comes to mind. There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche, hackneyed, etc. I mean, be realistic here, if they promised the most radically new CoD next year, would you buy it? Probably not. You have a bias against the series. Why would their target audience be the people who *don't* like CoD? It makes no sense.\n\nThe other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive. Making an entirely new engine is costly, takes years to develop, and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release. It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code, which drastically reduces the time (and therefore cost) it takes to make a new game. Brand new engine CoDs likely wouldn't make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it. They aren't a charity, so gamers aren't entitled to it. "}, {"id": "cn7vnk2", "body": "There are two points that you are leaning on that need to be address:\n\n1. You are equating popularity to quality. When you state \"the numbers don't lie\" you are saying that this is a popular product and therefore a quality product. In today's world most mass produced products are never good in a qualitative sense, unless the goal of the product is to be qualitatively good on a mass produced scale. Mass production typically doesn't lend itself to \"good.\" The franchises that are mass produced (Call of Duty, Assassins Creed, sports franchises, etc) are made cheaply and don't show much innovations between iterations. You need to look throughout a franchise to see major changes, and even then typically you don't see much differentiation. In the broad sense of quality videogames this is usually a bad sign, which is why OP contending the popular choice because he see's the flaws of the mass produced product as out weighing the benefits.\n\n2. You, and typically a capitalist society as a whole, think that a good product is a product that makes money. If you look at Call of Duty as a product to make money than it is an amazing product. However, through the history of art--and lets be honest here, video games can be art--most products of creativity that push the boundaries of their medium and try to capture an essence that we consider art typically don't make money. This is the problem of AAA video games: How can you justify spending millions of dollars on an artistic/\"good\" product that may not make back its money? I guess it comes down to not expecting AAA games to produce something other than what is going to hit the biggest target audience, and when they do hit the right balance between originality/artistic free expression and money making--like The Last of Us did-- than all the better.\n\nAlso, I have to disagree with your point about OP's view on '\"overrated and overhyped\" being nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of his own personal threshold for formulaic videogames' because if we start restricting personal experiences for a medium that lives in personal experiences then we might as well not be talking about videogames. By looking at CoD as an experience and then grading that experience by objectively looking at the delivery method then comparing it back onto the franchise you will get a experience that hasn't changed in a decade, hell McDonald's  has changed more than CoD in that time. To those people who are tired of that experience than yes, Call of Duty is overrated and overhyped because they are bored with the franchise.

It did a lot of things correct, it wouldn't have sold that good otherwise."}, {"id": "2qmstv", "body": "I'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right, though they are extremely overhyped. One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors. There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same. Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.\n\nAnother reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre. There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Large team battles of capture and holding points. [...] This core gameplay (conquest + linear single player) is pretty much the same from game to game. \n\nYou then said the same thing for CoD but replaced conquest with TDM, and by that formula Quake and Unreal are CoD-clones (or vice versa). The mere fact that the most popular (by no means only) *game mode* (read: objective) in Battlefield has remained the same over the years is no more indicative of the iterations being same-y than it is indication that all driving games are the same. *It's asinine*. \n\n&gt;BF went through two different engines, each with several iterations. CoD went through three different engines. The same engine has been used for the last several games, but what does it matter?\n\nMaybe you ought to read a little deeper than a single sentence on wikipedia. The first two of those three engines, the Quake 3 engine [I've been saying Unreal until now, my bad] and the [Treyarch NGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch_NGL) were only used in *two games*. They were replaced, *in 2005*, by the [IW engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IW_engine). It is, at this point, a **decade** old, and it shows, and it is of course still just an updated version of the original id Tech 3. \n\n&gt;Destructible environments have been around for a while before BF. They're hardly original there.\n\nThe point is it was a serious change and improvement for the BF series, not that they came up with the idea. Same with the weather, the leveling, commander mode, player-controlled arty, hell, the inclusion of a *story*...\n\n&gt;And I'm sure the weapons in BF were soooo different from each other. Seriously. In nearly every FPS a pistol is a pistol, a rifle is a rifle, shotgun a shotgun, MG an MG, etc. Their function hardly changes. The key point here is that they're historically different, with different features and quirks.\n\nAgain, the point being that different looking weapons aren't what differentiate two game eras. When BF went Vietnam, they included music you could play from vehicles so you could gun down VC from your Huey (another thing they introduced that was completely new: helicopters) while blasting \"Fortunate Son\". When BF went future, they included floating ships (with a new game mode to go with) and mech suits you could drive/walk around in.

It's obvious that the games are designed with multiplayer in mind, and then a single-player campaign is shoehorned in afterwards (hence why they're so short).

If you change a franchise from its core then it's no longer a [Franchise] title anymore. So the reason it's ok for CoD to not change the mechanics is because if it did, it would no longer be a CoD game.\n\nAnd the main point I'm pushing is that there is a middle ground between changing the core and changing *nothing*, and it is very well illustrated in the BF series (3-4 being unfortunately a bit same-y, but the next one going in a completely new direction - unfortunately, but commendably). The CoD series, by contrast, is a very good illustration of utter stagnation, which wouldn't be so much of an issue if they didn't release one every bloody year.

Large team battles of capture and holding points. [...] This core gameplay (conquest + linear single player) is pretty much the same from game to game. \n\nYou then said the same thing for CoD but replaced conquest with TDM, and by that formula Quake and Unreal are CoD-clones (or vice versa). The mere fact that the most popular (by no means only) *game mode* (read: objective) in Battlefield has remained the same over the years is no more indicative of the iterations being same-y than it is indication that all driving games are the same. *It's asinine*. \n\n&gt;BF went through two different engines, each with several iterations. CoD went through three different engines. The same engine has been used for the last several games, but what does it matter?\n\nMaybe you ought to read a little deeper than a single sentence on wikipedia. The first two of those three engines, the Quake 3 engine [I've been saying Unreal until now, my bad] and the [Treyarch NGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch_NGL) were only used in *two games*. They were replaced, *in 2005*, by the [IW engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IW_engine). It is, at this point, a **decade** old, and it shows, and it is of course still just an updated version of the original id Tech 3. \n\n&gt;Destructible environments have been around for a while before BF. They're hardly original there.\n\nThe point is it was a serious change and improvement for the BF series, not that they came up with the idea. Same with the weather, the leveling, commander mode, player-controlled arty, hell, the inclusion of a *story*...\n\n&gt;And I'm sure the weapons in BF were soooo different from each other. Seriously. In nearly every FPS a pistol is a pistol, a rifle is a rifle, shotgun a shotgun, MG an MG, etc. Their function hardly changes. The key point here is that they're historically different, with different features and quirks.\n\nAgain, the point being that different looking weapons aren't what differentiate two game eras. When BF went Vietnam, they included music you could play from vehicles so you could gun down VC from your Huey (another thing they introduced that was completely new: helicopters) while blasting \"Fortunate Son\". When BF went future, they included floating ships (with a new game mode to go with) and mech suits you could drive/walk around in. When they went contemporary, they introduced the commander, with UAVs, scanning, and so forth, not to mention a then-topical and fresh setting.\n\nWhat has CoD done?

It's tweaked enough to be fresh, but similar enough that you know exactly what you're getting.

This is perfectly acceptable.  You can either keep CoD going until Bro Sixpack gets sick of it, or you maintain your integrity and *abondon* CoD for something else.

What's substantially changed since the 4th game that can be compared to, say, the change between Civ IV and V, or GTA:SA and IV, or even BF2 and Bad Company?\n\n&gt;Ok, so they changed the music and they changed the vehicles?\n\nGo play Vietnam and get back to me, what I'm talking about is not \"changing the music\". And besides, BF:Vietnam was to 1942 what WaW was to 4, basically an expansion pack/mod, done by a different studio, and in both these cases the change was excellent.

I think we ought to have higher standards than either a venture capitalist or Bro Sixpack.\n\nI sense deep undertones of \"it's making money, that means it's fine\" in your argument, so you might as well just flat-out say you're gonna argue that the quality of a franchise should be judged on how much money it makes, in which case you've basically just spent 30 minutes arguing that \"Sims 3: Katy Perry Stuff Pack\" is the way to go.

It's no longer CoD. \n\nSo to you only the sidescroller Mario games are worthy of the Mario title because the 3D Mario \"is no longer Mario\"?\n\nAgain, you keep pulling this strawman out, trying to make it seem like I'm trying to turn CoD into a racing game or something, when all I'm asking for is a little bit more than new maps, a new game mode, and a new 6-hour campaign for $60 *every year*. This is the level of innovation one used to expect from a *patch* or at most a mod, not a brand-spanking new release... Take a risk, for god's sake, go proper future, change the art style, do what Bad Company did and make it tongue-in-cheek, expand to 300-player battles, I don't know..."}, {"id": "cn7t0xe", "body": "&gt;You'll always have people who criticize new releases for either being to similar to games of past or get criticized for being so different that it's no longer a true member of the franchise.\n\nOther than  maybe 3 and 4, this doesn't apply to the Battlefield series at all... They've spanned all sorts of time periods, have changed engines several times, each time pushing the envelope, have changed the single player experience around several times, introduced entirely new multiplayer gameplay concepts, like game modes, squad play, VoIP, commander mode, etc. They've even shamelessly lifted things straight from the CoD franchise like (what are essentially) perks and weapon skins. If there's one thing you can't say about that series is that it's stagnant, whereas Activision has been releasing re-skins of CoD:4 for years now. Hell, they didn't even bother to really re-do the engine for what, 4 iterations?\n\nThe differences between successive iteration of Call Of Duty are like the differences between CounterStrike iterations, except there are only 4 CS games, not a dozen, and they all got updated graphics."}, {"id": "cn7xeti", "body": "I want to say that a lot of talk about engines that goes on in public is marketing. The majority of the people in general have absolutely no idea what an engine really is and what effect it has. For example, if you were to ask someone randomly what's better about Frostbite 3 over Frostbite 2, it's unlikely they could give you any good answer beyond \"it's newer and better\".\n\nThat's not the problem however, as you can't expect everyone to study the differences. The thing is that most games actually go through engine changes all the time, but it doesn't get rebranded as a completely new version to the public.\n\nThis means CoD's engine is most likely different with every release, possibily significantly different in technical ways, but we wouldn't really know unless they tell us, which they probably won't because they are not very interested in advertising their engine (most likely because they don't license it to anyone whatsoever).\n"}, {"id": "cn7j3o0", "body": "I think it's almost fair to say that every AAA franchise these days is overhyped in some way.  That's just the nature of the business right now.\n\n&gt; One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.\n\nThis is a classic problem with nearly every long lived franchise.  How do you make a successor while maintaining the formula of the franchise and at the same time making enough changes such that it's not a rehash of previous titles?  Every single modern franchise has this issue;  BF, Civilization, Total War, Borderlands, Halo etc.  You'll always have people who criticize new releases for either being to similar to games of past or get criticized for being so different that it's no longer a true member of the franchise.  \n\nSo for CoD, rather than making radical changes to the new titles and risk straying from the current format they stick with a tried and true formula.  IMO, it's not such a bad thing for those who like the franchise.  People know what to expect from a CoD title and that's ok.\n\n&gt; Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.\n\nThe FPS genre is pretty stagnant at the moment.  BF, Halo and CoD are all pretty much set in their formulas...so it's not really fair to complain that CoD isn't bringing anything new to the field while everyone else is also not doing much to innovate.  Also, as mentioned above I think this is ok...right now you can go out and buy any CoD game and you get exactly what you'd expect.  If you start an aggressive cycle of bringing new feature sets to the franchise then you run the risk of abandoning your fanbase and straying from the formula that people have come to expect.\n\nIt's a tough problem to solve and appease everyone.

But there are tons of people that do, and that's why the series marches on. If you look at the sales, it's not over-hyped or overrated at all - it's exactly as famous as you'd expect from this kind of money printer.\n\nIf your view essentially is that the series is bad, well, I don't disagree, but there is no chance of Changing Your View^^TM because that's something so subjective it can't really be made to change."}, {"id": "cn7l4n3", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cn7lpbn", "body": "&gt; its current success is based on the success of its previous games\n\nIs this not true of every single franchise in existence?

BF would not be successful today if the originals were crap.  If you want to start a successful franchise and your first games suck then you're pretty much dead...no new games will be developed.\n\nCoD has established a proven formula, and people seem to enjoy it.  Why should CoD change it's formula if it's proven and it works?\n\n&gt; It is nothing revolutionary, though its sales figures suggest that it is. This is why I think the series is overrated.\n\nDoes every new game have to revolutionize the industry or the genre?  When CoD first came out it set the precedent, and I would consider it to be the top of its genre today.  So what more does it need to prove?\n\nSales figures support that CoD has a winning formula, but not that it's revolutionary.

The game was way beyond COD1, and the game play really felt novel and interesting at the time. Keep in mind this was back in 2006 or so, so it was a different time, but seeing how this was just when the 360/ps3 launched, it felt very novel. And then COD4 did a lot that was relatively unprecedented at the time too. Sure, we had counter strike on PC, but this game brought with it a much more accessible military game palatable to millions of people.\n\nIs it stale now after 11 games? Sure. Even with AW, I dont feel like the series is really any different. AW really does just feel like a mishmash of MW3, Black Ops 2, and Ghosts with jet packs and lasers after all. But the problem is, the games haven't really evolved much since 2005-2007 when they actually were relatively novel. \n\nSo yeah, you have a point, COD more or less releases the same game every year with slight differences and it kind of feels stale and beaten to death. But the series used to actually be very novel and interesting. I think it started to go downhill around the time MW2 came out, and it's been going down since then. I was almost gonna skip AW this year, but between jet packs and lasers and the good reviews it was getting (relative to ghosts) I decided to give it a shot. i don't regret it (i do regret getting ghosts), it is fun, and a major improvement over ghosts, but yeah, it even AW doesnt do enough to differentiate itself from previous CODs, and in a lot of ways, I think titanfall (a similar kind of game) quite frankly blows it away.

The gameplay is repetive and what really changes from edition to editon is environment, weapons and vehicles.   Maybe some graphics improvements.  Very rarely some definitive gameplay improvements.  This means that for the most part, them continually getting 80-90% ratings by critics is unwarranted, when a new game property will seldom reach this level of acceptance or praise.\n\nWhere I disagree with you, however is the notion that they are over-hyped.  They are hyped as much as is expected for a \"blockbuster\" game.  Same can be said for a movies.  Take Iron Man 3: a good movie, but by many accounts not the best in the series.  If it was a new movie property, it would haven't seen the level of hype it received.  But since it was the latest Marvel / Disney movie, the hype was off the charts.

Well not that's it's overrated, but why it has so much hype and is dominating the console scene. Obviously my answer would be too long here but external factors (other games basically) played a huge role in the rise of CoD and it had proven to be the best FPS shooter when it needed to be. And then everyone just kind of bandwagoned along and CoD had given everyone just enough to stay on the game, and when people stay, their friends stay. \n\nIs it the \"best console game\"? No, if EVERYONE gave reviews after a month of playing every game CoD wouldn't have a T10 rating (opinion). This isn't really answering your question because it sounds like I'm taking your side so I'll finish with this: Where is our bar for an FPS shooter and what games have surpassed this bar in areas that CoD hasn't?

Fast forward 15 years and the latest Tomb Raider is more like an escape from a military compound where you're basically running from one fight to the next (I gave up half way through). \n\nThere are occasional games like Skyrim that I still enjoy, but whenever I think about getting a PS4 or Xbox One I look at the games and the games packages and it's basically fighting, football, driving, fighting, pimping, football, more fighting, and a bit more fighting.

It's either A) They changed too little, so it's the same game again, or B) They changed too much, so it's a completely different game, or C) They changed the right things, kept the right things the same, etc., to justify me buying again and again. \n\nI fall into C.  I've been buying them every year since CoD2 on the 360.   There are 3 major reason I buy them, and a few minor reasons.  \n\nFirst of all, I don't have friends to play on line with.  My girlfriend loves to play couch co-op, so that's worth $60 right there. \n\nSecond, I basically get 3 games in one.  Campaign, Multiplayer, and co-op arcade/zombies.  I play all 3 as well.  So I definitely get my money's worth.  \n\nThe big reason?  Multiplayer.  I love multiplayer.  I loved the addition of crossbows, customizable scorestreaks and perks.  For every shitty, match, I get 5 great matches that I did pretty well in.  I get to try new weapons, tactics, etc.  It keeps me coming back. \n\nI truly believe they change enough around to get the games every year.  I might be slowing down on that due to Ghosts sucking, but I still got a bit of enjoyment from that one. \n\nHow about your second point?  They don't do anything different.  They why is it such a record breaking game?  Why do people play it more than any other shooter?  Medal of Honor tried to be the same, but apparently CoD did it better. \n\nBattlefield(which is amazing in it's own right) tried to introduce the unlocks and levelling up system alongside CoD.  It didn't fail, but CoD did it better. \n\nCoD campaigns have engrossed me, shocked me, and got my blood pumping for years.  CoD zombies plays better than Left 4 Dead(then again so does Killing Floor), Dead Island, and other zombie games.  It keeps you coming back. \n\nDon't even get me started on MP.  I've put as much time into CoD MP as I have in single player games like Oblivion, Skyrim, Terraria, Borderlands 1+2, Battlefield, and Pokemon combined.  That's a lot. \n\nIf you want to believe CoD is the same old game over and over, and other games do it better, then by all means.  Bu I think you're wrong. \n\nNow let's talk Halo.  I can't do shit in Halo.  I die 17 times before I can even tell what the fuck is going on.  Every goddamn game is the same.  They look the same, feel the same, play the same.  I only play Halo splitscreen now because the series went to shit.  If you put Halo in the title, then I agree 100%\n\n"}, {"id": "2qmstv", "body": "I'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right, though they are extremely overhyped.

I have, over the last little while, gone from feeling that essentially unregulated and uncensored activity on the internet is a good thing, to believing the opposite. Here are my reasons, though not in a particularly lucid or well-structured form. Also, I understand that the gap between principle and practicality is vast, so I offer my points only as ethical ones.\n\nLibel: Essentially the internet is a publishing platform. If a newspaper or other media outlet has to obey the laws of libel and defamation, should an individual who is publishing things publicly not have to do the same? As an example, earlier I read a comment in a thread about Ted Nugent. The comment made a fairly strong statement regarding his sexual preferences. If this was on TV or in a newspaper, the outlet would be in seriously dodgy territory. In this case, an anonymous person can say anything and gets to live by different rules, despite the intention being to publish their view for worldwide public consumption. I think this is wrong.\n\nData protection: Despite the above, I think companies should be extremely limited regarding what data they are allowed to store about people. The fact that millions of lines of code in various places churn through my online activity and that Google, Amazon, etc. have a virtual model of me should not be allowed. For example, Amazon should not be allowed to record the history of what I browse. I see this as akin to having a shop assistant follow you round a store with a camcorder as you browse and believe that companies who do this should be heavily prosecuted.\n\nPiracy: I understand that the issue of piracy is a complex one, but I feel that a growing attitude treats all information in digital form as almost a right. I think this is wrong, and that all copyright laws should be equal regardless of whether someone sells fake DVDs from their car boot, or runs a torrenting site. I believe that Google should not list any sits that link to illegal copyright infringement, and that they are complicit in the violations of law.\n\nNow, I understand that there are a great deal of complicated parts of this, especially when it comes to things like expressing dissident political views, government surveillance, etc. and I know how ill-formed my point is. I suppose that by offering these views for criticism and rebuttal I want help clarifying what I truly think.\n\nTLDR: Unregulated, anonymous activity that is largely without personal consequence is not a good thing. People should be as liable for what they do online as if they did it on TV or in the middle of the street. \n\nEdit 1: let me be explicit in saying that I am not claiming innocence of any of these things, but that recently I have been asking myself ethical questions and an uncomfortable with answers I find myself giving, and my beliefs are changing because of it.\n\nEdit 2: I have to go out for the rest of the night, but I will reply tomorrow and give more thought to all points made.

For this hypothetical, imagine copyright laws don't exist. If you made music, you could play in your house and so long as no one can hear it outside, it's your music on your property and you have control over who can come in your house and listen to it, if they can bring recording devices etc., but if you played in public, you lose all of those rights. You don't get to tell people in public that they can't record, you don't get to tell people that they have to leave a public area because you don't want them to hear your music etc. It's a public area, you chose to play your music there and you have to accept everything that comes with that.\n\nCopyright laws in this sense are supposed to give a musician like yourself incentive to create music without fear of having it ripped off and losing your ability to make a living off the music you worked to create. This doesn't mean that a copyright law should give you the option to play in public and kick people out if you don't want them to hear you play, because that would be giving you too much control over others, but it could mean that certain recordings etc. you would have control over. All of this is only to the extent that it is required to keep you and others like you producing content and allowing you to make money off your work, but it is not supposed to give you 100% complete total control over your product in all facets of life, if it did, it would mean you could control when someone listens to your music, in what places they could listen to it etc., which would be completely ridiculous. \n\nBut the public (ostensibly represented by the government that passes these copyright laws) doesn't have to give you these protections at all, they would just have to accept that you might not ever want to play your music or spend time developing your craft and the public would lose out on any potential works you may have created. That would be a sad world though, so the public wants you to create things and will concede certain things to give you what it takes to create music. Copyright laws have been heavily co-opted by the gigantic media companies who have lobbied governments to increase these protections well beyond what is actually required to keep people creating. Some things can be copyrighted for well over a hundred years, and by that time they may lobby for longer copyright durations. This is counter intuitive to why the public would have given out copyright concessions in the first place. The creator is sometimes no longer even alive while their work is still being monetized by a different copyright holder. So how does this benefit the public? Why should the public allow these companies to basically monopolize the intellectual property market and then mark up the prices ridiculously? Why should a country who always gets intellectual property releases months after the US actually pass any copyright laws at all? They don't have to, if it were an important enough point they could actually make it a negotiating move.\n\nFrom a general business perspective, the US and I'm very sure pretty much all other developed nations do this as well, most of these governments make businesses agree to certain terms to conduct business. You can't just make a business and then say that you get to do whatever you want. No, if you want to run a business, you have to serve everyone, you can't deny service to black people or to women etc., that's discrimination and the public has decided that it shouldn't be allowed. There's all kinds of things like that that we do to businesses, and we could do the same thing with copyright law. \n\nThe thing with intellectual property is that it doesn't have the same kind of constraints physical property has. You can reproduce intellectual property at phenomenal rates for basically no additional costs. I don't see how the public benefits from letting companies abuse this to make billions of dollars for something that they barely have to do any work to distribute to everyone. It's a hell of a lot different than a car manufacturer that has to have lots of infrastructure and lots of manpower etc. to make enough products for everyone and because of that, they can't make nearly as much profit as intellectual property sales can. No matter what they will always have certain fixed costs that scale up with production, but making a song costs only an initial cost of money and the costs of reproducing/distributing does not scale nearly as much as physical property does. Therefore it's not really fair to even consider giving it the same kind of protections physical property has."}, {"id": "cn7mghd", "body": "&gt; 3 I understand that this is true, but I don't see how anyone can easily rationalise the idea of disobeying this law.

I've personally grown up downloading things that I didn't own very often. I didn't rationalize it by saying I had a right to them, but I did rationalize it by saying that it didn't hurt anyone. My views have advanced on this, I do recognize possibilities for financial harm and I do recognize just the mindset of believing that it doesn't have harm is actually contributing to financial loss. \n\nHow I used to see it was that I'd never watch X anyways if I had to pay for it, and I'd never play Y game if I had to pay for it, and even now, I'd probably say it was true when only looking at each specific case. I'm sure you've heard a lot of people use that reasoning before, and the problem I had in overcoming this was that people who argued against it had the poorest of arguments. It probably reinforced me more in my thoughts. Always the same classical argument where it was \"not yours\", \"illegal\", \"copyright owner didn't give you permission\", so on and so forth, but in my mind, I knew I never would have bought them so those arguments were just plain wrong. I could easily prove wrong the arguments that each download is a lost sale because I could download 1000 movies which would easily cost such a large amount of money that I could prove I don't have, that it's not a lost sale.\n\nWhat I eventually thought about though was why would I not buy them? The answer was \"I'd do something else\", but what would I do? Well, maybe I could do something else for a bit, but the reason I had no problem saying that is because enough of my free time was taken up by watching movies/playing games that I didn't pay for that I took for granted the time I spent and entertainment they gave me. Sure, when I have watched a ton of movies and played a lot of games, not watching any one of those movies or games in particular is really not a problem. It's true, I could easily have gone without watching or playing one of them if I had to pay for it and I likely would have. But if I applied that to all of them all of the time, I would soon find that I'd have more time than I knew what to do with and the value of the entertainment that they provide would rise to the point where I may have been more willing to pay for them. The value of entertainment, for me at least though I'd strongly suspect it's the same for many others as well, is correlated with the time you have and the way you spend the rest of your time. If you don't get enough entertainment/stimulation with your time, then they offer more value. The more entertainment/stimulation you get, the less value they represent to your overall time.\n\nI fit somewhere borderline on it. I don't think it's morally right to get free intellectual property, you don't deserve to get anything for free just because it exists, but I don't think it's always morally wrong either but it has to be stated carefully for people who will abuse that like I once did with that poor mentality of not looking at the big picture. Overall I'd say if you can afford to buy something you probably should, but I have a problem promoting this idea too much because I think copyright law has been ruined by corporations lobbying and getting way more control than they ever should have. Imagine if they could have sold CDs that could detect what room of the house you are in and they would have sold a \"Living room Beatles CD\" or \"Dining room Beatles CD\" etc., people would find that disgusting and a flagrant misuse of copyright to extort more money from people, but they can and they do limit what devices we can use our content on and people rationalize it by saying if you don't like it don't pay for it. The point is that it's just egregiously wrong.\n\nIt sounds like the content of the book you are talking about would align quite well with robotics and automation. That's an extremely interesting and extremely complex future theory crafting, because in my view it's going to challenge all of our current notions of earning and property ownership etc. What seems most likely to me is that the rich and powerful will have to find ways to slowly transition everyone else to a situation in which not enough people are too unhappy to do anything about it but eventually the population would dwindle.

But if I applied that to all of them all of the time, I would soon find that I'd have more time than I knew what to do with and the value of the entertainment that they provide would rise to the point where I may have been more willing to pay for them. The value of entertainment, for me at least though I'd strongly suspect it's the same for many others as well, is correlated with the time you have and the way you spend the rest of your time. If you don't get enough entertainment/stimulation with your time, then they offer more value. The more entertainment/stimulation you get, the less value they represent to your overall time.\n\nI fit somewhere borderline on it. I don't think it's morally right to get free intellectual property, you don't deserve to get anything for free just because it exists, but I don't think it's always morally wrong either but it has to be stated carefully for people who will abuse that like I once did with that poor mentality of not looking at the big picture. Overall I'd say if you can afford to buy something you probably should, but I have a problem promoting this idea too much because I think copyright law has been ruined by corporations lobbying and getting way more control than they ever should have. Imagine if they could have sold CDs that could detect what room of the house you are in and they would have sold a \"Living room Beatles CD\" or \"Dining room Beatles CD\" etc., people would find that disgusting and a flagrant misuse of copyright to extort more money from people, but they can and they do limit what devices we can use our content on and people rationalize it by saying if you don't like it don't pay for it. The point is that it's just egregiously wrong.\n\nIt sounds like the content of the book you are talking about would align quite well with robotics and automation. That's an extremely interesting and extremely complex future theory crafting, because in my view it's going to challenge all of our current notions of earning and property ownership etc. What seems most likely to me is that the rich and powerful will have to find ways to slowly transition everyone else to a situation in which not enough people are too unhappy to do anything about it but eventually the population would dwindle. It isn't in their interest to allow the public to become to aggravated that they're willing to overturn the whole system, willing to challenge the notions of earning and property ownership etc."}, {"id": "cn9m7jf", "body": "Yeah, I think I am just exploring these ideas in an adult way or the first time, which is fairly shameful because I'm old enough to have done it a long time ago.

I think that what lies at the essence of my point is that, despite all the problems with profiteering, etc. it feels so strange that people (I am not excluding myself here) are so willing to rationalise piracy, which feels ethically wrong if you value the principles of it. I know it is not the same as theft, and I know that some laws have been corrupted by corporate influence, but it feels so questionable to me that there seems to be an attitude that, if something can be digitised, then you have a right to view it on your computer because you've paid for your internet connection.\n\nFrom another perspective, it concerns me that lots of infrastructures are dismantling. I have been reading Jaron Lanier's book Who Owns The Future? It got me wondering about lots of these questions, and wondering if digital technologies are helping or harming society as a whole despite their obvious benefits to individuals. He specifically mentions the recorded music industry at one point; there used to be recording technicians, people working in factories that produced physical media, people to transport that physical media, people working in the shop that sold it, etc. All of that was funded by sales of physical media. That is all evaporating. I know the tide can't be turned back, I know that digital distribution has its advantages. I know that we can easily get into saying that I am arguing against progress, and that there's a reason we don't have blacksmiths, etc. but something about the way the world is changing is making me uneasy so I am asking myself these questions and am probably just pining for the \"old ways\".\n\nThanks for taking the time to write such a detailed response.

It created cheaper food, and cheaper food meant people could spend their leftover money on more products, which created demand for more production in the manufacturing industry.\n\nLater, mass production made many of *those* jobs redundant in turn, but that just meant cheaper products, more spending money, which people spent on more human services. \n\nAll that crap that your house is filled with, has been made possible by industries trying to more efficiently produce stuff with less workers, that need less payment.  \n\nEvery cent that a music publisher spares on transportation, is a cent that they can spend on hiring more employees in other sectors.

Constitution has a copyright clause, is because without it, putting entertainment or new behind a paywall through copyrights, would be as illegal as randomly censoring any other text from being printed by all but one person.  \n\nAt least on a conceptual level, forbidding the public to print Bibles and limiting it to the Catholic Church, and forbidding the public to print The Hunger Games and limiting it to Suzanne Collins, is the same type of government action. The latter's relative frivolity is irrelevant, after all free speech doesn't just apply to important speech. The latter's younger age, and the cultural benefit that result from authors profiting from copyrights, is a practical justification for why it was *a good kind* of restricting free speech away from it.  *I'm not saying that copyright is evil*, or well, I'm saying that it was a necessry evil, a practical limitation of a right for expected greater benefits.\n\nThis conceptual collusion was irrelevant for centuries. 99% of people had no reason to care that their hypothetical right to print The Iliad isn't applied to the latest Charles Dickens book, because they didn't have a printing press, they bought both from the book store anyways, it was irrelevant what arrangements printers made among each other about the flow of profits. And for the remaining 1%, it was a benefical arrangement, with them getting more control,  they were the priviliged side of the regulation. They were the only ones who ever had any interest in caring how long the copyright terms should last, or how Fair Use should be defined. \n\nBut on the internet, we write and share our texts every day, and link to others', we play videos, we edit them, and re-upload remixes. We sing songs, we play songs while playing games and upload that video together, we share pictures, and draw, and we download, and stream, and copypaste, and quote, and cite. \n\nSuddenly, it's very clear how the \"1s and 0s\" of a privately \"owned\" content are similar to the 1s and 0s of any other data that we communicate with each other every day just as we breath and walk. What used to be the obscure regulatory laws of an industry, are now felt as a restriction on our daily usage of our most basic tools.

Which is an interesting distinction ethically, because limiting these facets of the internet will not eliminate these problems, they will simply put them away from public limelight. I'll address each point as you do:\n\nLibel: Your stance that the internet is a publishing platform is one interpretation of many. Others can simply view it as a communication tool. When you have a discussion with a friend or a colleague in your living room, you're not \"publishing\" your views on a topic to them. You're having a conversation. The internet could simply be seen as a means of having this conversation thousands of miles apart, as opposed to the proximity of your immediate surrounding space. You could argue that it is both a publishing platform and a communicating tool. That would account for the difference in, say, news sites vs forums. You can keep your stance that *published* material follows certain standards to avoid libel under the law, this is limited to companies or individuals who operate under a public entity, such as a newspaper or a media outlet online. But forums are largely where \"individuals\" on the web congregate, and this would be no different to speaking to people in your living room, it's just a larger crowd. You, at a social gathering for work, can talk smack about Sally in HR who is a total bitch and it's not considered libel. It gets kind of murky when you say a person can't talk in forums in similar manners. Even reddit isn't \"worldwide public consumption.\" reddit has it's own population, target audience, and is a fraction of the total world population. Where do you draw the line between friends in your living room, a group of like-minded forum posters, etc? \n\nData Protection: I think people personify the idea of \"virtual model of myself\" when it comes to these online algorithms. Like it's some white collar office jockey who personally browses through your online shopping history and makes his own suggestions, or like you said, some retail clerk who follows you around as you shop in person, then making suggestions. The reality is that it just boils down to a math equation. They're just cross referencing what other people bought as well and make the assumption it has value and immediate need/want as well. Another human being likely has never seen your purchase history. It's just attempting to make your shopping more efficient. And when I look at some of its suggestions, they're completely off. Their \"virtual model\" of me isn't \"me\", it's merely a generalized guess. To make a Fight Club joke here, \"I am not my shopping history.\" Maybe a reasoned middle ground is that individuals should have the choice to have these algorithms applied to their shopping? Make it extremely transparent and prompt them from the beginning, rather than require them to understand that's likely hidden in some distant settings on their account?\n\nPiracy: Well, are you more interested in enforcing the illegality of obtaining copyrighted material? Having Google link to them can store the \"paper trail\", so to speak, of an individual's online presence, which can be used to prosecute or penalize them more efficiently and accurately. By simply not linking to them will not reduce piracy, it will only move it back to communities, such as the \"invite-only\" Demonoid-type community. Maybe it'll make it harder for the layperson to find this material, but again, it won't really address the issue, it'll just hide it from public sight.

Laws such as the Digital Economy Act provide for disconnecting whole families from the internet without due process because someone in the vicinity is accused of watching TV the wrong way. That would be bad enough, if the internet were merely a conduit for delivering entertainment products. But the internet is a lifeline for families, and giving some offshore entertainment companies the right to take it away because they suspect you of doing them wrong is like giving Brita the power to turn off your family's water if they think you've been abusing your filter; like giving KitchenAid the power to take away your home's mains power if they think you've been using your mixer in an unapproved way.\n\n&gt;The internet is the best \u2013 and often the only \u2013 place to publish all sorts of information, and yet England's high court judges have decided that the entertainment industry can compile blacklists of sites they don't like and get court orders demanding that service providers block them without a hearing, much less a trial. \n\n&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/mar/28/copyright-wars-internet?CMP=twt_fd \n\n(recommended to read the rest of it, it's good stuff.)\n\nIt's a fact of modern life, that the same Internet, (and often the same websites), that serve as our main publishing platform and DVD distributor, also happen to be platforms of our our most intimate discourse, of a billion vital practical utilities,  and securing civil liberties. You can't regulate all facebook posts as news articles, and all Google links as cable channels, because there are billions of them, mingled with our entirely innocent, (and often vital) means of communication. \n\nEven now, these supposedly too lax laws regularly lead to hobbyist artists' Fair Use creative works being censored away from the net through DMCA takedowns without due trial, or people losing their private data because it was on a file storage system that apparently didn't take down pirated files agressively enough. Corporations like Google can choose between these two options: censoring innocents with agressive takedown systems, or getting censored for being too slow. The third option would be to supervise all data transmission manually, that would take millions of employees and drive them to bankrupcy.  \n\nYou say you care about the principle, not practicality, but when practically executing your principles is physically impossible, and attempting to do so involves casually demolishing much more important principles, then your principle sucks. \n\nUltimately, libel laws and copyright laws were written because they made sense at the time. It's not just that the theory behind them could have been phrased to sound vaguely fair, but their results **were evidently fair**. When spreading news was in the hands of a handful of journalists, then a handful of unintrusive regulations that limited very few people in very minor ways, could have a great net social benefit. \n\nLikewise, when a handful of factories could mass prduce books, casettes, CDs, etc., then it made sense to give printing monopolies over individual works to their authors, to maximalize their profits. \n\n But when everyone has a printing press in their pocket, insisting on upholding the same benefits at the price of breaking our civilization's nervous system, messing with large numbers of innocents, just for the sake of keeping the status quo and protecting a few relatively trivial special interests, exactly that kind of balanced fairness is sacrificed on the altar of \"Following the Principle\". \n"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2qmhw7", "body": "Let me make this clear before I continue, I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.

Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.\n\nWhenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.

I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.  \n\nSo reddit, why do people post nudes?  I seriously can't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT:  Thank you for all of the replies!

We simply enjoyed the evening in a natural way. Once I asked another guest what he would do when a co-worker would enter the room. \u201cI\u2019d greet him friendly,\u201d he said. That\u2019s it!

And while I don't have the proof, I'm willing to bet that those same 8% would have improved just as much if they decided to commit to a goal at any other point in the year.\n\nHere's why I believe New Year's Resolutions are almost always destined to fail. Every NYR requires:\n\n**1. Wait until the new year starts.**\n\nThis absurdity alone should put this to bed. There's no rhyme or reason to wait until the arbitrary beginning of a calendar system to start something. I believe most people simply want that last week before their resolution comes into \"effect\" to gorge on unhealthy food while they still can, smoke cigarettes while they can, etc. Then:\n\n**2. The second the New Year starts, your life is supposed to automatically change forever.**\n\nThe second the clock strikes 12, that's it. No more cigarettes, no more junk food. Ever. Why? Why introduce such a drastic change on a whim like that? What is the reasoning? Why not make steady improvements over time instead of unleashing hell on yourself all at once? And people think this is going to be successful?\n\n**3. If you \"fall off the wagon\" you have failed. There's no second chances.**\n\nIf your last cigarette wasn't at 11:59 PM on December 31, and you smoke anytime thereafter, you have failed your resolution. People treat NYR's as a do-or-die effort. If you don't go to the gym, if you ever touch another Dorito, or you buy an unnecessary item at the mall, even once, that's it. You have failed at achieving your NYR and you may as well give up. It's such a ridiculous mindset. If you set an arbitrary date to make a drastic lifestyle change, you are going to fuck up! It's ok! There's no reason to beat yourself up over it. Yet most people fail before February and completely give up their NYR thereafter.\n\nHumans are simply not hard-wired for such massive changes in diet, nutrition, lifestyle, etc., to be taken all at once like that. And there's no good reason for it either. It's a completely arbitrary date, with nothing magical about it whatsoever, and there's absolutely no reason not to change your life at any other point during the year. In fact, if you really wanted to, you already would have. You wouldn't be waiting for the new year. And then when you inevitably fail, you blame yourself and become even more discouraged. No wonder.

Just the fact that people come around and ask the question, \"what's your new year's resolution?\", causes you to look at yourself.

Once the holidays are over, many people take that time to undo the damage of the stres by starting to improve themselves. Starting earlier would just be an additional stress that most people don't want/need at that time of year. \n\nYes, the 1st is a *little* arbitrary, but there's some good symbolism about starting fresh, just like the calendar.

You have an important date that you can't forget.\n\n&gt;I believe most people simply want that last week before their resolution comes into \"effect\" to gorge on unhealthy food while they still can, smoke cigarettes while they can, etc. \n\nSee my point about stress.

The system itself has to take care of that; that part of the equation is not up to you.\n\nc}  No lust for result.  Once the resolution is consciously made, it must be put out of your conscious mind; because if you keep thinking about it, you will attempt to mentally enforce the method by which your result will come, which again will result in failure.\n\nSomething else that needs to be said about enduring stereotypes in general, is that the only reason why they ***are***, is because they are at least ***partially*** effective.

A lot of people set themselves up for failure when they create New Year's Resolutions. They choose resolutions that are too difficult, too sudden, or too absolute. By creating an ultimatum to change their lives instantly at an arbitrary moment, they set themselves up for failure. Yes, many, perhaps most, resolutions are doomed to failure.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that all resolutions have to be that way. The truth is that major life changes are hard, and they, as you observed, don't necessarily align themselves with the new year. Major lifestyle changes take planning, commitment, and sacrifice, so if you want to make a major resolution, you have to be willing to put all of those in. Most people don't have that kind of resolve, but that doesn't mean you can't.\n\nSo think of a resolution you want to make. Do you have it? Are you sure? Are you ready to sacrifice to make it happen? Good. Your sacrifice starts right now.\n\nYour first step when venturing out into the unknown is to find a guide. One of the many reason resolutions fail is because people have no idea what they're doing. Take a look over at r/Fitness and the like, and you'll find plenty of people gearing up in horror for when the noobs come in mass later this week. If you've never lifted weights seriously, then you don't know what you're doing. If you've never lost weight successfully, then you don't know what you're doing. If you've never quit smoking, then you don't know what you're doing. People fail because they have unreasonable expectations, bad routines, or outlandish goals. Find some people online who have some idea what they're talking about. If you're ready, a more personal guide, whether it's a personal trainer, a therapist, or a resolution buddy, can also help.\n\nThe next step, now that you have some knowledge on the subject is to set a reasonable goal. You are doomed to failure if your goal can't be completed. A good goal is measurable, specific, reasonable, and time-constrained ([Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)).\n\nFinally, you need to plan on how to achieve the goal. Will you gradually reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke, or will you switch 100% to gum. Will you get a fitbit and gradually increase your step count, or focus first on changing your diet. Don't try to do too much at once, or you'll do everything halfway. Take small steps every week, and leave plenty of time to fall off the bandwagon and recuperate.\n\nSo, are many resolutions doomed to failure? Yes. Are many resolutions stupid? Yes. But the failure is with the methodology, not the idea. Your resolutions can be a success. You just need to really want them."}, {"id": "2qlhq0", "body": "We hear it time and time again every new year. Our closest friends and families making new years resolutions.

Roughly 30% of the country has Internet access (although only a third of those get it in their homes through wifi or cable, most go down to the local Internet cafe, or perhaps one member of the family has a smartphone). Part of the country is under rebel control. \n\nLet's imagine a scenario here: lets say there was a child pornographer who was uploading the content in rebel territory. He works in a very remote region, from a single computer (the only one with Internet access for 200km in every direction). Because he is in rebel territory, you can't simply go and arrest him and the rebels support him. If you were somehow able to cut off his Internet access and prevent him from uploading the child pornography, which he sells to fund the rebels who are fighting for the right to keep slaves and marry pre-pubescent children or something really awful, you're saying you *ought* not to do so, in the strongest moral terms, because to do so would be to fail to respect his status as an autonomous human being."}, {"id": "cn79mq6", "body": "It should be a starting assumption that all rights are contingent, and are only meant to apply to certain populations in certain situations.

We don't say \"oh well it's too hard to insure people have free speech so we're just not going to have that as a human right.\" This discussion does not include how we would go about insuring or protecting that right, it pertains only to the idea that internet (or at least access to it) should be a fundamental human right.\n\nThe internet is (I contend) one of the greatest developments in the history of humanity. It represents a singularity event whereby the amount of information to a single person is greater than could be consumed in whole lifetimes and a platform for an open exchange of information that is unrivaled in the history of humanity.\n\nAnything in the world you can think to want to learn, you can through the internet. Culture from any time and place, as well as the tools to participate and create modern culture on your own, can be found online. It's probably the single greatest tool for personal education that a person has available to them.\n\nI realize this sounds very breathlessly idealistic but I think most of us tend to forget what an amazing thing we have access to when we spend all day looking at cat gifs. \n\nWith that in mind, denying people access to it or censoring it is, in my view, a violation of what should be considered a fundamental human right in the same way we consider an education to be a human right. We should protect the greatest asset to human learning and communication that ever was in the same way we protect school as a right.\n\nTo the inevitable [Avenue Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJvdGcb7Fs) fans, only about [4-5%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/julieruvolo/2011/09/07/how-much-of-the-internet-is-actually-for-porn/) of the internet is for porn.

This is a longer answer, so bear with me.  :)\n\n&gt; Suppose we have a tractor and a team of oxen. Both can be used to plow fields, pull wagons or do other things around the farm. Clearly, the tractor out-performs the oxen in every task. Still, there ought to be some area in which the oxen don\u2019t perform quite so badly relative to the tractor. Maybe the tractor is a little less efficient at plowing smaller fields since it has to make many turns. Or maybe fuel for the tractor is much more expensive in some regions, and so the oxen ought, in those cases, to have some sort of comparative advantage. So why have oxen been completely put out of work in developed countries like the United States?\n\nBecause oxen aren't sentient or intelligent.  Oxen are better looked at as a technology themselves, not as anything comparable to humans.  Tractor/oxen is akin to DVD player/VHS player.  It isn't relevant for discussions of comparative advantage.\n\n&gt; It seems to me that there are two reasons. First, there is the magnitude of the absolute advantage that the tractor has.\n\nWell... no.  The entire point of talking about comparative advantage is talking about the gains from specialization, but oxen *can't specialize because they aren't smart enough*.  They are, essentially, a technology.  They only perform one task, just like the tractor.  Yes, when the things you're comparing only perform one task, absolute advantage is what's necessary.  This entire diatribe is not even relevant to discussions of comparative advantage.\n\n&gt; The second reason is, perhaps, even more important: tractors, being machines, can be replicated on demand. If we imagine that a shortage of tractors existed, then comparative advantage would work. The available tractors would be deployed in their most productive uses, and the remaining work might well go to the oxen. But, in reality, the farmer can acquire as many tractors as he needs to do all his work, and in fact, he has no choice but to do so in order to remain competitive with other farmers.\n\nWhat?  Tractors are a scarce resource.  Farmers buy as many tractors as it's financially feasible to buy.  Is he pretending that tractors are a magical resource that can simply be duplicated on demand?  \"As many as he needs to do his work\" isn't a real measurement, because the farmer's \"work\" is limited by market forces.  This is a strange example.\n\n&gt; As another example, suppose you are a brain surgeon who is also an excellent cook. Now, you might choose to employ a cook who is not quite as good as you are because doing so would free up your time and energy to do more brain surgery. So comparative advantage works there. But suppose you develop a machine (or two machines) with a dramatic absolute advantage in both cooking and brain surgery. Then, you could replicate your machine, and pretty soon there would be no jobs for cooks or brain surgeons.\n\nWell, this example is approaching sanity, so let's go through this one.\n\nFirst, it's worth pointing out that robots exist primarily to supplement human labor rather than to replace it, so the example is a little silly as I can't imagine us ever just putting a human who needs brain surgery in a room with a robot, and then taking a smoke break.  But we'll skip right by that.\n\nPeople never seem to realize that robots (assuming we can treat all automating technologies as monolithic) are a scarce resource.  Even today, think about all of the jobs that have been automated, but that humans still do.  CGP Grey is fond of talking about Baxter.  Well, Baxter is here, now.  Why hasn't he replaced baristas already?\n\nBack to the brain surgeon example, any robot would be expensive and an employer wouldn't be able to buy as many as he'd want.  Would he buy a robot to cook, or to perform brain surgery?\n\nLet's say the robot is a little bit better at brain surgery than any person is, but a lot better at cooking.  Presumably, robots would then be deployed to cook, because the marginal increase in brain surgery skill wouldn't be worth the huge increase in cooking abilities.\n\nFlipping it around, if the robots were a dramatic improvement in the brain surgery field, but a tiny improvement in cooking, the robots would perform brain surgery.\n\nLet's say robots are way, way better than humans in both fields, but slightly better than humans at cooking.  We would *still* expect to see the robots cooking, rather than doing brain surgery.\n\nThe key to remember is that *every robot deployed as a cook is a robot that isn't deployed as a brain surgeon*.  This is true unless robots are magic, meaning they aren't scarce in any sense of the word and are not subject to laws of supply and demand.\n\nAlso, this entire point is dependent on robots with easily transferable skills that are better than humans at every task.  I would argue that this isn't even a feasible scenario, but the point is that robots won't displace human labor *even in the worst case scenario*."}, {"id": "cn77tos", "body": "I'd bet 50 bucks this author couldn't describe comparative advantage if he tried.

If automation didn't lead to mass unemployment then, when could it ever? "}, {"id": "cn72bmy", "body": "In an ideal world, yes, this would be the case. However, the nature of the capitalistic system means this would never happen (or at least happen on a smaller scale). The realities of the matter are that those that control the means of production would benefit, while those at the jobs lost to automation would lose, simply by the nature of supply and demand.\n\nHow would this happen? Imagine if 10% of the labor force was made 80% obselete by the invention of a new technology, say the self driving car (the transportation industry). Lets say some of the 10% remain in the industry, trying to find the 20% of jobs that weren't made obselete. Under your theory, these 20% of jobs would simply hire the remaining workers, and make them work less hours each. But this isn't what would happen. In fact, the opposite would happen. Because of the influx of unemployed workers looking for jobs, the competition for the job increases. Some workers are willing to work longer hours, or for less pay, and those workers get the jobs. The businesses arent operating on charity, after all. Why pay 10,000 workers a full time salary, each working 2 hours a day when you can pay 2000 workers to work 10 hours a day?\nMany workers (the ones that dont immediately retire) will have to look for new work, and fast. Because of this, they flood the job market of the jobs that aren't automated. Some get an education, and move up to white collar jobs, while others become retail workers or busboys etc. This influx of workers into the labor market now raises the supply of labor. Because of this increase of supply, the same thing happens to other markets. Wages as a whole go down/hours worked go up (if neither are possible because of government intervention, then the people simply remain unemployed). \n\nSo if automation is so bad, who benefits? Not the workers being replaced, thats for sure. The benefits are split by:\n\nA. The workers who aren't being pushed out by automation. These workers get cheaper prices on all the products that are now being automated and can be sold for cheap prices.\n\n\nB. The employers who automated the workers, because they now can make more profit while cutting prices too!\n\nThe problem arises, you see, when more people are losing than gaining. Depending on the split of the benefits between A and B, this can occur at any rate of employment loss due to automation. The scenario desrcibed, and one that I personally believe will happen, is a scenario where MANY jobs are lost to automation that aren't replaced. \n\nIn this scenario, the number isn't 10%, or 15%, but 30%+. When 30% of workers will do anything for a job (including white collar, educated workers), employers who employ can take their pick of the litter, so to speak. Why take an employee who's willing to work 10 hours, or 12 hours? Why not take one that will work 15? The thing is, people will be willing to work 15 hours, because they need to feed their family and competition for jobs is so, so high. \n\nAt this point, we either undergo an economic revolution (to a form of socialism, where the automation is controlled by the government) or we continue working enormous hours for little pay. The revolution would most likely be extremely bloody and possibly unsuccessful, because those controlling the automation would have the technological means to quell rebellion, drones, etc. Also, they would easily be able to hire soldiers, because, again, people will do anything for a job.\n\nSorry if I'm being a negative nancy, but this is really the only way I can see it playing out.\n\nTL;DR: The control of the means of automation in the hands of the few would lead to longer hours due to more competition for work."}, {"id": "cn7abe5", "body": "&gt;Wages as a whole go down/hours worked go up\n\nDo you understand that *real* wages would go up even if nominal wages *may* decrease?

Land, fossil fuels, and clean water being finite resources, there is a natural limit to how much costs of living can be brought down (and no natural limit to how automated we can make the economy). Other significant costs are health and education, which are empirically shown to behave almost in a Veblen manner in the US.

For one, automation will not only happen more quickly than in the past, but increasingly more quickly, for two reasons: firstly, the developed world increasingly has cheap capital and expensive labor, meaning capital-intensive production is cheap and less-labor-intensive production brings more profits, and secondly, we are developing technologies faster than ever before, and we are investing to quicken the development of new technologies, which will increase the rate of automation. And sure, some jobs are more safe than others, but that doesn't negate the fact that, when people lose their jobs, they lose an income and they become competitors for jobs that still exist. \n\nStaying ahead of the tech curve is kind of a useless buzzword, since we can't really know where the tech curve is headed (we can guess, but anyone who can do it with any level of certainty will earn an unprecedented amount of money even just playing stocks). The reality is that people have to adapt to technology in real time, not 6 months in advance, but when they've actually been handed their severance notice.

The markets that took care of the German hyperinflation had some help from Hitler, too.

Generally, we can divide workers into skilled and unskilled labourers. Skilled work often requires a bigger investment in education, more practice, but results in higher pay and better job security, whereas unskilled work doesn't require very much training and is low paying and insecure. Automation threatens the latter category; if work, such as flipping burgers, taking orders, or dispensing food items can easily be done by a machine, then when it becomes cheaper to employ machines to do this work, human workers will be phased out.\n\nIn the short term, we can consider skilled labourers to therefore experience little effect in their job security or working hours due to increased automation, because their jobs are, for the most part, too specialized for robots. Academics, philosophy, art, and even dexterous skills like woodworking, brain surgery, and luxury textiles are too complex for modern robotics to perform, and it may be many factors of years before robots are advanced enough to do these tasks. What's more, as long as technology evolves faster than AI and robotics, we can safely say that there will exist some people in the labour force, and that a growing proportion will be irreplaceable by robots.\n\n&gt; I mean, isn't more free time what we all are striving for?\n\nWell this raises the question of what all those unemployed people are supposed to do with all of their time. They have no income, and they presumably have no non-labour aspirations (as noted above, they were unskilled labourers, and likely don't have academic or skilled pursuits). Labour economics deals with the issue of labour versus work. When we get an increase in pay, how much more or less do we work as a result? What are the marginal benefits to increasing our labour time? How much do we value leisure?\n\nThis last question is of importance here: does anyone value leisure so much that they would like to devote all of their time to it? In theory, the more leisure a person has, the less valuable more leisure becomes (decreasing marginal utility of leisure). In fact, many people work simply because they like to work. Some people when offered higher paying jobs refuse to take them, because the work that they do brings them satisfaction and enjoyment, and is preferred over leisure."}, {"id": "2ql0u2", "body": "Everybody is panicking that when robots and automated scripts take our jobs from us, there will be a giant socio-economic crisis.

[This long-ass passage](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-25&amp;version=NIV) from James, and [this longer one](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=NIV) from Matthew make a pretty strong case that salvation requires doing good deeds.\n\nAnyway, I'm not a believer anymore, but I'd like to hear some compelling arguments that Christianity *is* actually crystal clear on what it takes to achieve salvation.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
