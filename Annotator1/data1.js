If a job is low-skill, has a very defined set of rules to follow, and is relatively expensive for a human to perform... yeah, it'll probably get automated.  We're moving to more automated retail, data entry, driving, basic diagnostics.\n\nBut robotics and artificial intelligence is still in its infancy.

I think the name of the game here is minimizing your potential regret/loss. As someone who is supposedly at the forefront of (some subsection of) this technology, I am in no way convinced that automation is coming at such a rate that getting a job would be not be in your best interests. In any case, the cost of being wrong about this in the short term seems extremely high in terms of both immediate loss and diminishing potential future earnings/life opportunities.\n\n\nLet's assume you're correct and that all jobs are slated for potential automation within your timeline of 20 years. Manufacturing is a pretty easy target for people to claim \"automation is coming and robots are taking our jobs!\" but this is not likely to be the case for any kind of near-term timeline (for a bunch of industries, at least). Even if automation were immediately available (which it's not, because it's hard to set up and extremely hard to do in a general sense), there are a tremendous number of potential barriers to adoption. \n\n\nA big issue that is fairly ubiquitous is liability in the face of system failures. Aerospace manufacturing is a field where this is very relevant- the failure modes of flying things tend to be pretty disasterous, and we aren't quite ready as a society to trust fully or even mostly automated approaches to building them. Artisinal products, products that change design over time, or products that don't readily fall within the bounds of assembly line work are also poor candidates for automation. Further limitations are found in our ability to build dexterous manipulators. We are getting a lot better at this both in terms of hardware and software control, but we're still nowhere near achieving the manual dexterity of even a 6 year old child. \n\n\nSo even if we assume that we've solved a lot of the major, field-defining challenges inherent to the software end of this automation, the hardware has to catch up in capability while simultaneously becoming inexpensive enough to be more worthwhile than a person in the same position. Speaking of hardware, we do not have robots building robots in any remotely turn-key manner. If you're willing to bet your livelihood on the automation of all relevant jobs, you might as well help usher in this new age of post-scarcity utopia and get building!\n\n\nThere are a lot of industrial accidents that result from humans moving near robots with insufficient sensing / \"dumb\" platforms that are supposed to operate in safety cages (in isolation). Giving robots sensors to detect humans isn't enough to solve the problem. There are tons of problems in conveying intention and interpreting social signals that need to be addressed, and until we have a good generic model of human social behaviors and stimulus responses, we won't be able to autonomously develop the robot behaviors to get the desired reactions.\n\n\nEven if you don't believe me, what's the harm in playing it safe now? You improve your worst-case scenario to generating supplemental income and building a skillset that you can hopefully draw upon later for personal/social gain if not financial. If I'm wrong and the automation renders you obsolete then you're no worse off, save for the time you spent working less whatever enjoyment you derived from having income and meeting people through work. I think as long as you're conducting thought experimnets of this nature you're just as well off to imagine an automation-fueled dystopia (maybe you don't make the utopia cut?).\n\n\nTL;DR: Even if we solve the software problems, there are tons of hardware-related issues in meeting the capabilities and demand that would be required to accomplish this large-scale automation. I estimate the chance of this happening within 20 years to be very near 0%. Even if I'm wrong, you have much more to gain and stand to lose quite a lot less by getting a job now and giving it up later."}, {"id": "2rpsl8", "body": "I think the world is automating fast enough that a utopia will arise where no one will have to work anymore.

I think his speech plays a role in the hatred and fear and insane partisan climate of current right wing politics. He's not just someone I disagree with, but someone I find actively harmful.\n\nHowever, his actions are speech, and any attempt to silence him through violence would be even more abhorrent to me.\n\nIf Rush were subject to the same consistent and credible threats of violence as Charlie Hebdo, and he kept up his work because he did not want to give them power, that is an act of strength and will against an adversary who must not be bowed down to.\n\nThere have always been places in the world where people must bow to the violence of the mob. There are places where non governmental \"morality police\" patrol the streets ready to throw a teenage girl into the back of a van if they catch her wearing makeup.\n\nRight now, in this instance, and maybe in this moment in the world, much of that mob is Islamic defending their religious beliefs. In the 1930s in the US, it was often the mafia, out for material gain. In the past it has come from other beliefs, in the future it will be different yet.\n\nBut one thing is consistent. The more we bow to the mob, the more power we give it. Knowingly risking one's life by refusing to bow to this force will always be noble regardless of how frivolous or even terrible the specific action is that one is standing up for, because one will always be above all standing against the power and rule of mob violence."}, {"id": "2rpevf", "body": "Please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post.

(Which was in short supply when those religions were created in the first place) These days we know murder, rape, paedophilia, etc. is unanimously wrong.  \n\nThe reason why it's so hard to talk/debate with some religious people is because they think they're in the right because of what some human wrote down in lieu of \"God\". Some of them don't want to change while others conform to humanist/secular thinking of the modern world. (Moderate/liberal religious people) \n\nI think instead of hating people/ideas and having black and white thinking they should treat each situation as it comes because morality is totally subjective.

My grounds in that regard is it would seem that there are many provisions of Islam which are fundamentally opposed to modern liberal philosophy, mostly having to do with the treatment of women, free speech, and violence towards those who do not believe in or criticize the faith. I see a lot of people who view the religion as more peaceful (such as yourself) quote passages establishing that it is wrong to kill and the like, but I have never seen any evidence establishing these protections beyond Muslims that didn't come with a caveat (such as being forced to pay taxes for being Christian or Jewish).

If they act in a harmful way because of their religion it is ok to hate them, but if they simply identify or agree with it but do not actually conduct any actions you believe to be wrong, than it is not ok to hold any grudge against them.

Neither am I saying that God is a lie. I am saying the dictum 'One Nation Under God' is a lie. \nLet's just break that statement down into its constituent parts. First, 'One Nation'. Now, just to point out one particular property of a 'nation' - it is the sum of its constituent parts, of all its members. To say, One Nation, is to refer to all of that nation's members; is to take into account all constituent groups of that nation.\n\n'Under God'. That would be easy if it were a uniformly theistic state. It is not. According to the Pew Research Centre as of 2012, the percentage of irreligious, depending on definition, is from 15% to a full third. Even 15%, in a society as diverse as that of the US, is a significant chunk of the population, and 33% drastically more so; a third of US citizens are not religious, just under half of which *at the minimum* do not believe in a God at all. \n\nTo put those together, to say 'One Nation Under God' is to define the entire population and all its groups as being beneath a deity in whatever ambiguous form. As we have seen, that *excludes* between 3 in every 20 US citizens to *1 in 3*. That proportion of the population, according this dictum, *do not count* as being part of the nation. \"Somewhat inclusive' and 'flexible' are not good enough, it has to be completely inclusive to be true, which this statement absolutely is not. \n\n[Source](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/10/NonesOnTheRise-full.pdf)"}, {"id": "cni3hr7", "body": "While there might not be a productive reason to have those phrases around, there isn't a productive reason to get rid of them either.

I rarely drink any regular soda with calories.  In fact, I grew up with diet soda and I tend to prefer the diet soda taste to regular soda.  Because of my amount of intake, I've spent a lot of time researching all of the facets of the issue, and I've found that the studies which condemn diet soda and/or aspartame are few and far between.  This is in direct contrast to all of the literature condemning diet soda and aspartame which is *not* scholarly.  In essence, the studies tend to say it's fine and the blogs tend to say it's not.  I put infinitely more faith in scientific rigor.  Aspartame is one of the most-studied compounds on the planet, and dozens (hundreds?) of nations have given it the okay.\n\nThere is likely a correlation between obesity and diet soda drinkers, however I think it's pretty obvious that causality is mixed up, here.  I think that 1) people who are obese are more likely to drink diet soda as a \"diet\", and 2) people tend to order a diet soda along with a bunch of fast food or otherwise unhealthy food.  It's about the lifestyle which some live, not the diet soda itself.  I'm not interested in lifestyle, just the diet soda itself.\n\nSome say that it ruins your teeth, but in the studies I've read they were testing people who already had poor oral hygiene.  I think that pretty much gives it away right there.  Additionally, I may only be a sample size of one, but I've had a lot of diet soda every day for years now, and I haven't had a cavity since before puberty.  Again, it's anecdotal, but it's something.\n\nPlease give me an argument, not just a link to a study.  I've read studies linked with regards to this topic before, and there is almost always some flaw, such as a diet soda drinker who already had poor oral hygiene, the drinker already being obese, or the behavior only being shown in rats.  **I'd like something that says that otherwise healthy people become unhealthy solely because of diet soda and/or aspartame, not the lifestyle which surrounds it.**\n\nThanks!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made.

After all, it's divisible by itself. And it's also divisible by 1. The two things it needs to be divisible by just happen to be the same thing. So for this reason, there's an additional restriction: 1 is not a prime number.\n\nWhy is that? It's a completely arbitrary restriction. We just threw on a clause at the end that stated 1 isn't prime. It should be prime!

The prime factorization of 12 is 2, 2, 3 because `2 * 2 * 3 = 12`. But if we allowed 1 to be prime, then we no long have unique prime factorization.

When an environmentalist says that unnatural toxins are damaging the environment, what she means is not necessarily just that toxins are artificial, but that by producing them we are somehow upsetting the course of the universe. Similarly, when a fundamentalist says that homosexuality is \"unnatural,\" he does not just mean that it is artificial in the sense of being created by society- he means that it is somehow wrong that this is a social artifact of humanity. \n\nI think what you mean to object to is \"natural\" in this sense of the word, which is perfectly reasonable.

If the only way the product is created is in a laboratory, factory or anything resulting from human activity than it could be called \"unnatural\", or synthetic/man-made if you want to avoid the negative connotation of unnatural. Even though all transformations from the raw material to the final product must follow natural laws, it does not mean that the transformations would ever occur naturally, without human intervention. Sure you can expand the definition of natural to include these man-made products, but if you were to do that, the word natural loses its ability to describe things and differentiate between things we find and use and things we have to chemically alter or create. If this were the case you would need to describe things as \"not synthetically made\" to gain an edge over man-made products that are marketed as natural.\n\nI'll try to give an example without getting overly scientific but trans fats aren't natural, by this definition. To my knowledge trans fats rarely occur naturally, if ever. This is because when fats are formed, they arrange the elememts in a different orientation, known as cis. One way that the kther form, trans fats are formed is at high heats when the chemical bonds in the fat are broken and the alternative arrangement of bonds is formed in the trans arrangement. If i remeber correctly, one way trans fats are made is when oil is reused after frying. Obviously, no natural laws were broken when the trans fats were made so I guess you could call them natural. However this type of fat is never seen in nature, so when humans digest it, supposedly bad things happen. I think this is because it is in a form that our bodies have never seen before. For this reason I would argue that it's fair to call trans fats unnatural. If you want to change the word so it doesn't interfere with the idea that we are a part of nature call them man-made products or synthetic or something. But I feel as though in order to keep everyone informed about the food they are eating, and products they are buying, there has to be a distinction.\n\nI don't feel like all synthetic products are bad, for example polyester and polymers have changed the world, and continue to do so. Especially the ones that combine different chemicals that are never combined naturally to get the most desirable charecteristics from each separate natural chemical. There are a ton of great man-made products like teflon and other coatings. They just don't occur naturally.\n\nOne more point is that the view that everything is natural is often used to market products, many of the \"natural flavors\" in food are created synthetically. Although I'm not completely sure if the chemicals they make are found in nature, many of them probably do. But this raises another question, does it matter how we obtain the chemicals, or just if they are observed in nature when we use the word natural?\n"}, {"id": "2ro9ux", "body": "I can't remember the topic that spurred this discussion, but a friend and I were debating whether man-made things were natural.
