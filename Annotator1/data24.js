The state already gives subsidies to poor families and takes away children that aren't being properly taken care of. The only difference would be that if a pregnant woman is capable of getting a safe abortion, she would have a greater incentive to do so (as it would be the responsible thing to do)."}, {"id": "2qy21w", "body": "First of all, I understand the underlying arguments for women being the sole decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion. I also understand the underlying arguments for a man being on the hook for child support. However, I believe that these arguments clash against each other, and I feel that men should either be able to waive their financial obligations to their child, or they should partake in the decision for the woman to get an abortion.\n\n\"Women should be the decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion because they should have control of their own bodies\"\n\nThis is a perfectly valid point. In this argument, the fetus is being treated as a part of the woman's body and therefore, the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the well-being of the fetus and its future.\n\n\"Men should be on the hook for child support because we shouldn't be focused on the parents, but rather the well-being of the child\"\n\nThis also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing, the needs of the parents shouldn't be placed before the needs of the child.\n\nHowever, if we take the argument that \"women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus\", then it should also be right to say that \"men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus\".\n\nIf we take the argument that \"the well-being of the child should come before the well-being of the parents\", then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the well-being of the child's future.\n\nI find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body, but when it comes to men, their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man.\n\nTherefore, I believe that men should either have abortion rights, or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child (while abortion is still an option).\n\nNote: I'm not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing. I actually agree with the views of many feminists on paternal rights, such as the ones highlighted in [this article](http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2013/06/17/is-is-unfair-to-force-men-to-support-their-children/).

So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies? Is this something we as a society feel is an acceptable result?\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Financial abortion is completely unworkable, bad public policy, and very unlikely to be morally supported by society.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnaozch", "body": "What you are advocating for is commonly referred to as \"legal paternal surrender\" by Men's Rights Advocates, or more commonly known as \"financial abortion.\"  \n\nIt won't work; it's simply bad public policy.  \n\n---\n\nOriginally posted by /u/dude324 in [/r/TwoXChromosomes](https://i.imgur.com/HLJGE11.png) - a good analysis of the whole financial abortion argument:  \n\n\n&gt;First off, legally, child support is for the child, and most courts do not allow parents to sign away the child's rights completely.

So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies? Is this something we as a society feel is an acceptable result?\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Financial abortion is completely unworkable, bad public policy, and very unlikely to be morally supported by society.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnasgdc", "body": "We've covered this ground before, so I'll skip straight a newer point:\n\nA Missouri state senator claims that [requiring a spouse/father's permission to get an abortion should be constitutional because that spouse will eventually be forced to pay child support](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/republican-wants-women-get-permission-father-having-abortion).

So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies? Is this something we as a society feel is an acceptable result?\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Financial abortion is completely unworkable, bad public policy, and very unlikely to be morally supported by society.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnaqkxe", "body": "I have said before - you keep pasting this comment, which is full of poor arguments and misleading statements.\n\nThe entire comment is dismantled by having an opt-in system - no man can be forced to pay for a child he does not consent to."}, {"id": "cnaqkxe", "body": "I have said before - you keep pasting this comment, which is full of poor arguments and misleading statements.\n\nThe entire comment is dismantled by having an opt-in system - no man can be forced to pay for a child he does not consent to."}, {"id": "cnasmaf", "body": "What about when a woman gets knocked up without the guys consent and doesn't want daddy in the child's life but now that the kid exists he wants in.

So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies? Is this something we as a society feel is an acceptable result?\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Financial abortion is completely unworkable, bad public policy, and very unlikely to be morally supported by society.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnay66z", "body": "&gt; Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right?

Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\nI don't understand this bit, are they saying there has to be a large court preceding for the alleged fathers intention, whether or not he wants to raise and support the kid?\n\nIf that's the case, that makes no sense.  Especially considering the current system.  Legally there is no father until he signs the birth Certificate(when you consider cases out of marriage).  Why wouldn't that just stay as is, why would there need to be lengthy court issues for this.  When it's as simple as there is no paternal figure responsible for the child until they agree (or court assigned)  The guy wants to be the father, he goes wherever with the women and puts his name on the piece of paper along with hers declaring them both parents.  He doesn't want to, he doesn't sign it.\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies? Is this something we as a society feel is an acceptable result?\n\nThis is also bad logic and comes from a children are essentially burden to the state mindset.\n\nTaxpayers should take on the responsibility.   We have a stake in making sure that kid grows up healthy and well educated so they become responsible taxpaying citizens themselves.  Ideally doing better than their parents and growing the system.  Shoving the kid off on the first man they can force to support him is bad for children's mental health and puts the kid at greater risk of being a tax-burden rather than a tax-contributor.\n\nAs well as it further makes less sense when you consider the foster care system is already essentially the state paying to take care of kids so there already is a precedent of taking care of other peoples kids.  Why the state would refuse to pay support in this situations in even an hypothetical would require dissolving the entire welfare system for displaced and orphaned children.\n\nOutside of even the fostercare system, there's adoption.  If a mother who can't support the child on her own refuses to seek adoption for the childs best interest, how is it more rational or fair for the state to step in and force a sole individual to support her independent decision to keep the child?"}, {"id": "cnaozch", "body": "What you are advocating for is commonly referred to as \"legal paternal surrender\" by Men's Rights Advocates, or more commonly known as \"financial abortion.\"  \n\nIt won't work; it's simply bad public policy.  \n\n---\n\nOriginally posted by /u/dude324 in [/r/TwoXChromosomes](https://i.imgur.com/HLJGE11.png) - a good analysis of the whole financial abortion argument:  \n\n\n&gt;First off, legally, child support is for the child, and most courts do not allow parents to sign away the child's rights completely. So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right?

And the \"best-case scenario\" is still pretty bleak compared to what the actual best-case scenario would be.  Best-case scenario, a woman is in frequent contact with the father of her potential child and knows exactly who it is (possibly her boyfriend).  She then finds out she's pregnant 4 weeks after a missed period, and can immediately inform the potential father, giving her plenty of time to decide how to act.\n\nThat's, like I said, the best-case scenario.  But it's still a very likely situation that you would suspect that you're pregnant when you first miss a period, and be able to confirm it at most 6 weeks after that.  So, let's say the conception happens right after the end of your last period, you have 10 weeks in order to verify that you're pregnant.  So, that gives you a 10 week window between when you find out your pregnant and the deadline for receiving an abortion.  Still plenty of time for your partner to decide (upon being given a certain deadline, say 4 weeks) and you to decide what you're doing based on his decision.\n\nObviously, this wont account for every case.  Sometime,s there will be a situation where a man chooses to avoid contact as a way of not making this decision, or for other reasons.  But that doesn't mean that it would work for the situations where there is a window to make decisions (which would be most of them).  \n\nWomen  would be expected to know whether they're pregnant within a certain period, so there would be no incentive to avoid the doctor.

Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies?

So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks.

She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his?

Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys?

What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father?

It was not just her choice to have sex, she did not make that choice by herself, so she should not be left to her own devices to decide what to do with the child that could result from that choice.  It may not be fair to you that you would be responsible for child support should the woman choose not to have an abortion (which can be very risky) or carry the child to term and give him/her up for adoption (which is also risky and has long-term consequences on the mother).  However, it is also not fair to her to have to make that choice and risk the man just running off if he doesn't completely agree with the choice she makes.  In that respect, I do support the man being responsible for pitching in financially to help raise the child should she choose to keep it.  I also support holding a woman responsible financially should she decide not to take part in raising the child, and the father takes full custody.  It should definitely be a two-way street.\n\n*Edited to add that in the case of female-on-male rape or deceipt, if it can be proven, the man should not be required to pay for the upbringing of a child resulting from that union.  I believe that society is moving more towards equality across all genders regarding these issues, as female-on-male rape is a very real and awful occurence that should weigh just as heavily in the court systems as male-on-female rape."}, {"id": "cnauvw3", "body": "My cousin was supposedly unable to have children - shes almost 25 and numerous doctors told her she wouldn't ever be able to have kids.

So, you know, we have that legal hurdle to start with. I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with.\n\n&gt;Biology is unfair. No reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he doesn't want to pay for a baby.\n\n&gt;But MRAs make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion. They call this financial abortion sometimes.\n\n&gt;Financial abortion will not work. It is bad public policy. Here's why, in chronological order:\n\n&gt;First thing that happens is the girl finds out she's pregnant, right? On average, women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant, though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks, I believe. [EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period, not two weeks after conception. So the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant.] Remember that in most states, women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason, like medical issues, rape, or incest. In most states this is around 20 weeks. So here's our average timeline. 20 weeks, and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario.\n\n&gt;Everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair, right? She has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not.\n\n&gt;So first off, what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy? Those \"I didn't know I was pregnant scenarios\". What is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out? Women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems, since they won't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy. How do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know? Do we have full trials on this issue to decide? Who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load? Would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts (which are already overburdened and underfunded, guys).\n\n&gt;Ok, so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions, and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it, since it's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them.\n\n&gt;Our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window.\n\n&gt;Well, we kind of need to know who he is, right? What if he takes off and avoids the legal process? Does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out? What if she just says she can't find him? How do you prove which way it went? A trial? Who pays for that? What if there are a few different men who could be the father. Should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork, and if it ends up being another man's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid, even if it is not biologically his? I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's.\n\n&gt;So I imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done. Ok, sure. There is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses. It's called an amniocentesis. But it has side effects if you do it too early. Most doctors won't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy, though some do it as early as 11 weeks. Even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother, we've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks.\n\n&gt;I actually don't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test. It's the woman's body, should she have final say? What happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks? Will the guy just have a shortened window for this? What if she refuses to take it at all, as is her legal right? Should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially? If he does have a legal way to force this upon her, should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus? What courts are we going to resolve these issues in? Should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys? Who pays for the test?\n\n&gt;But lets go back to our best case scenario here, where the woman is cooperating, allowing tests, going to the doctor, we've established paternity, and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done. What now?\n\n&gt;Well we assume that the man, files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test, right? Keep in mind current court resources and funding, which I do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand. Well, the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window, which means that she has to be served with that paperwork, just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person. Who pays for service? What if the woman disappears to avoid service? That happens all the time with other civil cases. The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time. There is no way it would be done in 9 weeks. What happens in those cases? What if she has a valid excuse? Should it be a crime for her to do this? What happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service? What happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared, like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something? Does he have to pay child support? Does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault? What court system should resolve this?\n\n&gt;And finally, if everything goes right - if she cooperates, lets the dad know, goes to the doctor, if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here, we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner, and she makes an informed decision and has the baby, what happens if she needs help raising it? What happens if she's poor, or loses her job, or the kid gets sick and has major expenses?\n\n&gt;Do taxpayers now take on the financial burdens our government traditionally puts on the father? Is this a fair decision for taxpayers? How many people do you think would support this new kind of welfare? Should the government step up and take the place of the father because he \"opted out\"? Should the government refuse to pay welfare in these circumstances? Who is to blame if the child dies of starvation or something as a result of those policies? Is this something we as a society feel is an acceptable result?\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Financial abortion is completely unworkable, bad public policy, and very unlikely to be morally supported by society.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnbexji", "body": "&gt; Biology is unfair.\n\nThat is precisely why we should enact FA.

It assumes that the children deserve the right to a biological parent's money. It is an absolutely presumptive statement. I would absolutely never do that to my own child, but the idea that a child has the right to compel somebody to pay for them just because they are their own parent, is silly to me. I might get this whole abortion debate if child support had a limit, so to speak, you can only get up to a certain amount and no more just to survive (now what is fair is a completely different debate), but a child is no more entitled to their parent's money than they should be. I'm absolutely not entitled to my parents paying for college, I'm not entitled to my parents buying me gifts, there is this absolutely presumptive idea that the child deserves money just because they are separated, yet for some reason this same presumption does not exist when the family is together. I just dont get it, why is a child entitled to a certain standard of living based on income if the parents are separated, but not when they are together? \n\nI mean in a lot of senses child support also entitles the mother (or father) to a certain standard of living, same with alimony to a certain extent. It just seems like absolute entitlement to me, that because of your father's income you get X. Now, then, agree or disagree with me, I am of the opinion that because reproductive cohesion is so relatively common (9% of men and 5% of women are at risk, we dont know exact numbers of \"baby traps\" though hard to study) and I follow the common law principle of I would rather have 10 guilty/liable for child support men go free than 1 innocent be on the hook (sexually assaulted/rape victim in this, depending on what you consider lying about it means and your jurisdiction). I am all for huge raises in taxes to support this system, and for a opt in system, but my issue is that so many of these arguments for child support presume that those in favor of it presume that we dont need a culture change, we dont need a social safety net, the child has natural rights to the parent's money, parenting is an opt out rather than opt in, ect ect.

"}, {"id": "cnbx4ni", "body": "  Forcing the mother to make all the choices when it comes to having a baby with no support from the father or forcing a mother to have an abortion to not have an unplanned pregnancy is the situation you're placing mothers in. Under the idea of financial abortion, that man can break from his obligation at any time with no real cost to him. The mother can't. \n\nTwo people have sex and a pregnancy occurs. The guy signs his sheet of paper and is out and the mother is faced in a rough spot because she either has to get a medical procedure done that she might or might not be okay with from a moral perspective or she has to face the cost of having a child alone. \n\nI don't have any qualms with abortion, but there are certainly women that  do. The Catholic woman is my example would certainly have major issues with it. She wouldn't just get an abortion and be okay with it. She would get an abortion and then have months and years of regret. \n\n\nI see two people that both had a part in the creation of a pregnancy. I see one person faced with ALL the medical, financial or moral concerns. And I see the other party celebrating with his friends that he didn't have to pay thousands of dollars for a child he helped create but now doesn't have to pay for. And I see my tax burden increasing to subsidize all these children that the man is now not paying a dime for. and I have to ask why I'm subsidizing men to have consequence free sex. This isn't the same as money which could support neonatal health and thus produce healthier woman and babes. This is paying tax dollars so that man can get a woman pregnant on a Monday, sign a document on a Tuesday absolving himself out of all responsibility and then be in a pick up bar on Tuesday night. \n\nThe fact that this view basically states that I have to pay more tax dollars for men to have consequence free sex bothers me. The fact that one party is given all the responsibility and the other party is given zero, if they want to, bothers me greatly. \n\nFrom a male perspective, getting a one stand stand pregnant is a big fear. It is in the back of your head because you know if that happens there will be a consequence. Now under fin. abortion laws, there is simply no consequence from getting a woman pregnant. None. Zero. \n\n   So why should a man care?  Why should a man take any steps to prevent pregnancy because wearing a condom mean less sensation and not wearing them has no consequences from pregnancy.

Currently men **are** forced in a singular possible direction, with no other possibilities or feelings even involved.

However, I believe that these arguments clash against each other, and I feel that men should either be able to waive their financial obligations to their child, or they should partake in the decision for the woman to get an abortion.\n\n\"Women should be the decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion because they should have control of their own bodies\"\n\nThis is a perfectly valid point. In this argument, the fetus is being treated as a part of the woman's body and therefore, the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the well-being of the fetus and its future.\n\n\"Men should be on the hook for child support because we shouldn't be focused on the parents, but rather the well-being of the child\"\n\nThis also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing, the needs of the parents shouldn't be placed before the needs of the child.\n\nHowever, if we take the argument that \"women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus\", then it should also be right to say that \"men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus\".\n\nIf we take the argument that \"the well-being of the child should come before the well-being of the parents\", then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the well-being of the child's future.\n\nI find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body, but when it comes to men, their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man.\n\nTherefore, I believe that men should either have abortion rights, or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child (while abortion is still an option).\n\nNote: I'm not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing.

They feel like \"The woman has this choice that I don't have, and it's not fair\". However, this idea that MRAs and other dudes have put forth is wholly unrealistic, and oversimplifies a situation that has a lot of complicated feelings around it.\n\nFor one, what about women who are morally opposed to abortion? So you've helped to create a fetus that, to this woman, is a human life. Now you want an abortion, and the woman hears \"Kill it or else\". It also leaves aside the fact that while many women intellectually agree with abortion, they can still be incredibly emotionally conflicted when it happens to them and they have to make that choice. I've known several women who have had abortions, and some of them went ahead and got one with no issues, but a couple were absolutely devastated leading up to and after it. Luckily I've never (knock on wood) been in that position, but I honestly don't know how I would feel if I was. I dislike the treatment by these people that \"Oh abortion is easy, so just get one\". It's definitely not that simple for everyone (though it can be for some).\n\nA lot of people (not all, but you brought it up) who advocate for this solution conflate abortion rights and rights to not pay child support. They are completely and absolutely separate issues. Abortion rights are about bodily autonomy, end of. You do not right to decide what goes in and out of her vagina, for many many reasons. You can make an argument against so-called \"financial slavery\", but they are in no way related. I've even heard it said by MRAs that they should be able to force women into getting abortions, or that as long as men are expected to pay child support, then they won't support abortion rights. Abortion is a choice between a woman and her uterus, not two parents and a child. Child support is an issue regarding a child and his/her rights. Abortion is an issue regarding a woman, and her rights. You can argue that you shouldn't have to pay child support, but \"woman can get an abortion!\" is not related to your argument.\n\nIt's often proposed that women who can't abort but have an unwilling partner should just give it up for adoption. I think that for many women it's almost impossible to give away a baby that you have spent the last nine months gestating, that has literally been a part of you, and then you went through an extremely draining and painful physical process to bring into the world. It's a huge reason that mothers who have elected for adoption back out at the last minute. Most people are programmed to procreate, and pregnancy and hormones often work to indelibly bond the mother to the child she carried.\n\nAnother huge problem is logistics. What are the rules surrounding this new policy change? How much notice does the woman have to give? How large is her window? Some women don't even know they are pregnant until three or four months in. My friend didn't even know until she was almost five months, as she had no symptoms and gained maybe five pounds, which gave her a window of about two weeks to make a decision and obtain an abortion. What about cases where the dad disappears? What about cases where the dad isn't sure? What about cases where the dad says he wants it and then leaves later? What about states/places where it's extremely difficult to get an abortion? What about the idea that it's kind of coercive to tell a pregnant woman \"Do what I want or you're on your own\"? What if the dad opts out but later wants to see or have a relationship with the child? Does the woman get to deny him or ask him for 5/10/18 years of back support? And who pays for that kid if the dad won't? Do we think that society at large will be OK partially supporting a ton of kids whose sperm donors get to have nothing to do with it? What kind of new court system will have to be created to deal with these cases? Who will pay for that? What about the fact that many men (and women) already completely abandon their financial responsibilities to their kids and many face no issues because of it? \n\nWhat about the fact that by allowing men to \"opt out\", we are essentially absolving them from any and all responsibility for creating children? Women are the ones to get pregnant, so they can't escape some repercussions if conception happens. The man can now just walk away. This places even *more* burden on the woman. She is solely responsible for all things surrounding birth control and reproduction, because the man has no reason to be. Condom broke, slipped off, or maybe he just \"forgot\" to put on one? No big. Felt too good, and the guy didn't want to pull out like he said? It's cool for him, it's all on her. And birth control will still fail, but now only one party has to deal with it.\n\nAnd what about the kid? None of this is their fault, and once they're born, they have rights too. As a society we've decided that the best way to ensure (as best we can) a good outcome for the kid is to have both parents contribute to their care. Regardless of support, a lot of these kids are still going to be born.

They feel like \"The woman has this choice that I don't have, and it's not fair\". However, this idea that MRAs and other dudes have put forth is wholly unrealistic, and oversimplifies a situation that has a lot of complicated feelings around it.\n\nFor one, what about women who are morally opposed to abortion? So you've helped to create a fetus that, to this woman, is a human life. Now you want an abortion, and the woman hears \"Kill it or else\". It also leaves aside the fact that while many women intellectually agree with abortion, they can still be incredibly emotionally conflicted when it happens to them and they have to make that choice. I've known several women who have had abortions, and some of them went ahead and got one with no issues, but a couple were absolutely devastated leading up to and after it. Luckily I've never (knock on wood) been in that position, but I honestly don't know how I would feel if I was. I dislike the treatment by these people that \"Oh abortion is easy, so just get one\". It's definitely not that simple for everyone (though it can be for some).\n\nA lot of people (not all, but you brought it up) who advocate for this solution conflate abortion rights and rights to not pay child support. They are completely and absolutely separate issues. Abortion rights are about bodily autonomy, end of. You do not right to decide what goes in and out of her vagina, for many many reasons. You can make an argument against so-called \"financial slavery\", but they are in no way related. I've even heard it said by MRAs that they should be able to force women into getting abortions, or that as long as men are expected to pay child support, then they won't support abortion rights. Abortion is a choice between a woman and her uterus, not two parents and a child. Child support is an issue regarding a child and his/her rights. Abortion is an issue regarding a woman, and her rights. You can argue that you shouldn't have to pay child support, but \"woman can get an abortion!\" is not related to your argument.\n\nIt's often proposed that women who can't abort but have an unwilling partner should just give it up for adoption. I think that for many women it's almost impossible to give away a baby that you have spent the last nine months gestating, that has literally been a part of you, and then you went through an extremely draining and painful physical process to bring into the world. It's a huge reason that mothers who have elected for adoption back out at the last minute. Most people are programmed to procreate, and pregnancy and hormones often work to indelibly bond the mother to the child she carried.\n\nAnother huge problem is logistics. What are the rules surrounding this new policy change? How much notice does the woman have to give? How large is her window? Some women don't even know they are pregnant until three or four months in. My friend didn't even know until she was almost five months, as she had no symptoms and gained maybe five pounds, which gave her a window of about two weeks to make a decision and obtain an abortion. What about cases where the dad disappears? What about cases where the dad isn't sure? What about cases where the dad says he wants it and then leaves later? What about states/places where it's extremely difficult to get an abortion? What about the idea that it's kind of coercive to tell a pregnant woman \"Do what I want or you're on your own\"? What if the dad opts out but later wants to see or have a relationship with the child? Does the woman get to deny him or ask him for 5/10/18 years of back support? And who pays for that kid if the dad won't? Do we think that society at large will be OK partially supporting a ton of kids whose sperm donors get to have nothing to do with it? What kind of new court system will have to be created to deal with these cases? Who will pay for that? What about the fact that many men (and women) already completely abandon their financial responsibilities to their kids and many face no issues because of it? \n\nWhat about the fact that by allowing men to \"opt out\", we are essentially absolving them from any and all responsibility for creating children? Women are the ones to get pregnant, so they can't escape some repercussions if conception happens. The man can now just walk away. This places even *more* burden on the woman. She is solely responsible for all things surrounding birth control and reproduction, because the man has no reason to be. Condom broke, slipped off, or maybe he just \"forgot\" to put on one? No big. Felt too good, and the guy didn't want to pull out like he said? It's cool for him, it's all on her. And birth control will still fail, but now only one party has to deal with it.\n\nAnd what about the kid? None of this is their fault, and once they're born, they have rights too. As a society we've decided that the best way to ensure (as best we can) a good outcome for the kid is to have both parents contribute to their care. Regardless of support, a lot of these kids are still going to be born.

This is the thing that I think you're missing. The needs of the child outweigh most other considerations, including the fact that the parents have the rights to put them up for adoption.

Where the woman has the choice, the child does not. Where the man has a choice (in an opt-out scenario exists), the child does not.\n\nThis is my biggest concern and objection to arguments for opt-out arguments. They simply never consider anything beyond the relationship between the man and the woman. There's no consideration for the child or the ramifications for them that would result from that lack of financial support. If opting out results in a child being severely disadvantaged in life through absolutely no choice of their own, I have a massive problem with it.\n\nThat it's 'unfair' to fathers and men doesn't dismiss that the child is really the only entity involved that is completely at the mercy of everyone else without having any sort of role to play in their existence or choices.
