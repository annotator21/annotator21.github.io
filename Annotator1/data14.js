Or, are you saying that piracy is a losing battle and shouldn't be fought? If it's the latter: How do you expect creative artists / companies / groups to make money off of their art? Would you just *expect* that someone pay's for all of that...say, maybe the government? Or, maybe ALL art should be made public and thus artists should create for the public's view instead of a livable wage? \n\nRegardless, there would have to be an accountable party for said pirated work. If no one's willing to pay for it,You're starting to border on socialism, son. And, we all know how well that worked for the Soviet's....\n\n&gt;a side effect of said legislation would be the legalization of piracy which really doesn't matter because people pirate the shit out of everything legal or not.\n\nFollowing that logic, perhaps the Jewish genocide should've been legal because \"everyone's doing it legal or not\". Everyone, obviously, in this example, were the German Nazi's. \n\nRegardless, I don't see how you came to your original conclusion that redundant efforts to protect information would essentially legalize piracy. I mean, unless you're implying that security measures would be more lax and thus piracy would be easier? \n\nOr, are you saying that because information would be so freely available that there would be *no* need for piracy? That still doesn't solve the problem of intellectual property, I'm afraid :(\n\nI guess I don't understand the main thrust of this poorly constructed conclusion.

They were systematically hiding their actions from the people... who knew genocide was illegal. \n\nRegardless, it doesn't matter if he was ''trying'' to take a soft stance on theft. Completely transparent information is, at its core, piracy. \n\nThe *only* way such a system would work is if *everyone* contributed to the discovery, catalogue, amelioration and publication of such works be it through work, taxes or property donation.

Another part of the problem is there are areas in the world that dont think the way the US works is a good way. We have countries all over the world that dont play together well already and without first fixing at least some of that a world government wouldnt work as well as any decent modern country that has states or provinces or whatever they will call the individual \"states\" of their country.\n\nIm saying i dont think we with what the world is like currently are even close to being able to have a one world government, nor is any government in the world even remotely close to good enough to use as a model to run the whole world.\n\nCant argue with thinking a decent function world government is a bad idea but i do think as the world currently sits it will still be a long journey before we are even close to doing something like that. Just individual countries are to different to function well together, we fight over resources still and it would only get worse if theres a higher government throwing all resources into the smaller countries (3rd world type countries) to catch them up to the larger ones. Reason states like you said work well together is we have worked together all along (for the most part) but with countries we have so many areas and countries where there hasnt ever been peace between them for so long its a major hurdle to just expect them to suddenly be fine with working together, look at the middle east for example, wars have been waging there for so long over various religions and resources in the area, they would continue to wage as civil wars and cause a divide that wouldnt help a one world government in any possible way. Thats just one region like that and there are several like that. Why i was saying we need to at least be close to the same page as individual nations before we can merge into one giant one and that kind of thing will take a long long time to achieve, certainly not in our or even our kids lifetimes.

Countries big and small see civil wars -- with thousands of languages, cultures, religions, and other factions, how could you possibly administer such a world without constant rebellion and violence?\n\nI think you could simply have an extension of the federal/state system in the US, where the world government has laws that we feel strongly enough to call \"global\" even if some people don't like it. e.g. you might make murder and rape and theft and stuff like that illegal on a global scale, and then you have some stuff that you let countries decide the legality of (say, prostitution or drug and alcohol use or pornography or whatever it is), then if they want, like the US does, they can have finer granularity down at a state or city level.\n\n&gt; A world government is bad for the same reason that we don't like business monopolies -- we need competition so that the best ideas win and everybody else benefits.\n\nIn my opinion, a global authority which all countries are bound to obey is important because *some* problems fail when exposed to unregulated competition. This is easy to see in simple capitalism, with a failure on the low end of worker wages - if somebody is unemployed and starving, they will be willing to work for less than the poorest employed guy, rapidly driving the low end of unskilled labor to inhumane (imo) poverty levels. Because of this failure, some regulation is needed to make sure it works alright, and therefore a minimum wage is necessary to ensure that even unskilled laborers can survive. Currently, there is a problem that different countries have vastly different labor protection laws, so that companies get a benefit from outsourcing their unskilled labor to overseas, which drives people out of work here while contributing to sweatshop conditions overseas. If there were a \"global\" minimum wage and global labor protection laws, one might imagine that people like us would take a  hit to our purchasing power as phones and computers and microwaves and clothes all get more expensive, but on the plus side, poor people in third world countries would stop getting totally fucked in sweatshops.\n\nAnother problem which might fail due to competition between countries are things like global warming, where the individual countries could be seen to be participating in a tragedy of the commons or prisoner's dilemma scenario, where the \"best choice\" for *every country* in terms of not ending up with an unlivable earth, is for all of them to eat the economic hit and stop releasing so much shit into the air, but the best choice for *any individual country* (besides maybe the big players like China and the US) is to cheat, continue pumping shit into the air, and kill us all (or make the world much more expensive to fix in the future) in order to make the cost of industry in that country cheaper. e.g. if Texas laws let you happily dump poison in the rivers and oceans and poison the air (that Louisiana had to drink and breathe) while California continued trying to make the water and air better, industry would move to Texas, making Texas \"win\" and California \"lose\" in the competition. Laws which are nationally enforced are required to make both Texas and California both not poison the earth. Currently the US has laws like these, but perhaps not so much overseas, which is leading to overseas countries \"winning\" the competition for cheap industry but at the cost of poisoning themselves or the earth (which has a global affect). A global government would force all the countries to be reasonable in wrecking the planet and killing their unskilled labor, much like US labor laws make it so Oklahoma can't just decide tomorrow  to make sweatshops where people are exposed to mercury and heavy metal dust to win all over the gadget-making industry."}, {"id": "2r862l", "body": "I live in Lebanon.

So uniting the globe would likely see human development plateau.\n\nOne example is China vs. Europe.  In 1000 AD, or even 1500 AD China was superior in every conceivable metric.  Yet in a few hundred years, the squabbling Europeans not only caught up to China but passed them and humiliated them for a hundred years.\n\nThe same thing happened with the Egyptians vs. the Greeks, and many other times.\n\nIt stands to reason that since elites typically rise to power under conditions favourable to them, they will consciously and subconsciously work to maintain those conditions, and view any change as possibly destabilizing.  \n\nFor example, there were the rudiments of steam power in the ancient Mediterranean, but the entire economy and way of life was built around the institution of slavery.  Wealthy people who would have the money to invest in steam engine prototypes would also have the most to lose if their slaves were suddenly worthless.  So we didn't get steam power until labor shortages and intense competition made elites willing to experiment with them out of self-preservation.\n\nCompetition drives most innovation.  And we can debate the relative merits of a stable society vs one that is constantly in flux.  Either might be fine in isolation.  But they never are.  And even if we unite the entire world, there are worlds beyond counting in the heavens.  Surely others are home to builders and explorers like ourselves.\n\nIn the early 1400s, a Chinese Emperor built a giant fleet that explored the oceans and could have dominated the world.  But the new Emperor ordered the ships burned and shipyards destroyed.  And because all China was united, that was the end of China's exploration.  \n\nSo long as there is a chance we may come in to contact with others, I think the competitive nature of our species may wind up being one of our greatest advantages, and I am hesitant to put all our eggs in one government's basket.  Not when they might be able to burn humanity's ships, and leave us helpless under the stars."}, {"id": "2r862l", "body": "I live in Lebanon. We are a small country.

This is inconceivable at a global level (unless aliens attack, there is no common enemy or salient enough threat to unite mankind).\n\n&gt; * Running a world government is too complex: it requires too much information and a too large bureaucracy.\n\n&gt; * The system must be meticulously crafted to ensure (i) institutional strength (ii)\ndemocracy. \n\n&gt; * The system must have the appearance of institutional strength\n\n&gt; * Realism: Any institutional change must reflect the realities of power. States are not likely to give away meaningful powers to international institutions, and if they do, the set-up would privilege the powerful (which means that the set-up won't be legitimate and fair). The stepping stones to a world government aren't there, at least not a desirable one. For an extreme version of the realist argument against international institutions, see [this classic article by John Mearsheimer](http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0021.pdf).\n\n&gt; * Existing models (or stepping stones) for a world state have serious shortcomings: (i) the UN (ii) the European Parliament (if Europeans don't care enough to turn out to vote, why would a global demos?)\n\n&gt; * Nobody is going to make a push for a world state in the foreseeable future. European integration is difficult enough. Nationalism and the nation-state has become deeply embedded into people.\n\n&gt; *  There is no global demos. If you think people are apathetic in domestic elections, check out turn-out for the European Parliament elections. If the turn-out is that poor in EP elections, imagine how poor they'll be in much more distant elections based on more diverse interests!\n\n **A world government is not desirable:**\n\n&gt; * A world government risks tyranny.\n\n&gt; * It leads to homogeneity.\n\n&gt; * There won't be exit opportunities for those who disagree with the policies of the world government.\n\n&gt; * A world government won't have to compete with other states in providing public goods at the most efficient cost: a world state will be poorly run.\n\n&gt; * The groups that find themselves in a world state will feel uncertain about the intentions of others, the strength of the institutions and their ability to veto policies that go against their vital interests: a world government risks a world civil war (especially if the norm of sovereignty crumbles and there are no national boundaries to fall back on).\n\n&gt; * Robert Dahl's 'restricted size' argument: a world democracy would be the least democratic democracy possible: the weight of each vote will be as small as possible.\n\n&gt; * Democratic deliberation is impossible on a global level: no global demos.\n\n**The current system represents optimal desirability given the constraints:**\n\n&gt; * The multilateral world order is strengthening, not eroding.\n\n&gt; * While the UN does not take decisions collectively, equally, freely, openly and responsibly, it functions as well as it possibly could (both in outcomes and the level of democratic decision-making) given the collective action problems that such a large and diverse number of actors face. Despite the structural inequalities of the UN (the Security Council), it still carries legitimacy (can cite some research on this). \n\n&gt; * The efficiency of the UN is at its highest: Since the end of the Cold War, the UN has taken on quantitative, qualitative and normative transformations that reflect the demands of electorates and even go against the narrow interests of powerful state and non-state actors.\n\n&gt; * [The world is getting better, not worse](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.single.html): *\"The world is not falling apart.

A world government would, at some point, be the ideal. A federation like the US, although with much greater adherence to the principle of subsidiarity, extended across the world. You might be interested in [this lecture by Alexander Wendt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwgKUp_h1Mc), a prominent intenational relations scholar, making the case for why a world state is inevitable. There's a large and fun academic literature on this subject. Look up scholars like David Held, Koenig-Archibugi, Jan Aart Scholte and Raffaele Marchetti (see his book *Global Democracy: For and Against*), and search for \"global democracy\" on Google Scholar.\n\nI'll go through some points against a world government. If you want something more in-depth on why a world state is neither desirable nor feasible, check out the following lectures by two international relations scholars (Keohane, Wendt and Fearon are arguably the three most prominent IR scholars of the last decades btw):\n\n* [Keohane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM-J_TM2pRc)\n* [Fearon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heWczrVE48I)\n\nAt the top of my head, the common objections to a world government seem as if they can be put into three types (I'll put sub-arguments under each type):\n\n **A world government is not feasible:**\n\n&gt; * Federations have historically only come into being as a reaction to external enemies\nor common interests. This is inconceivable at a global level (unless aliens attack, there is no common enemy or salient enough threat to unite mankind).\n\n&gt; * Running a world government is too complex: it requires too much information and a too large bureaucracy.\n\n&gt; * The system must be meticulously crafted to ensure (i) institutional strength (ii)\ndemocracy. \n\n&gt; * The system must have the appearance of institutional strength\n\n&gt; * Realism: Any institutional change must reflect the realities of power. States are not likely to give away meaningful powers to international institutions, and if they do, the set-up would privilege the powerful (which means that the set-up won't be legitimate and fair).

It is done directly through buying politicians. \n\nThis happens wherever you are, regardless of the size of your country. (e.g. wealthy Cuban Americans support an embargo which hasn't worked for 54 years or Saudi relatives sponsoring fundamentalist terrorists.) The US and Saudi's influence over your region would not be any less under a global world state. There are vested interests way beyond the White House or Royal Family and these interests will not be eroded under Global Federal State.\n\nPolitical corruption can normally be put down to a lack of oversight. Simply put, when individuals believe they can get away with misleading their constituents, they are more likely to rip you off. (This is a side effect of [the principal - agent problem.)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem) ***This can happen in any political structure***,  from anarchical &amp; direct-democracies to dictatorships. \n\nA free press and an independent judicial system are two popular democratic measures that can be undertaken. And I don't mean to offend your country but Lebanon isn't particular competent at either [keeping a free press](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2012/lebanon#.VKhYHSusVCY) or [maintaining a fair and equal justice system](http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/lebanon.htm). \n\nLebanon is doing far better than it's neighbours, but your political leaders have a lot less oversight than leaders in other democracies, [particularly after given the executive branch unfettered control in the interpretation of laws](http://echoducedre.weebly.com/an-incomplete-constitution-lebanon-and-its-judicial-branch.html). \n\nThis is more likely the cause of Lebanon's corruption. If there was an independent judicial review that could prosecute representatives that took bribes from foreign countries, or a free press that could tell the unfettered truth to the people of Lebanon, perhaps this would decreases the incentives to act corruptly. \n\nUltimately having a universal, uniform authority that controls all decisions not only makes these measures more complex to instigate, but it also makes tougher for any challenges to power to be upheld. Can you imagine any of our current global news networks affecting change in Russia or China, let alone a globally corrupt structure.\n\n&gt; I think most people now accept democracy.\n\nActually [only 13% of people in the last decade lived in actual democracy.](http://www.economist.com/node/8908438) How can the majority of people support a system that they haven't experienced yet. We can't just assume everyone would support yours or my political process. In fact there are many living in these \"full democracies\" right now who are unhappy with the state of the country. \n\n&gt; there won't be a war in israel and palestine if the world is one.\n\nHow? Even if there was only one government made up of equal representatives from both parties, could they even come to a decision? And would that decision even be accepted by both sides? Likely anything decided would be opposed and there'd be a drawn out process in order bring the two side to negotiate and we'd still be exactly where we are today.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Corruption comes in all form of government. It's a global phenomenon. Having one global government wouldn't remove the problem, it would just become universal.*"}, {"id": "2r862l", "body": "I live in Lebanon. We are a small country.

I used to be a Marxist and a proponent for a International State or \"Stateless society\" that was universal.  I reasoned that something that was just in one country should be just and rational everywhere.  Though I think it would solve a lot of problems - some you mentioned - overall I'm an Anarchist in support of small communitarian society because of the diversity of values and perspectives on this planet.  As an Anarchist, I believe in the Non-Aggression Principle, so any society that says \"if you're gay we beat you to death\" or \"if you do drugs we take away your freedom and put you in a small confinement for years\" would be stricken out of court immediately.  However, a community could say \"No drugs allowed\" and if a individual does drugs he's talked to, and as long as all parties are civil a arrangement can be made.  The individual could move to a nearby community where drugs are allowed, the expenses being paid by the community he's leaving, for no individual should feel a lofty burden for taking hold of the opportunity to pursue his freedom and happiness however he chooses (as long as he isn't harming someone without their consent of course).  Overall though it seems reasonable that in every community all drugs could be done in private, the major distinction would be what drugs would be done publicly.\n\nTheir could be agrarian communities where cars are not allowed for example.  Or societies where loud music is not allowed, and some where they are.  Overall this is the best solution to freedoms that conflict each other, (my freedom to listen to music and your freedom to enjoy silence for example) while still living in a society.  The same goes with nudist colonies.  As long as there's a place where it's allowed, there can also be moderate restrictions that infringe upon other people's freedoms that consent to said restrictions (but must never be incarcerated for such violations because of the fundamental unjust and corrupting effects of punishment - imprisonment being the most common form).\n\nTo a small extent I disagree with you that the world over has accepted \"Democracy\" but the main point I would make is that Representative Democracy is a sham.  Especially in America.  Voting for someone to supposedly make the decisions you would make and in-effect do your thinking for you and allow you to remain ignorant and apathetic is a major error in Liberal Democratic societies, both from Representative Democracy and Capitalism - but now I'm getting off-topic.\n\nNice idea though.

[...] We the peoples of the world have become a global culture.\n\nI think you greatly, greatly overestimate the degree of cultural globalization the world actually has attained. Terrorists wearing blue jeans is certainly not an indicator that they have accepted western culture and that they see no problem with it, same thing for Chinese people watching American films: you're taking sporadic examples and making disproportionate conclusions from them. No, there are still great differences between cultures, but I think the flaw in your reasoning is that you take the economic and urban lifestyle (which indeed seems to be similar everywhere) and generalizing to the whole culture: a culture is very complex, difficult to define, it's comprised of faiths, customs, idioms and dialects, and vastly different ways of thinking and seeing the world. It's an intricate ecosystem that took centuries to form itself, very interdependent, and IMO we are far, far away from having a global culture for everyone (and that's good).\n\nAbout the global government idea: I disagree with it and I'll tell you why. Seeing that cultures are not the same, that people are different, a state must protect and act for the good of its people. Definitions of \"good\" vary from culture to culture, and one government certainly would have to make sometimes impossible compromises between this or that ethnicity, etc. Furthermore, it has already been pointed out that the bigger a government gets, the furthest away it goes from the people, and therefore, the more corruption there is. The leaders have no accountability to the people because they are far away and segregated from it: it's a sociological phenomenon, the elites group themselves and segregating themselves from the rest of the people, living in good neighborhoods with the other elites. Also, what if the government turns bad and there is suddenly an uprising? What do you think the leaders of the world would do when they have the entire world's army to their disposition (yes, there would still be an army because there would still be tensions between people)? Do you really think a 7 billion people uprising is possible? \n\nAlso, \"democracy\" as you use the term: what if it's not the best political system? What if there were another, better system? After all, it has only existed for about 250 years all in all, and has been a very small page of our history: why assume that it's going to be this way forever? Apart from political debate, what if we discover a new political or economical system which is more beneficial to the world, but less to the elites? Do you think they're going to let go of their advantages? That's also the role of borders, and of nations: to uphold one vision of what is right, what is moral, to represent one culture among hundreds, and more fundamentally to avoid cultural confrontations as much as possible. With a huge government, things are just going to be pretty much static: social progress is going to be very hard, next to impossible, because protests or petitions or whatever are going to have a relatively small impact at the world scale. The civil society's voice is going to be even weaker than today.\n\nA political system is more fragile than what you think. The benefit of having many but relatively small countries is that for example a Coup D'Etat in Thailand isn't going to affect very much people who live in Panama. It limits the damage that a bad political event can have. If there were a Coup D'Etat in the world government, everyone would be affected, and the leader would have access to everything, every resource, every part of the world. It also makes it just that much more appealing. \n\nIn general, I think you have way too much confidence in a world government to stay clean of corruption, and represent the \"greater good\". Different countries exist also for a very simple reason: the good old trial and failure system. It is precisely because we have had so many views on questions like \"what is the best political system\", \"what is the best economic system\", \"what is truth\", \"what is good\", that we've been able to progress as a species. Systems have been tried out, some have failed and some have succeeded, and most sincere people will take what seems like the best, while not forgetting to not be too confident in their choices and always be open-minded. \n\nTo use your same example of people looking back on us: imagine you had the exact same idea, but in the 15th century, where the global consensus was that monarchy is the best political system. Representative democracy has never been tried anywhere, it hasn't even been theorized yet, so everyone pretty much agrees that monarchy is the best system. Now fast-forward to the 21st century: looking back on this idea, wouldn't people have thought \"good thing it never happened, they didn't know how bad monarchy was and what plight they would've brought on themselves by having a king of the world\"? Well, now imagine people in the 25th century living in a new political system, much better than ours: wouldn't they have thought the same thing about us?

Essentially, Government = group that holds a monopoly on the justified use of force in a given area.  Whether democracy or despotism, this is the basic feature.  \n\nObviously, a large degree of either fear or consensus is necessary to achieve this.  For world government, consensus on even extremely broad issues is problematic.  If individual countries have so much trouble agreeing, how would the world not be exponentially more difficult?  Consensus is improbable, and yet government through fear would require at the very least squashing sovereignty, and at the worst, world war.\n\nSure, globalization has increased exponentially in the modern age.  But  the error of linearly equating globalization with a breakdown of nationalism is not new.  In early 20th C. Russia, Lenin desired German victory in WW1 since they were more advanced, and according to Marxism, nearer to the inevitable revolution.  What Lenin, Stalin, and others quickly learned was that it was easier to convince a German communist to kill a  Russian communist than it was to convince a German communist to kill another German.  And vice versa.\n\nNational and cultural identity may be less important than centuries past, but that does not necessarily mean that they are not extremely important aspects of basic political life.

The only way we have to prevent people from acting selfishly is to have a loop where everyone is kept in check, more or less (I agree that the system is imperfect): people are kept in check by the police, a democratic government is kept in check by the people (there are other links to that loop, of course).\n\nThe system is imperfect. There needs to be more than one safety to prevent one party (to the loop) from \"escaping\" said loop. Other countries prevent things like a leader not respecting democracy anymore. You will notice that that works less effectively the greater the power imbalance between the countries.\n\nA world government where one person can take decisions for the whole planet is very frightening to me.\n\nBesides, we more or less have a world government: things like NATO for example. It's just that many people need to agree instead of one person being allowed to veto things.\n\n---\n\nMore importantly\n============\n\n&gt; in a world goverment no single religion will be able to rule\n\n#\n\n&gt; everyone will agree on a language most likely english.\n\n#\n\n&gt; there won't be a war in israel and palestine if the world is one.\n\nI disagree here. Having only one government doesn't make people suddenly agree. Tensions don't disappear because there is only one person that is allowed to take the decisions.\n\nThe only way for tensions to die down is through education and communication. People need to understand their opponent's ideas, acknowledge their mistakes and eventually arrive to an agreement. Those things take a hell of a long time (to quote the French author Bernard Werber: \"to a worldwide movement, a worldwide [time] scale\")."}, {"id": "cndesde", "body": "Your argument against one person taking decisions on a global basis will be the same when that one person rules a country of 300 million or a billion people.

Other countries prevent things like a leader not respecting democracy anymore. You will notice that that works less effectively the greater the power imbalance between the countries.\n\nOther countries don't act in the interest of other countries. Countries deal with each other based on their own interest. There never is an intervention to save a people from tyranny or whatever. It is always interests. this is why the UN fails and there needs to be a system of global democracy.\n\n"}, {"id": "cndesde", "body": "Your argument against one person taking decisions on a global basis will be the same when that one person rules a country of 300 million or a billion people.

The only difference is in scale. I feel less connected to you, a Lebanese, than I do another Canadian and I feel less connected to a an Albertan as I do one of my fellow Quebecer, I feel less connected to an English-speaking Quebecer as I do one of my fellow Frenchies, etcetera up to my immediate family.\n\nMy point is that, because of that weaker connection, I should not be in charge of making decisions that will affect you without your approval, because it will very likely be slanted heavily in my favor instead of yours.\n\nIn this perspective, the US (and Canada to a lesser extent, I don't know about other countries) does very well: they have multiple levels of government that are more or less independent. This is a good thing as it localizes the administration.\n\nYou could make the argument that local administrations sometimes abuse their powers and I agree. It's just that contrary to a world government, there is a level above them people can go to to keep them into check.\n\n&gt; Other countries don't act in the interest of other countries. Countries deal with each other based on their own interest.\n\nExactly. So you get conflicts. And the way to solve that is through communication, as I explained above.\nOf course, this requires a certain symmetry of power between countries (which there is not at the moment). But there is just no way a world government will suddenly make people care enough about other people on the other side of the globe regardless of whether they share the same country name (in a way, we already do, we share the same planet name).\n\n&gt; There never is an intervention to save a people from tyranny or whatever.\n\nWell, there are sanctions against Russia because of its intervention in Ukraine, there are sanctions against North Korea. South Korea allows them North Korean refugees in.\n\nClearly we disagree on why those things are done. I think there are people in this world whose interest is in seeing people getting a fair treatment while others are more selfish while you seem to think everyone is selfish.\n\nI don't think it's particularly productive to try to change your view on that, so I won't.\nBut you can't deny that these things don't happen and that they benefit the people who suffer from tyranny, regardless of the ulterior motive.\n\nLastly, you have to consider that you can't just magically kill a tyrant and expect a country to magically become a perfect democracy. You have to deal with those tyrants, giving them the stick (sanctions) when they do things you don't like and carrots (international aid) when they behave.\n\nInternational politics are not so simple as \"ok, let's free country X\". It is my understanding that the US\u00a0tried just that and it doesn't seem to have worked very well.\n\n&gt; To a worldwide movement, a worldwide scale."}, {"id": "2r862l", "body": "I live in Lebanon.

US state and individual EU nation governments generally work a lot better than US federal government for that very reason.\n\nDifference in government also allows different solutions to be implemented at smaller scale, and the best ones are emulated.  A more homogenous government loses this ability.\n\nLebanon and Israel/Palestine, IMO, kind of sums up why a world government can't work. Israel-Palestine had a solution propose by the closest thing to the \"world government\" at the time in the UN, and the Arab States rejected the original world solution partition and invaded Israel anyways.  Now the world can't really agree on what the Israel-Palestine solution \"should\" be, so I'm not sure how a word government fixes that.\n\n\"World consensus\" is often cited when it suits a particular party, and ignored when it doesn't.  Especially in the middle east.\n\nThe Middle East in particular has a lot of conflicts that are religious / ethnic in origin, such that most of the rest of the world has little understanding of how to fix them or how to effectively enforce solutions.  Dropping NATO soldiers into Afghanistan / Iraq was a disaster because the foreign boots on the ground had poor understanding of the people they were attempting to police.  Regional conflicts will still need to be mediated and resolved regionally... I again don't see the benefit of world government.\n\nWorld government has a major enforcement problem.  Even if we come up with ideas that have to be executed at a world level (pollution and sustainability come to mind), how on earth do you enforce that?

Currently they can usually switch countries if the need so arises, then, they can't.\n\nAlso there's the problem of spreading. Spreading, in the statistical sense is very important, it means whatever test sample you take needs to be not from a single area but rather from a much larger area because small areas tend to have very heavy deviations from the average.\n\nIn Sweden for example you'd be relatively hardpressed to find a person AGAINST universal healthcare, in the USA it's relatively hard to find a person for this proposal (yes I know most US citizens are for such a thing, but there are still a dispropotionate amount of people against it).\n\nNow currently if you, as an individual find your views to differ from a country you can move to one that does confirm to your views. Some choices (if not a lot) have no right answer, they are bound to make some people very happy and some very unhappy. Some people for example are more easily offended and might want every bit of violence to be removed from public television, some other people however think that everything should be allowed on TV and if you don't like it simply don't watch it.\n\nThe best way to keep the most people happy is by giving people options, theoretically, an infinite amount of countries with each a slightly different set of laws than the rest can keep everyone happy (assuming they are all still equally populated and such). However seeing as such a thing is impossible.\n\nNow obviously this point becomes moot the moment space colonization becomes a thing. If that's the case a form of world government (although the amount of power it would have is debatable) is useful if only to keep relations with colonies. In such a case a world government is nessecary, seeing as you can't really expect every nation to maintain its own \"space border\" and dictate travel through that (really imagine France trying to keep illegal immigrants out by trying to protect the bit of space just above France).\n\nA form of world regulation is probably a good thing, sort of similar as to what we have in Europe with the EU. The EU put an end to a lot of bullcrap that currently still happens on a global scale. For example with the trading of commerce. Some countries may say that whatever weight you put on a package may vary 1%, some others may say a maximum of 2%. As a result of that, the 2% countries cannot export to the 1% countries because it would effectively be illegal to sell it there.\n\nBy having a union for the world rather than a government you can regulate a lot of things that also affect other countries (climate, product health and safety, consumer rights, travelling etc), without having to have the same laws so that businesses and people can't decide which country is best for them.\n\nSo in short: A world government is a bad idea because it robs people of choice.

Some people for example are more easily offended and might want every bit of violence to be removed from public television, some other people however think that everything should be allowed on TV and if you don't like it simply don't watch it.\n\nThe best way to keep the most people happy is by giving people options, theoretically, an infinite amount of countries with each a slightly different set of laws than the rest can keep everyone happy (assuming they are all still equally populated and such). However seeing as such a thing is impossible.\n\nNow obviously this point becomes moot the moment space colonization becomes a thing. If that's the case a form of world government (although the amount of power it would have is debatable) is useful if only to keep relations with colonies. In such a case a world government is nessecary, seeing as you can't really expect every nation to maintain its own \"space border\" and dictate travel through that (really imagine France trying to keep illegal immigrants out by trying to protect the bit of space just above France).\n\nA form of world regulation is probably a good thing, sort of similar as to what we have in Europe with the EU. The EU put an end to a lot of bullcrap that currently still happens on a global scale. For example with the trading of commerce. Some countries may say that whatever weight you put on a package may vary 1%, some others may say a maximum of 2%. As a result of that, the 2% countries cannot export to the 1% countries because it would effectively be illegal to sell it there.\n\nBy having a union for the world rather than a government you can regulate a lot of things that also affect other countries (climate, product health and safety, consumer rights, travelling etc), without having to have the same laws so that businesses and people can't decide which country is best for them.\n\nSo in short: A world government is a bad idea because it robs people of choice. Something to regulate things on a global scale IS a good idea for a meriad of reasons.\n\n"}, {"id": "cne5uvz", "body": "This point of being able to escape oppression by immigrating to different countries has been brought us several times here. And I think most of you don't realize how hard it is to immigrate because of how hard it is to get accepted as an immigrant in another country. In fact even people living in oppressive regimes don't have a lot of ways to immigrate. \n\nYou gave homosexuality as an example. Well in Lebanon homosexuality is illegal. Yet if an homosexual were to apply to any embassy as a refugee for being gay, he would be rejected flat out. It is the same for many other people in many other places.\n\nIn fact the only way that is going to make immigration legal for people is to have a world government.

If the United Earth had purely terrestrial aspirations and inward-turned aggression instead of outward ambition, we could well create a hell planet. Not an unstable environment one like we have with nice breaks in the clouds, but a well-orchestrated hellscape, like a planetary dictatorship even if it weren't a formal dictatorship.\n\nThe issue is what I call \"scaling [up, or down]\". A few assholes make for bullying, and if they rear children they make for abuse, and if they gather together they make a gang, a cartel, paramilitary, formal military, and even government that abuses and tortures and harasses efficiently coast-to-coast depending on power levels. If a government scales up to a planetary authority, and is abusive, then they'd almost certainly be extremely powerful given the resources available and cooperation of all regional power, and the sky would literally be the limit of abuses.\n\nThe problem is you only get one shot at a global government for it to be good or bad, because it will pull massive resources and affect everybody, and whatever would emerge would be entrenched and only an extreme civil war would resolve it--if not create more problems. Unfortunately folks usually don't get things right the first try, and a global government has zero margin for error given the enormity of the danger and responsibility of it.\n\nFortunately we do have some experience in governing as a species.\n\nTherefore if the United Earth was eased into by mass cooperation and a shift in how people view the world, and we turned outward to the stars, it'd probably be a good thing. It would have to start as a confederation, and after other planets were colonized and terraformed, and space occupied by folks independent of earth resources and government, United Earth could become a full-blown federation and become even more efficient. However, if the United Earth started as a federation or anything else, it'd quickly dissolve into a dictatorship or civil wars that...well...would look like now.\n\nEarth sort of is like a big country that undergoes civil wars periodically and skirmishes for the world. For one of those \"lords\" to \"win\" would be bad, and would require force to keep on all tiers of life. That's the problem with an exclusive planetary federation.\n\nSo the view change should be incredibly the high tier of risk involved. The only sort of government that should emerge is a very limited confederation who's only responsibility is to end war and maintain historical boarders and certain national rights (currency, elected representatives, civil law, globally accepted civil rights, etc.).\n\nIt seems that's the direction of the West, NATO, and the UN concept. That's complicated, however, and still very risky. A United Earth confederation's only goals at this point should be to end war and get your ass to Mars.\n\nStill I wouldn't count your world governments before they hatch.

In a perfect society communism works, and the same could be said about a market based economy. The real issues come when people are introduced and a couple of smart ass try and ruin the system for everybody, sometimes including themselves while trying to make it better for themselves. I am american and I see the horrible consequences of being market based. In our society we have come to listen to headlines and be responsive to trigger words more so than rhetoric and reason. By saying this I in no way shape or form condone,accept, or preach some theist or anti-theist view. By introducing people, the flaws inherent to humans play a larger role. In an american society, money has corrupted a beautiful system of checks and balances and true freedom. In a global society, depending on how we devise a plan to elect leaders or list their control over the citizens the outcome could be disastrous forget about devising plans on how we should face issues further down the road. In a vacuum, a global government would work. But as far as the issues you mentioned about politicians being bought in lebanon from another country, think about who would elect leaders and how much control they would have over their respective peoples. What you seek is noble but in this world a government to rule the world will simply enslave the mass populous. When the government rules all, they decide who the bad people are and sub-sequentially under a microscopic radar for anyone that could be a threat. Anyone could be a threat, and at a global level, making a global government would be the same as the world handing over freedom for a state of mind that will never work.

Montana is absolutely beautiful, the people are nice and very liberal in missoula (other cities not so much). California is always pegged as this amazing and liberal place....but I don't see it that way. They have weird laws and taxes and it is very expensive to live in most parts of California. I would honestly try and stay away from bigger cities. I will admit I am a little bit of a small town girl, but in my opinion, bigger cities are the scary thing. I can get around easily here and have made some great friends and found a job fairly quickly, but there are things about California that are absurd to me after growing up in such an amazing place. I think as long as you understand what sort of resources you can utilize in America, it can be a really great place. Although we have a lot of improvements to make, it probably isn't as scary as the media makes it out to be. Be wary, but not too wary! Of course there are terrible people and policies anywhere you go, so just do your research, don't come into it blindly, but come take advantage of some opportunites and meet some people who would love to make a new friend from the Netherlands! \nAnd as far as the healthcare thing goes, a lot of jobs offer healthcare benefits, although it would be nice for everyone to receive benefits, but hopefully we will make strides with that in the near future. There are a lot of government and nonprofit organizations that will help you out if you need it. Like i said, as long as you know about your resources, you will be just fine!

Also, people who engage in lawsuits like this typically go after those who are rich, meaning that for you to find yourself on the wrong end of one of these frivolous lawsuits would most likely mean that you have become financially successful.\n\n&gt; Loopholes that can screw you over and ridiculous ways you can get screwed over by and whatnot.\n\nYou're going to have to expand on this.

Yes private practice doctors make 7 figures...  but they're basically family businesses, and those 7 figures include all the salaries of the nurses, and staff, and all the expenses.  If you think THAT'S your path to american riches, look it up.  US medical private practices are barely making any money and most are going bankrupt.\n\nYou could do the same thing as a lawyer.

Now you have to save for the $60-$100k to get each kid their bachelors degree...  And you're putting another $20k a year for a shit retirement.\n\nBut wait...  you don't want your kids to grow up to make $45k a year with a bachelors degree.

I certainly wouldn't call us capitalist by nature. \n\nCapitalism in its present form began around the Age of Discovery (16th century) when private investors established large-scale joint-stock formal partnerships that were legally recognized by the state. Initially, this was a special royal privilege awarded on a case by case basis to selected organizations, the chartered companies such as British East India Company. During the Industrial revolution, this became the main mode of economic organization in Western countries.\n\nHowever, way before joint-stock companies were invented, all human civilizations had private property rights and some kind of private enterprises, so it could be argued that humans have been in some sense \"capitalist\" for at least 6,000 years, all the recorded history.  \nHunter-gatherer tribes didn't have true private property rights or enterprises, although they all recognized the concept of private possessions. They weren't capitalist, but they certainly weren't communist either.
