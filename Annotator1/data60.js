There are serious parallels between the Great Gatsby, and Hip-Hop culture. Both portray their main characters as being born from poverty, and progressing to riches only through disregard of their morals, chasing money. Illmatic, a hiphop classic, is full of references to this part of hiphop culture. \"Is like a maze full of black rats trapped\" says Nas, in the famous NY state of mind. The next track, \"Life's a bitch\" goes further into this mentality -\"Visualising the realism of life in actuality fuck who's the baddest a persons status depends on salary\". Another classic hiphop song C.R.E.A.M. resigns to this fact as Gatsby does - \"Cash rules everything around me.\"\n\nThe racism aspect is also clear - \"Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon, and at the airport they check all through my bags and tell me it's random **but we stay winning** \" This is also where the stereotypical hate for the police comes from. Nas, in a song about the crushing poverty where he grew up - Memory Lane - says \"No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace\". Even worse than the fellow black people trying to get out - like Gatsby, are the police, trying to keep the \" Black rats\" in the trap. \"Judges hanging niggas, incorrect bails, for direct sales, my intellect prevails, from a hanging cross, with nails.\"\n\nThe mentality of being born into a racist system, trying to keep you down, combined with the constant drumming into you what the American dream is, motivates people to do terrible things. But I think that Hiphop deserves more attention, and credit, for being a modern day retelling of the flawed American Dream, and Racist System, and what happens when they meet.\n\n\"He see it as another felony drug arrest, any day could be the day he picks the wrong thug to test, slug through the vest, shot in the street **for pulling heat on a father whose baby gotta eat**\""}, {"id": "cmz3fhx", "body": "Your view is WAY too vague.

It's more like their criticizing the mainstream rap/hip-hop, which I believe deserves the criticisms. \n\nFurthermore, we can definitely criticize specific songs and/or artists who *happen* to be rappers. I see nothing wrong with that. If your music promotes bad ideas, then you deserve to be criticized. Simply being a hip-hop artists should not shield you from otherwise justified criticism.

All of these names and a lot of the culture of hip hop now is centered around power dominance, sexual exploitation, drugs, aesthetic decadence, material goods, and every once in awhile something political (thanks Macklemore). How many people know about Pinata or even thought provoking Tyler or Chance? I'd have to throw more than a few rocks before I found someone. I'd say the same about asking people my age (early 20's) if they've ever even listened to Illmatic.\n\nThe biggest dichotomy of this is Kanye West, who as artistically self reflexive and extraordinarily provocative and innovative as he is to help take rap seriously as an art form, his antics and behavior is easily eccentric and easy to hate on."}, {"id": "cmz5wda", "body": "Yeah I agree with you a lot, even though Jay z isn't really that political of a rapper. I don't think that the party rappers are totally bad though - it's still a form of expression that's difficult (apart from Iggy). I think that the drugs are part of hiphop culture from the beginning - it was born literally from drugs. The materialism goes with the American dream as well. I think that there's still a lot of conscious rappers, I mean if you look at the albums that have come out recently J Cole's blown up, Big K.R.I.T., ScHoolboy, Kendrick etccc. \n\nI think Kanye West represents what hiphop is now, he has party tracks, but there's always a deeper meaning in his albums, and a lot of political songs, as well as technical brilliance."}, {"id": "2pqfx4", "body": "I've been thinking about this for a while.

I grew up breakdancing, loving graff and rapping. I love a lot of styles of music, but rap is kinda my home. \n\nRap doesn't get enough credit, because it is more superficial that a lot of other forms of music. That is my opinion, but it's rather obvious. Rappers like Tupac paint a picture of street life, and deal with a variety of problems plaguing people in real life. However, he does not do it with the same poetic prose that Bob Dylan does. If you do not like folk, and you listen to folk music, you wouldn't walk away going \"man, folk music is really stupid and only talks about dumb shit\". However, if you are NOT a rap fan, that is exactly what you think of rap, and this is in part what makes rap so great to me. \n\nOne of my favorite self aware rap lyrics was by El-P when he said \"mother fucker, do I sound abstract?\". Rap does a lot of unique things other music doesnt do. For instance, its very self referential (in regards to the actual rapper, and the genre). The Rolling Stones arent going to start a song going \"its the Rolling stones back on the mic\".  Rap is also very visceral, and for all the talk about metaphors, it is probably the most basic and straight foward genre there is. Saying \"Im like Beavis I get nothing butt-head\" isn't a real metaphor. And this is by someone all rap fans consider a true lyricist (Big L). \n\nI am kinda rambling, but I think I have a point. \n\nRap doesnt get taken as seriously as other genres because by definition, rap doesn't take itself as serious from an artistic stand point. It is being \"real\" not \"artistic\" most of the time. It has a beautiful place in the world, but it is along the same reasons why Graff won't be found in actual art museums any time soon...because Graff isn't meant to cater to that, and in many ways is rebelling against traditional forms of art. Rap is rebelling against rock the same way Rock rebelled against top40, and the same way jazz rebelled against classical music most likely. 100 years from now, will Sir Mix A-Lot's Baby Got Back be considered \"classical\" like Futurama suggest? \n\nTupac's poetry is terrible compared to actual poetry. Then again, Tupac wasn't trying to be an actual poet. I don't think so, at least. \n\nTherefore, no matter how relevant rap is in regards to a modern day retelling of the flawed American dream, it won't be welcomed in high society with actual open arms because it isn't made for high society. It was meant for the people, and the people love rap. "}, {"id": "2pqfx4", "body": "I've been thinking about this for a while.

One of the most opportune moments is when the urban guerrilla soldier is called upon to pursue his guerrilla comrades outside the military base. Instead of following the orders of the \"gorillas\", the military urban guerrilla must join the ranks of the revolutionaries by handing over the weapons and ammunition he carries, or the military vehicle he operates. The advantage of this method is that the rebels receive weapons and ammunition from the army, navy, air force, military police, civilian guard or the police without any great work, *since it reaches their hands by government transportation.*\n\nOur veterans know first-hand how to operate the very war machines which our police have been issued (again, without any training). \n\nAs the United States has turned their back on our veterans, disenfranchised them, and disillusioned them to the soldier's true worth to their government (read: worse than dirt, dirt may be cultivated), allowing veterans to [eliminate themselves](http://www.vice.com/read/republican-senator-killed-veterans-suicide-prevention-bill-1217) and treating them as undesirables would be the most efficient way to hamstring one of the most potentially powerful assets to a revolution.\n\nPlease change my view. \n\nEDIT 1: See [\"The Bonus Army\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army), which marched on Washington demanding their rightful compensation, where police shot and killed two veterans, and other veterans were killed throughout the demonstration.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you happen to be European, you may enjoy D'Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America\", which compares the democratic systems in the U.S. to the centuries-old, deeply-entrenched Aristocracy of the Old World- as well as D'Tocqueville's observations on how the European Aristocracy maintained it's status quo through *de facto* caste systems and, two of these three points, violence and poverty. \n\nAs a Transhumanist I also agree that these age-old problems are well defined and require scientific achievement to truly eradicate (though the U.S. alone makes enough food to feed the world several times over, they don't because political powers at work see that food does not reach the people who need it most- sadly a consequence of a lack of political will).\n\nI do mention in another comment the concept of \"strategic incompetence\", or succeeding by failing, so if the U.S. continually shows they are too incompetent to take care of it's veterans (even if it can), eventually people no longer expect them to, and that vacuum is filled by NGOs and Non-Profits. \n\nAlso, an interesting quote from a fun U.S. film, the Boondock Saints (strange placement, I know!):\n\n&gt;Now, we must all fear evil men. But, there is another kind of evil which we must fear most \u2026 and that is the indifference of good men!\n\nYou may find that addiction is much more a political issue than it seems, as well (now that I think about it!). If you are not aware of the scientific restraints in the US on psycho-pharmacology, researchers must fight tooth and nail to get permission to study marijuana and LSD (two non-addictive substances). Whereas countries such as Uruguay (a beautiful little blip south or Brazil that I had the good fortune to call home for a number of years) have begun to use marijuana to ease the withdrawl of cocaine addiction in their prison populations- something that would have been impossible before 2012, when it was legalized there nationwide.\n\nPowerful lobby groups also work to pad judges' pockets to issue heavier prison sentences to maintain mandatory minimum capacities in for-profit, corporate prisons. Other lobby groups work day and night to keep marijuana and other drugs illegal. \n\nThe situation is so beyond fucked in the U.S., and that's precisely why my original theory still seems plausible, albeit unlikely. \n\nIn the end, science will prevail!

I sincerely wish it would enter political currency once again without stigma. \"Conspiracy theorist\" has become a moniker synonymous with \"nutcase\"- and I find this disheartening as history has shown numerous conspiracies, many debunked, and many well-founded, if not completely affirmed (take the alleged attacks on the USS Maddox which gave just cause to enter the Vietnam conflict, which we know today not to be true).\n\nI am certain there are already CMVs addressing this. Although \"conspiracy\" generally refers to more than one individual colluding, clandestinely, to create a detrimental effect (although it is used, sometimes facetiously, to collude towards positive effect). I'm currently in the midst of conspiring with friends in secret to welcome home a long-absent friend with a surprise homecoming party.\n\nThe recent attacks against Sony Enterprises by the Guardians of Peace, regardless of state sponsorship, is a conspiracy- the current theories on this conspiracy concern whether or not the the DPRK was involved, or if China assisted, etc. To provide a contemporary example. \n\nI do not believe every injustice is due to someone's benefit. As the world watched UN troops abandon, and Western powers ignore, the Rwandan Genocide, for example, it was to no one's benefit. Only after Tutsis and Hutus alike banded together to shame world governments did some semblance of rescue occur- and this was largely to save face vis-a-vis ignored crimes against humanity. Clinton's face had already been slapped onto the cover of Time's \"Man of the Year\" edition, what would it matter if they ignored the pleas of Africans under the machete? As ignoring the conflict became a detriment to national image, Western powers finally stepped in.\n\nThese are just some thoughts and I apologize if they seem convoluted as I am focusing on essays and just wanted to get back to your thoughtful response. The CMV community has earned my respect through this post alone, and I hope to be a more active and contributing member in the future.

In Marxian discourse, Marx and Engels tended to use the terms \"Socialism\" and \"Communism\" interchangably -- which rather throws a wrench in your definition of \"Socialism\" as merely being *\"worker ownership of the means of production\"* (since the standard definition of Marxian Communism is \"a stateless, moneyless, classless society\"). I'd regard that definition as being important, albeit incomplete. Even if we look towards Leninism, which defined \"Socialism\" as a concrete, distinct \"stage\" of political and economic organization (as effectively an intermediary stage between Capitalist development and the realization of Communism proper), that definition doesn't fully describe the nuance of this conception. You have to note that both of these models reject the notion of \"private property\" and thereby private accumulation as well -- two central hallmarks of Capitalism.\n\nDemocracy is, in fact, an important component of Communism, particularly during a revolutionary period, whichever way you look at it. However, it would be disingenuous to not admit that \"democracy\" is not primarily what Socialism/Communism is interested in realizing, and that it's really only a useful component or instrument in the process. For instance we can talk about democracy -- but democracy for who, anyway? Certainly not Capitalists, who would find themselves excluded from this process until such a time as they're destroyed as a class power. It's arguable that democracy has historically been a model for bourgeois class rule, and that in actuality it represents a \"mystification\" of a process that does nothing but mediate the antagonisms of 'Capital' and 'Labor' and thereby reinforce the Capitalist system. Socialism has no need for such democracy. Democracy in Socialist terms, for \"the class\", can in fact imply a totalitarian apparatus of force and power for the enemies of that class. A revolutionary democracy does not consult with the bourgeoisie, because Socialism seeks to subvert the social relationships of Capitalism and replace them with Socialist/Communist social relationships in \"totality\" -- by force, if necessary.\n\nHowever we'd like to define Socialism, there is one thing we can always agree on; it's anti-Capitalist. Capitalism is understood to be a relationship of production that relies on social \"classes\" (defined by their relationship to the means of production: namely, whether they own the means of production, or do not) to function. It's a relationship of dispossession from the \"forces of production\" (the factories, the machines, the land, the money) which means that the working class, the \"proletariat\", has to sell their labor to survive because they don't have meaningful or direct access to life-needs (in a market economy, we provision our resources from the market, instead of historically growing or producing them ourselves). The Capitalists/bourgeoisie profit off this relationship from owning the forces of production and \"means of subsistence\" and purchasing our labor at a loss (because they have a superior bargaining position). The model you've described, of mass cooperatives, can be very easily construed to in fact be a Capitalist system relying on a Capitalist market-place. In this case, the \"bourgeoisie\" isn't around anymore, but has instead become abstracted into the collective organization that operates the co-op [for profit]. In fact this isn't even that different from corporations in the first place, given that they rarely have a totalitarian despot at their helm but are chaired by shareholders, boards, and union officials, and so on. All co-operatives do is increase the scope of ownership, when **anti-Capitalism has as its historic mission the very abolition of such \"ownership\" as a category.**\n\nThis is why co-ops even exist in the first place under the auspices of the Capitalist system -- they don't reject its fundamental tenets. They in fact embrace the logic of Capitalist exchange (producing things for the purpose of selling them, reducing the costs of labor to remain competitive, produce profits, etc. I think a lot of people that work in co-ops can tell you the experience isn't that great). When people talk about *\"worker ownership of the means of production\"*, **they don't mean co-ops** -- what they mean is that the **means of production should be owned by the working class as a totality**, in that the factories, fields, and human arms should be scaled towards the universal production of items for use-value, to be placed at the dispensation of the entire human race. Not owned \"democratically\" and operated for the profit of the owners, however broad or inclusive. That isn't Socialism. Socialism abolishes private ownership and the commodity. We can say that productive enterprises could be democratically-operated, but they are not \"democratically *owned*\".\n\nHowever, that was me striking at and criticizing your stated examples. Moving on, I think I've made it fairly clear so far that \"democracy\" is a tool for Socialism, but it can apparently mean a lot of things depending on who's included in it and who's not. I think it really begs the question for why democracy is even really necessary in the first place. I think people fetishize it as being the ultimate realization of egalitarian collectivism, when in reality, in most cases where we employ democracy today, a Socialist or Communist society would simply make it irrelevant. In an anti-state model it wouldn't have its basis in mandating the norms of social life, so political democracy wouldn't really be a thing anymore. In the individual factory, workplace democracy is kind of contentious when you're trying to provision and direct the flow of resources on a world scale, which is rather beyond the conceptual capacity of a few dozen printers (and besides, do people even really need to bother with broad consultation each time someone has to make a decision? In most cases, all direct democracy means is that we vote on the people who handle the managerial aspects of the enterprise, or we vote to recall them). \n\nIn some cases, both democracy and \"authoritarianism\" can be entirely compatible with one another within the same system when the demands arise for it.\n\nA Socialist/Communist system seeks to abolish \"political economy\" entirely. It's true that people would need to work together, consult each other, etc. But does this necessarily imply democracy? Would it always be democracy? In the end, is all you're saying is \"Socialism can use methods of broad consultation\"? Because even its enemies wouldn't necessarily deny that, I think (\"socialism is slavery\", \"mob tyranny\", etc). If we were to say that \"Socialism *is*, or can *be* democracy\", then I would categorically reject that.\n\nAnd for anyone who points out Social-Democracy, that isn't Socialism.\n\nEdit ~ I have my issues with Bordiga, but you might at least find this a thought-provoking read:\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1922/democratic-principle.htm\n\n&gt;The main argument I hear against this is the \"business owners\" take all the risks, so they should be the ones who benefit from this.

I think once you have a certain element of power, risk becomes something that's able to be analyzed and approximated (I think it's been said before that the Fortune 500 companies are effectively the US's \"informal planning committee\" -- the mirror image of the [Soviet Gosplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosplan)). I would suggest instead that we simply shouldn't have an economic system founded upon production for profit and exchange, since this necessitates a relationship where workers have to be continuously deprived of the value they produce, or replaced with machines, in order for that business to remain competitive.

It's arguable that democracy has historically been a model for bourgeois class rule, and that in actuality it represents a \"mystification\" of a process that does nothing but mediate the antagonisms of 'Capital' and 'Labor' and thereby reinforce the Capitalist system. Socialism has no need for such democracy. Democracy in Socialist terms, for \"the class\", can in fact imply a totalitarian apparatus of force and power for the enemies of that class. A revolutionary democracy does not consult with the bourgeoisie, because Socialism seeks to subvert the social relationships of Capitalism and replace them with Socialist/Communist social relationships in \"totality\" -- by force, if necessary.\n\nHowever we'd like to define Socialism, there is one thing we can always agree on; it's anti-Capitalist. Capitalism is understood to be a relationship of production that relies on social \"classes\" (defined by their relationship to the means of production: namely, whether they own the means of production, or do not) to function. It's a relationship of dispossession from the \"forces of production\" (the factories, the machines, the land, the money) which means that the working class, the \"proletariat\", has to sell their labor to survive because they don't have meaningful or direct access to life-needs (in a market economy, we provision our resources from the market, instead of historically growing or producing them ourselves). The Capitalists/bourgeoisie profit off this relationship from owning the forces of production and \"means of subsistence\" and purchasing our labor at a loss (because they have a superior bargaining position). The model you've described, of mass cooperatives, can be very easily construed to in fact be a Capitalist system relying on a Capitalist market-place. In this case, the \"bourgeoisie\" isn't around anymore, but has instead become abstracted into the collective organization that operates the co-op [for profit]. In fact this isn't even that different from corporations in the first place, given that they rarely have a totalitarian despot at their helm but are chaired by shareholders, boards, and union officials, and so on. All co-operatives do is increase the scope of ownership, when **anti-Capitalism has as its historic mission the very abolition of such \"ownership\" as a category.**\n\nThis is why co-ops even exist in the first place under the auspices of the Capitalist system -- they don't reject its fundamental tenets. They in fact embrace the logic of Capitalist exchange (producing things for the purpose of selling them, reducing the costs of labor to remain competitive, produce profits, etc. I think a lot of people that work in co-ops can tell you the experience isn't that great). When people talk about *\"worker ownership of the means of production\"*, **they don't mean co-ops** -- what they mean is that the **means of production should be owned by the working class as a totality**, in that the factories, fields, and human arms should be scaled towards the universal production of items for use-value, to be placed at the dispensation of the entire human race. Not owned \"democratically\" and operated for the profit of the owners, however broad or inclusive. That isn't Socialism. Socialism abolishes private ownership and the commodity. We can say that productive enterprises could be democratically-operated, but they are not \"democratically *owned*\".\n\nHowever, that was me striking at and criticizing your stated examples. Moving on, I think I've made it fairly clear so far that \"democracy\" is a tool for Socialism, but it can apparently mean a lot of things depending on who's included in it and who's not. I think it really begs the question for why democracy is even really necessary in the first place. I think people fetishize it as being the ultimate realization of egalitarian collectivism, when in reality, in most cases where we employ democracy today, a Socialist or Communist society would simply make it irrelevant. In an anti-state model it wouldn't have its basis in mandating the norms of social life, so political democracy wouldn't really be a thing anymore. In the individual factory, workplace democracy is kind of contentious when you're trying to provision and direct the flow of resources on a world scale, which is rather beyond the conceptual capacity of a few dozen printers (and besides, do people even really need to bother with broad consultation each time someone has to make a decision? In most cases, all direct democracy means is that we vote on the people who handle the managerial aspects of the enterprise, or we vote to recall them). \n\nIn some cases, both democracy and \"authoritarianism\" can be entirely compatible with one another within the same system when the demands arise for it.\n\nA Socialist/Communist system seeks to abolish \"political economy\" entirely. It's true that people would need to work together, consult each other, etc. But does this necessarily imply democracy? Would it always be democracy? In the end, is all you're saying is \"Socialism can use methods of broad consultation\"? Because even its enemies wouldn't necessarily deny that, I think (\"socialism is slavery\", \"mob tyranny\", etc). If we were to say that \"Socialism *is*, or can *be* democracy\", then I would categorically reject that.\n\nAnd for anyone who points out Social-Democracy, that isn't Socialism.\n\nEdit ~ I have my issues with Bordiga, but you might at least find this a thought-provoking read:\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1922/democratic-principle.htm\n\n&gt;The main argument I hear against this is the \"business owners\" take all the risks, so they should be the ones who benefit from this. However, I doubt anyone would disagree that just because, say, a senator takes a risk, doesn't mean that they shouldn't be unaccountable to the people, and that if they go against the will should deserve to be impeached.\n\nIt's not an incorrect argument. I would only suggest that \"risk\" shouldn't be a necessary phenomenon -- it relies on the notion that people's businesses and the livelihoods of workers are contingent upon a business's capability to compete in the anarchy of the market-place. Capitalism is systematized destruction and absorption of competition for accumulation. I think once you have a certain element of power, risk becomes something that's able to be analyzed and approximated (I think it's been said before that the Fortune 500 companies are effectively the US's \"informal planning committee\" -- the mirror image of the [Soviet Gosplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosplan)). I would suggest instead that we simply shouldn't have an economic system founded upon production for profit and exchange, since this necessitates a relationship where workers have to be continuously deprived of the value they produce, or replaced with machines, in order for that business to remain competitive. The only ones who are really at \"risk\" are the employees -- they need to survive, and the Capitalist can simply release them from employment on a whim and scale back production if they ever encounter problems. \n\nIn effect, \"risk\" is something framed completely within the logic of Capitalist production and exchange. A Socialist system doesn't have \"risk\" -- aside from an abstract \"risk\" of perhaps not producing at maximum efficiency (which isn't an important goal of Socialism either -- guess who has to be disciplined in order to increase efficiency?). A worker's livelihood isn't, or shouldn't, be invested into their labor and its products (\"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need\")."}, {"id": "cmzc32h", "body": "You seem to understand this really, really well.

Personally I would be careful about indulging too readily in typical media portrayals of what certain places are like. I would categorize Cuba as a relatively repressive state system, but also as one that is able to guarantee a certain standard of living for its citizens. If we just look at things within the logic of Capitalism, even the USSR was a pretty okay place to live after the 60's, given the subsidization of housing, decent medical care, near universal (98%+) levels of employment, and the rising productivity of consumer industries in the Russian core.

One of the most prominent ones historically, I believe, is a system called \"labor vouchers\", which remunerates workers based on the length and intensity of labor (seeking to approximate the \"full value\" of their contribution). The problem with this system is manifold; it's really, really hard to determine how \"hard\" labor is and whether one type of labor is more \"intense\" than another. It can probably be done based on the criteria used, but it would also require very complex systems of accounting and a lot of bureaucratic management to oversee its implementation.\n\nAs a result, the other major suggestion I'm aware of (aside from market socialism, which still utilizes regular old prices) is just \"free appropriation\". Which is to say, if you need something, you just walk to the market/store/\"requisition center\" and just take it.

I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing, but a lot of innovation does seem to improve our quality of life...\n\nI suppose that really depends on what innovation \"is\". I think it's fair to say that people have been innovating long before Capitalism ever came about (or else, how did we get there in the first place?). Technology is for the most part the tools and methods we develop to modify our labor, and make it easier for us to produce what we need to meet our subsistence needs (e.g. developments in agriculture that increased yields, such as the plough, irrigation, domestication, crop rotation, and so on). That's become more abstract today, but I think people have a natural incentive to experiment and develop new things.\n\nI'd have to question whether having things that last longer and which don't need to be replaced as often is a bad thing. I can forsee many cases where it's not, such as in simple machines (like bicycles and laptop chassis, I've had to repair too many of these). I think that innovation in the realm of technology is a different story (and I think we'd be hard pressed to argue that innovation in the medical, astrological sciences, and so on would ever end. There are many dedicated people who are very passionate about these subjects because they're important to our lives and affect many people, and our knowledge on them is constantly evolving). When it comes to technology, I think what usually happens is that people develop new technologies and programs that need increases in power to take full advantage of these new features (my iPhone 4S can barely run iOS 8 these days). And at the same time, research simultaneously develops ways to increase processing efficiency and make chips smaller and faster. There are enormous pressures on these technologies to develop (and in a Communist society that needs advanced computerized planning of resources, I expect these pressures would remain in place). As a result, I have to upgrade my phone as a matter of course, to take advantage of new features. Or maybe I don't need new features (Apple forces upgrades this way too)?\n\nWith that said, though, I think a lot of these transitions to new technology are clumsy and predicated on a desire to profit.

One of the most prominent ones historically, I believe, is a system called \"labor vouchers\", which remunerates workers based on the length and intensity of labor (seeking to approximate the \"full value\" of their contribution). The problem with this system is manifold; it's really, really hard to determine how \"hard\" labor is and whether one type of labor is more \"intense\" than another.

Is that right?\n\nFollowup post. These character limits always kill me, but then, I probably write too much. I'm not too strong on Marxian economic theory, but I think an important contention with prices is what prices are supposed to represent -- not merely a relationship of supply and demand, or a measure of a utility's usefulness, but in fact an abstraction of a commodity's \"exchange value\", or the input costs it took to produce something and the profit that a Capitalist can skim off the top. I think supply and demand is important to some extent or another, and Marx accepts this, but I think he regards price as not actually being a meaningful measure of supply/demand ratio (because let's face it, modern economics is like the electron uncertainty principle, and neat models are never so informative or neat in real life). Price is a useful \"abstraction\" but doesn't actually illuminate to us the ebb-and-flow of the underlying political economy.\n\nOr, actually, don't listen to me. I don't have a lot of time to read things, [but you might find this informative](https://libcom.org/library/marxian-economics-curriculum-1935-iww-work-peoples-college). It's a really compact breakdown of Marxist economics that I transcribed (Section III may be the most relevant). I should read it some more myself. I think probably one of the most important things regarding prices is the relationship that underlies them; the need to to pay for them (e.g. the need to sell one's labor in exchange for currency, which is then used to appropriate products) and the consequences that occur if one doesn't. This is a pretty useful quote about the Watt's Riots that touches upon the nature of commodities briefly:\n\n&gt;\"Looting is a natural response to the unnatural and inhuman society of commodity abundance. It instantly undermines the commodity as such, and it also exposes what the commodity ultimately implies: the army, the police and the other specialized detachments of the state\u2019s monopoly of armed violence. What is a policeman? He is the active servant of the commodity, the man in complete submission to the commodity, whose job is to ensure that a given product of human labor remains a commodity, with the magical property of having to be paid for, instead of becoming a mere refrigerator or rifle \u2014 a passive, inanimate object, subject to anyone who comes along to make use of it.

I'm doing this primarily to answer the OP's question and not soap-box, so I would appreciate it if replies to this remain amicable.\n\nWith that said, I'm afraid that you haven't done very well to define precisely what \"Socialism\" is, which is rather critical when discussing this subject. In Marxian discourse, Marx and Engels tended to use the terms \"Socialism\" and \"Communism\" interchangably -- which rather throws a wrench in your definition of \"Socialism\" as merely being *\"worker ownership of the means of production\"* (since the standard definition of Marxian Communism is \"a stateless, moneyless, classless society\"). I'd regard that definition as being important, albeit incomplete. Even if we look towards Leninism, which defined \"Socialism\" as a concrete, distinct \"stage\" of political and economic organization (as effectively an intermediary stage between Capitalist development and the realization of Communism proper), that definition doesn't fully describe the nuance of this conception. You have to note that both of these models reject the notion of \"private property\" and thereby private accumulation as well -- two central hallmarks of Capitalism.\n\nDemocracy is, in fact, an important component of Communism, particularly during a revolutionary period, whichever way you look at it. However, it would be disingenuous to not admit that \"democracy\" is not primarily what Socialism/Communism is interested in realizing, and that it's really only a useful component or instrument in the process. For instance we can talk about democracy -- but democracy for who, anyway? Certainly not Capitalists, who would find themselves excluded from this process until such a time as they're destroyed as a class power. It's arguable that democracy has historically been a model for bourgeois class rule, and that in actuality it represents a \"mystification\" of a process that does nothing but mediate the antagonisms of 'Capital' and 'Labor' and thereby reinforce the Capitalist system. Socialism has no need for such democracy. Democracy in Socialist terms, for \"the class\", can in fact imply a totalitarian apparatus of force and power for the enemies of that class. A revolutionary democracy does not consult with the bourgeoisie, because Socialism seeks to subvert the social relationships of Capitalism and replace them with Socialist/Communist social relationships in \"totality\" -- by force, if necessary.\n\nHowever we'd like to define Socialism, there is one thing we can always agree on; it's anti-Capitalist. Capitalism is understood to be a relationship of production that relies on social \"classes\" (defined by their relationship to the means of production: namely, whether they own the means of production, or do not) to function. It's a relationship of dispossession from the \"forces of production\" (the factories, the machines, the land, the money) which means that the working class, the \"proletariat\", has to sell their labor to survive because they don't have meaningful or direct access to life-needs (in a market economy, we provision our resources from the market, instead of historically growing or producing them ourselves). The Capitalists/bourgeoisie profit off this relationship from owning the forces of production and \"means of subsistence\" and purchasing our labor at a loss (because they have a superior bargaining position). The model you've described, of mass cooperatives, can be very easily construed to in fact be a Capitalist system relying on a Capitalist market-place. In this case, the \"bourgeoisie\" isn't around anymore, but has instead become abstracted into the collective organization that operates the co-op [for profit]. In fact this isn't even that different from corporations in the first place, given that they rarely have a totalitarian despot at their helm but are chaired by shareholders, boards, and union officials, and so on. All co-operatives do is increase the scope of ownership, when **anti-Capitalism has as its historic mission the very abolition of such \"ownership\" as a category.**\n\nThis is why co-ops even exist in the first place under the auspices of the Capitalist system -- they don't reject its fundamental tenets. They in fact embrace the logic of Capitalist exchange (producing things for the purpose of selling them, reducing the costs of labor to remain competitive, produce profits, etc. I think a lot of people that work in co-ops can tell you the experience isn't that great). When people talk about *\"worker ownership of the means of production\"*, **they don't mean co-ops** -- what they mean is that the **means of production should be owned by the working class as a totality**, in that the factories, fields, and human arms should be scaled towards the universal production of items for use-value, to be placed at the dispensation of the entire human race. Not owned \"democratically\" and operated for the profit of the owners, however broad or inclusive. That isn't Socialism. Socialism abolishes private ownership and the commodity. We can say that productive enterprises could be democratically-operated, but they are not \"democratically *owned*\".\n\nHowever, that was me striking at and criticizing your stated examples. Moving on, I think I've made it fairly clear so far that \"democracy\" is a tool for Socialism, but it can apparently mean a lot of things depending on who's included in it and who's not. I think it really begs the question for why democracy is even really necessary in the first place. I think people fetishize it as being the ultimate realization of egalitarian collectivism, when in reality, in most cases where we employ democracy today, a Socialist or Communist society would simply make it irrelevant. In an anti-state model it wouldn't have its basis in mandating the norms of social life, so political democracy wouldn't really be a thing anymore. In the individual factory, workplace democracy is kind of contentious when you're trying to provision and direct the flow of resources on a world scale, which is rather beyond the conceptual capacity of a few dozen printers (and besides, do people even really need to bother with broad consultation each time someone has to make a decision? In most cases, all direct democracy means is that we vote on the people who handle the managerial aspects of the enterprise, or we vote to recall them). \n\nIn some cases, both democracy and \"authoritarianism\" can be entirely compatible with one another within the same system when the demands arise for it.\n\nA Socialist/Communist system seeks to abolish \"political economy\" entirely. It's true that people would need to work together, consult each other, etc. But does this necessarily imply democracy? Would it always be democracy? In the end, is all you're saying is \"Socialism can use methods of broad consultation\"? Because even its enemies wouldn't necessarily deny that, I think (\"socialism is slavery\", \"mob tyranny\", etc). If we were to say that \"Socialism *is*, or can *be* democracy\", then I would categorically reject that.\n\nAnd for anyone who points out Social-Democracy, that isn't Socialism.\n\nEdit ~ I have my issues with Bordiga, but you might at least find this a thought-provoking read:\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1922/democratic-principle.htm\n\n&gt;The main argument I hear against this is the \"business owners\" take all the risks, so they should be the ones who benefit from this. However, I doubt anyone would disagree that just because, say, a senator takes a risk, doesn't mean that they shouldn't be unaccountable to the people, and that if they go against the will should deserve to be impeached.\n\nIt's not an incorrect argument. I would only suggest that \"risk\" shouldn't be a necessary phenomenon -- it relies on the notion that people's businesses and the livelihoods of workers are contingent upon a business's capability to compete in the anarchy of the market-place. Capitalism is systematized destruction and absorption of competition for accumulation. I think once you have a certain element of power, risk becomes something that's able to be analyzed and approximated (I think it's been said before that the Fortune 500 companies are effectively the US's \"informal planning committee\" -- the mirror image of the [Soviet Gosplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosplan)). I would suggest instead that we simply shouldn't have an economic system founded upon production for profit and exchange, since this necessitates a relationship where workers have to be continuously deprived of the value they produce, or replaced with machines, in order for that business to remain competitive. The only ones who are really at \"risk\" are the employees -- they need to survive, and the Capitalist can simply release them from employment on a whim and scale back production if they ever encounter problems. \n\nIn effect, \"risk\" is something framed completely within the logic of Capitalist production and exchange. A Socialist system doesn't have \"risk\" -- aside from an abstract \"risk\" of perhaps not producing at maximum efficiency (which isn't an important goal of Socialism either -- guess who has to be disciplined in order to increase efficiency?). A worker's livelihood isn't, or shouldn't, be invested into their labor and its products (\"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need\")."}, {"id": "cmzjn1r", "body": "Isn't this the philosophy that basically guided the USSR and other 20th century states?

One of the drawbacks of a worker cooperative in which a company is owned by its employees is that the employees suffer much greater consequences if the company fails. When workers do not have a stake in the company they work for, if the business fails they will only lose their jobs. While that's unfortunate, it's not nearly as bad as also losing their stock in the company, which is often a significant portion of their net worth. A publicly traded company gives people the option of buying or selling company stock according to how much risk they're willing to take. It can be beneficial to everyone for a business to be owned by wealthier individuals who have less to lose if it fails while its employees sacrifice control for security.\n\nIt's true that security nets help mitigate this problem, but they can only do so much. Ensuring that people don't go without food, housing, or medical care is better than nothing, but people in developed countries want to strive for much more than that. People who've worked for years to earn a comfortable middle class lifestyle don't want to see it vanish the moment the market turns against them, and safety nets can't do much for people who've had their savings obliterated.\n\nI'm all for worker cooperatives being an option, but there are good reasons why people might not want to participate in them. It shouldn't be encouraged unconditionally."}, {"id": "2pqdi4", "body": "Socialism can be defined as an economic system where the workers own, control, and manage their own workshops, factories, restaurants, etc. Rather than having a boss in charge who dictates everything, the workers would exert democratic control over the direction of the company.

But I think you may be underestimating how oppressive it would be to be robbed of the kind of basic economic freedom to choose what kind of work a person does for a living - how they spend the bulk of their life. This is not just the inconvenience of having to sign up for a permit or to have limits on much pollution your factory can emit. You are talking about a system where people wouldn't be allowed the freedom to start a company on their own, work as a freelancer and possibly not have individual ownership of intellectual property and ideas.\n\nYou are also assuming that people would vote to sacrifice this freedom rather than having it imposed on them, something that I'm a little skeptical of in a society where greater freedom is more and more valued.\n\nWould such a system still be democracy?

This means that if the user wants more drugs they have to go to the servo dealer. This means that the dealer has no motivation to provide quality product, they actually have the opposite motivation.

Essentially, drugs and drug addiction should be a public health issue, not a legal issue.\n\nWhen a person is addicted to something, their brain literally rewrites its connections. This happens not only with drugs like heroin and cocaine, but also happens with the kind of general dopamine addictions that Satan talked to Stan about in the recent episode of South Park about Freemium gaming. Because of this, addiction should be treated as a health issue. If someone is an addict, they are sick, and are very likely unable to help themselves in any significant way. \n\nTreating it as a legal issue doesn't help anything. Prison sucks, and even with all the restrictions, drugs still make their way into them due to corruption, so busting people for buying drugs, even seriously deadly drugs like the ones you identified, doesn't help anything.\n\n&gt;I would love to see these hard drugs off the streets\n\nEveryone would. Unfortunately, history shows that attacking suppliers doesn't help much, because, like you identified, if there is a demand, there will always be a supply. So the best solution, in my view, is to attack the demand problem by treating addiction as a medical issue, as well as giving the public genuine information about these substances and what they do. After all, for decades Marijuana was demonized on complete BS. It was made illegal largely due to an argument made before congress that included such wonderful assertions like [it being evil for making white women dance with black men.](http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/10550/Marijuana-was-made-illegal-in-1937-by-a-man-who-testified-that-the-drug-made-white-women-want-to-be-with-black-guys). When people try something relatively harmless like marijuana and realize they've been lied to about it for years, it's easier to jump into experimenting with more serious substances, at least in my view.\n\nSo yeah, what we really need is proper education and better access to help for those who are addicted, not more people in jail."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2ppxgu", "body": "So, I've been a regular reddit user for several years, and one of the more controversial communities on here is SRS, or ShitRedditSays. It highlights a range of content that is racist, sexist, or generally offensive that is regularly upvoted and validated by significant portions of the reddit community. Things that can and do reach the front page(or are tangentially connected to it through things like the comments of such threads).\n\nNow, the largest complaint I see is that the community is a \"hate group\", which seems a bit silly to me. Who are they discriminating against? White Males? As far as I know, that's what the majority of the community is composed of.\n\nSecondly, often times the content they highlight are offensive jokes, and these statements are defended with statements like \"its just a joke.\" This makes the accusation that SRS is a hate group to me even stranger, given that the vast majority of the comments in the comment section tend to be similar jokes, just at the expense of those who mocked the disadvantaged(or and assumed image of them). Can those who like making jokes at the expense of others not take what they dish out?\n\nThirdly, and probably most importantly, SRS is, in my view, a very necessary force of balance. People like to say they are a force of censorship, but I don't agree with that. First and foremost, for all the complaints about brigading, very few of the content they highlight is downvoted into obscurity. Beyond that, Freedom of Speech is only guaranteed by the US Government, but not by private companies like Reddit, or massive populations like Reddit's user base. Being downvoted isn't censorship. You expressed your sentiment, and the community rejected it. Nothing was denied beyond validation. Reddit is an immensely useful medium and interface for connecting to people all over the world, and it receives new users every day. When memes like Opinion Puffin basically degenerate into a way for people to seek validation for racist and sexist beliefs, and this stuff gets upvoted to the front page from being on one of the sites most populated subs, it can give the wrong idea as to what kind of community actually uses this site, or give someone a good reason for not joining, which is sad, because social connection is exactly what Reddit was obviously designed to foster.\n\nAnyway, those are my main reasons for my current position. Other stuff may come up in the discussion, but this should be enough to at least get the ball rolling. For the sake of acknowledging the other side of this debate, I do understand they have a history of doxxing that is controversial, but my knowledge of those instances are pretty hazy, so someone more familiar with what happened there can maybe shed some light on it that could change my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If it were a serious place were racist/sexist comments could be discussed &amp; debated while regarding the context and nuances it would be great. But it isn't. It's a cesspit of low effort posts, where any dissenting opinion is removed (this is why probably call it censoring) and everyone circlejerks in this sort of internet meme language.\n\nIt's an *awful* implementation of a good idea and I don't think that makes it a 'good thing', whatever that means exactly.\n"}, {"id": "cmz8lk2", "body": "Well, it *is* a circlejerk subreddit only.

They force you to either ignore them or simply accept at face value the emotions of another person as a judgement of something. If anyone feels, entirely subjectively,  that something offended them, then it is offensive and no debate is allowed.\n\nThis is frustrating for me, becasue although I agree with being tough on racism and sexism, I don't think calling someone an idiot is ableist, nor that this kind of ableism is in any way wrong.\n\nThe issue is,  I cannot debate this. On all their subreddits, they ban debate, they just want to \"educate\" or \"explain\" but not debate. Plain simply anything that questions if they are correct is banned.\n\nI think they do this because they want a \"safe space\" (how can be people so fragile?), but for everybody else, this comes accross as either arrogant or having so ridiculously fragile egos that amounts to some kind of mental illness (oops, ableist again) so in that case the wrong is with them and not other people.

It made me feel like a villain, and even though my friend was more reasonable in her request, it invoked flashbacks to my black sheep days in the family household.\n\nThis inspired an argument, wherein I argued that I don't care if people judge me for my language choice in public.  If you enter into private property, it's appropriate to censor your language according to the preferences of the host, but in public you should feel free to be yourself and learn to respect other's differences.  \n\nShe accused me of not caring about other people's feelings, because I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.  If someone doesn't like a curse word simply because it alludes, in the abstract, to something literal which by their belief system is crude and inappropriate, that is an affront which is, in my view, not genuinely hurtful or harmful.\n\nI make an exception for words which could be construed as a personal attack, such as racist, sexist or homophobic terminology.  If someone hears me using words like b#tch, n#gger or f#g, they may feel **personally** attacked because such words have historically been used to judge and denigrate who they are as individuals.\n\nMy friend contends that there is no difference.  She argues that if a civilized person is offended by an inelegant term, then it is personal.  Their feelings about polite etiquette are as valid as someone else's pride in who they are.  She is also of the camp that children should be protected from language because \"it takes a village to raise a child\". I challenged her to explain how \"bad\" words could hurt a child. She said it makes the world seem like an angry place.  \n\n(Interestingly, she tends to interpret the world through a lens of fear that I don't.  Point in case: I showed her a dance routine on youtube by LesTwins which I found wonderfully playful.  She thought the dance was representing a scene of violence.)\n\nI told my friend that it was unfair of her to restrict my behavior so that *she* wouldn't be judged for it.  She says it's unfair of me to disregard her and other people's feelings.  It seems that we can't come to terms on this issue, because we have a fundamental difference of opinion.\n\ntl;dr: I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.

If someone hears me using words like b#tch, n#gger or f#g, they may feel **personally** attacked because such words have historically been used to judge and denigrate who they are as individuals.\n\nMy friend contends that there is no difference.  She argues that if a civilized person is offended by an inelegant term, then it is personal.  Their feelings about polite etiquette are as valid as someone else's pride in who they are.  She is also of the camp that children should be protected from language because \"it takes a village to raise a child\". I challenged her to explain how \"bad\" words could hurt a child. She said it makes the world seem like an angry place.  \n\n(Interestingly, she tends to interpret the world through a lens of fear that I don't.  Point in case: I showed her a dance routine on youtube by LesTwins which I found wonderfully playful.  She thought the dance was representing a scene of violence.)\n\nI told my friend that it was unfair of her to restrict my behavior so that *she* wouldn't be judged for it.  She says it's unfair of me to disregard her and other people's feelings.  It seems that we can't come to terms on this issue, because we have a fundamental difference of opinion.\n\ntl;dr: I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.

Often a bit of rational thinking is all one really needs to grow out of needlessly being offended.  Like a racist person who realizes that they're wasting a whole lot of energy over a simple evolutionary melanin quotient, and learn to stop caring.  I'm not suggesting that it's easy, but I'm unconvinced that this degree of slight is damaging enough to warrant censorship.

It's that feeling of constantly having to watch your words and behavior so as not to offend someone.  It's not easy at all.  It's a chronic tension which different people experience to varying degrees according to the company they keep.  I've spent, and spend, a lot of my life suppressing things, keeping things quiet, \"staying in the closet\", so to speak.  I've peaked - I'm exhausted by it.  I'm ready to be my authentic self, damn the consequences, so long as I'm not hurting anybody by doing so.  If we are going to count sleight embarrassments as hurting, then we may as well all go back in the closet because someone's ALWAYS going to be offended by SOMEthing.\n\nYou and I just have a different opinion of the cost of self-suppression, or the point at which it becomes excessive.\n\n&gt;When it's easy and free for you to make the world a slightly better place for the people who share it with you, do the right thing and take that opportunity.\n\nI do.

She's visibly embarrassed.\n\nI've used this kind of language with her before, even though, at 30+, she still uses euphemisms like \"poop\" and only recently realized that \"maroon\" was a stand-in for moron.  We're both adults, and she's never indicated that she minded.  But apparently she minds when other people are around, because they may judge her for it.\n\nThis trivial issue turns out to be a highly sensitive one.  My father used to slam his fists on the table and completely shut down a previously happy conversation if I accidentally let a \"bad\" word slip.  It made me feel like a villain, and even though my friend was more reasonable in her request, it invoked flashbacks to my black sheep days in the family household.\n\nThis inspired an argument, wherein I argued that I don't care if people judge me for my language choice in public.  If you enter into private property, it's appropriate to censor your language according to the preferences of the host, but in public you should feel free to be yourself and learn to respect other's differences.  \n\nShe accused me of not caring about other people's feelings, because I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.  If someone doesn't like a curse word simply because it alludes, in the abstract, to something literal which by their belief system is crude and inappropriate, that is an affront which is, in my view, not genuinely hurtful or harmful.\n\nI make an exception for words which could be construed as a personal attack, such as racist, sexist or homophobic terminology.  If someone hears me using words like b#tch, n#gger or f#g, they may feel **personally** attacked because such words have historically been used to judge and denigrate who they are as individuals.\n\nMy friend contends that there is no difference.  She argues that if a civilized person is offended by an inelegant term, then it is personal.  Their feelings about polite etiquette are as valid as someone else's pride in who they are.  She is also of the camp that children should be protected from language because \"it takes a village to raise a child\". I challenged her to explain how \"bad\" words could hurt a child. She said it makes the world seem like an angry place.  \n\n(Interestingly, she tends to interpret the world through a lens of fear that I don't.  Point in case: I showed her a dance routine on youtube by LesTwins which I found wonderfully playful.  She thought the dance was representing a scene of violence.)\n\nI told my friend that it was unfair of her to restrict my behavior so that *she* wouldn't be judged for it.  She says it's unfair of me to disregard her and other people's feelings.  It seems that we can't come to terms on this issue, because we have a fundamental difference of opinion.\n\ntl;dr: I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.

A person may be offended at such a word, whether or not the person saying it means to be offensive or not.  The \"offense\" is in the connotation of the word itself.  Offense doesn't need to be intended, the word itself carries the offense.  (Not the literal word, but the shared understanding of it.)\n\nThe word is a messenger of a thought, and the message it carries is one of offensiveness.  That's *why* the word exists.\n\nSwear words are not different.  They are deemed by society to carry connotations of obscenity, vulgarity, or blasphemy and as such are offensive.\n\nYou don't have to mean it to be offensive, and it doesn't have to be personal.\n\nCan a white person be legitimately offended at the word \"nigger\"?  You aren't directing it at them!  Of course they can.  Your intentions aren't *completely* irrelevant, I am not saying that, but the use of the word is offensive, *by default*.\n\nIf you say \"fuck\" you might not be directing it at a person, you might not mean to offend them, but here's the key: you obviously aren't intending to NOT offend them.\n\nThey hear you use a word that you know society says is offensive, and they know that you at the very least don't *mind* offending them... if nothing else, *that* is offensive!  Even outside the fact that many find such words offensive because they find obscenity, vulgarity, or blasphemy offensive.  And others find the words offensive for no other reason than just because the connotation carries offense with it.\n\nThat's why there is a difference between \"poop\" and \"shit.\"  They both mean feces, but \"shit\" carries with it a more vulgar connotation.  Kids can say poop, but not shit.  \"Shit\" is *supposed* to be more offensive, that's *why* it exists as a separate word.  There is a *purpose* for offensive words.\n\nSo it's a little disingenuous to use a word society has kept around specifically to *be* offensive and then act like people are unreasonable for being offended.\n\nThe words may not offend you personally, but language is shared.  The fact is, no one says \"hey don't say fuck, it offends me\" and expects you to say \"Wow, really?  I had no idea that was a bad word.\"  You know it is a \"bad\" word and everyone knows you know... why?  Because society, not some tiny minority of prudes you don't have to give a shit about, has agreed those words carry offensiveness with them, whether you want them to or not.\n\nAnd if you truly didn't want to offend... you could use different words.  Your use of them anyway is a signal that you are an asshole, sorry I mean insensitive to others' feelings, but what difference should that make, eh?"}, {"id": "2pprlq", "body": "I work in an office with my best friend, whom I met on the job.  Every day we get a ten minute break and take a walk around our corporate block.  I've been waiting all morning to tell my friend an anecdote that had occurred on the previous evening, and since we both sit stifling in silence at our desks the rest of the day, I get very expressive and animated in the telling.  I drop a couple of sh#ts and f#ckings for emphasis at the height of my tale, and my friend disrupts me to ask me not to use that language because there are other people nearby.  She's visibly embarrassed.\n\nI've used this kind of language with her before, even though, at 30+, she still uses euphemisms like \"poop\" and only recently realized that \"maroon\" was a stand-in for moron.  We're both adults, and she's never indicated that she minded.  But apparently she minds when other people are around, because they may judge her for it.\n\nThis trivial issue turns out to be a highly sensitive one.  My father used to slam his fists on the table and completely shut down a previously happy conversation if I accidentally let a \"bad\" word slip.  It made me feel like a villain, and even though my friend was more reasonable in her request, it invoked flashbacks to my black sheep days in the family household.\n\nThis inspired an argument, wherein I argued that I don't care if people judge me for my language choice in public.  If you enter into private property, it's appropriate to censor your language according to the preferences of the host, but in public you should feel free to be yourself and learn to respect other's differences.  \n\nShe accused me of not caring about other people's feelings, because I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.  If someone doesn't like a curse word simply because it alludes, in the abstract, to something literal which by their belief system is crude and inappropriate, that is an affront which is, in my view, not genuinely hurtful or harmful.\n\nI make an exception for words which could be construed as a personal attack, such as racist, sexist or homophobic terminology.  If someone hears me using words like b#tch, n#gger or f#g, they may feel **personally** attacked because such words have historically been used to judge and denigrate who they are as individuals.\n\nMy friend contends that there is no difference.  She argues that if a civilized person is offended by an inelegant term, then it is personal.  Their feelings about polite etiquette are as valid as someone else's pride in who they are.  She is also of the camp that children should be protected from language because \"it takes a village to raise a child\". I challenged her to explain how \"bad\" words could hurt a child. She said it makes the world seem like an angry place.  \n\n(Interestingly, she tends to interpret the world through a lens of fear that I don't.  Point in case: I showed her a dance routine on youtube by LesTwins which I found wonderfully playful.  She thought the dance was representing a scene of violence.)\n\nI told my friend that it was unfair of her to restrict my behavior so that *she* wouldn't be judged for it.  She says it's unfair of me to disregard her and other people's feelings.  It seems that we can't come to terms on this issue, because we have a fundamental difference of opinion.\n\ntl;dr: I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.

I use 300-350 GB / month. My \"Math\" in assuming UBB based on the actual cost per GB is a bad idea is thus:\n\n* The valuation of a Gigabyte is based on AVERAGES. Therefore, even if we are allowed to go up to some high number, the cost per gigabyte assumes most people don't get close to this number.\n\n* Verizon's FIOS network is ~50% utilized. Let us assume all telecoms are similar. \n\n* According to Comcast, less than 5% of their users hit the \"Cap\" (that they don't enforce) of 250GB.\n\n* [This article](http://www.thestreet.com/story/12963832/1/home-netflix-use-continues-its-ascension.html) says the average person uses 20GB per month. Assuming 20GB per month, there are only [on average 2.6 persons per household](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html) which means the average household uses 52 GB, but let's be generous and say **60GB/customer**.\n\n* So, the network would be at-capacity if people doubled their usage, or would be effectively at capacity at around 100GB/customer. \n\n* Based on that logic, and assuming we are at the status quo for industry profits, my Internet is worth $0.50 a GB because I have a $50 bill because the lower users have been subsidizing my activity. So, **I should be paying $150-$175 if I was being \"Fair\" to the average user**.\n\n* Even if infrastructure, support, personnel, etc was 1/3 the revenue the rest all being profit, I would still have a higher bill.\n\nNow, we can argue back and forth that network capacity != data, but the only way Usage-Based billing makes sense is basically only to impose it during peak traffic times. But, what is a gigabyte worth during non-peak times vs peak times? If we're striving for innovation of the internet, **imposing fees for using your service during prime-time peak usage would do far more to harm the internet than data caps**.\n\nWe can also argue back and forth that the cable companies wasted their money from the public sector. Erase tat from the argument and let us look forward to how to handle the internet and financial policy in the future. I think they should be increasing network capacity, data caps over time which hasn't happened.\n\n\nPlease, CMV, because I think Comcast is right about something *shudder and that 50GB/$10 if I was to go over my \"cap\" is completely reasonable. \n\n**TL;DR: I think Comcast is generous with their proposed Usage-Based billing policies.**\n\n**EDIT:** I just want to acknowledged that my calculation of what a gigabyte costs can be off, but my core argument of Usage-Based Billing is based on the ratio of how much traffic I use as compared to the average person, so therefore I should be paying like 10x the average customer. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Its a pretty simple Nash equilibrium problem. Giving in has reinforced the idea that if you hack into a company's files and leak a lot of shit about their company, they will give in to your demands and will take your threats seriously. This means the perps can reasonably expect success if they do the same thing next week to another company. If Sony had released the movie anyway, it would be saying that we don't find their threat credible/they haven't done enough to force companies into certain decisions. As a result, they may not take the risk hacking another company if they realize that the benefits will be low.. pretty much no benefit to them, just hurting another company. \n\nI [drew it out](http://i.imgur.com/8ioWbiT.jpg?1) to show what I'm trying to say. With Sony, you didn't know what would happen if they were hacked and still released the movie. Maybe it would have been -1000000000 and holocaust ensued. However, the government would want to show strength in handling a terrorist threat like this, so they would have done everything possible to eliminate any additional threat. If Sony released the movie, we would know for sure what actually happened. Would NK do something? Would Sony/the United States profit from it (revenue to movie theater and people enjoying movie) or lost from it? We don't know. But we do know that in that case, NK's objective would have failed: the movie would have gone out and people would have seen it.\n\nNow the \"after\" effect. We'd know if this happened again how to react IF the movie had been originally released assuming we could form reasonably accurate assumptions based on the outcome of the first event. If you give in to the threats, you set a precedent that is extremely difficult to overcome. A future company would be under a lot of pressure to give in as well because if threats did go bad, the company would be blamed for going against precedent and things going bad. Thus, future companies will be under societal pressure to NOT release the product and they will necessarily hurt from that, while (assuming they aren't releasing it BECAUSE they've been hacked), North Korea would win again and again in the future.\n\nSo this is why people say the precedent is bad. When you give in to threats once, people get more and more comfortable with giving in if future threats come up. \n\nIn all fairness, it might be the right decision. Maybe a bunch of things would go terribly terribly wrong and the ? in my drawing would be a big negative number. But we'll never know now and are basically forced into a pattern unless the government can prove it can stop the threats from coming true."}, {"id": "2pp8dz", "body": "So much of this conversation is so full of horseshit that I can barely read about it anymore. \n\n\"America\" didn't give in to terrorists, a Japanese multinational media conglomerate did, as they have every right to. \n\n\"America\" did not lose its first cyberwar, a private sector company chose not to further incite maniac terrorists, as is their right to do.\n\nThis still sucks, obviously, but this isn't about our personal liberties being taken away, nor is it about America giving in to foreign powers' demands.\n\nBut Newt Gingrich and his horde of idiots want to use this to paint Obama as weak in the face of terror, so that's the narrative they're pushing and a disappointingly large number of people are picking up the baton.\n\nSo, uh... change my view."}, {"id": "cmyqm99", "body": "Nah, I disagree.\n\n\nI think this whole thing with is just a test for the masses and to confirm or deny the flock mentality.

It almost never serves any useful purpose.

So some particular asshole mods of some particular subreddit might be \"censoring\" you out of a perverse motive of persecution. So?\n\nFinally: our rules are rather vague in many cases, and simply require judgement calls. It is, for example, intrinsically impossible to reach inside someone's mind through the internet and measure whether they are \"soapboxing\".
