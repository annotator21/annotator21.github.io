This article does a better job\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness"}, {"id": "2q0t1n", "body": "I'm a 33 year old male and I eventually want to have a happy family and children. Although I'm in no rush, I have been getting more serious about it recently, and really thinking about whats important to me. I have concluded that looks are the most important thing to me in a mate, not because I am superficial or shallow, but because I believe that looks are the best indicator of ones overall health, intellect, and the types of choices they make. Let me elaborate...\n\nFirst off, let me clarify that \"looks\" is both subjective and objective/universal. There are certain things like reasonable symmetry, youth (prime fertility), and good health that most people find attractive. Other things are completely subjective like race, hair color, body type, etc.... \n\nI think \"beauty\" is the default trigger of male attraction to females by nature, and for good reason. Beauty signals health, fertility, good genes, intellect, good decision making, and the subjective part of looks probably has something to do with traits that blend well with my own genes.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want my children to be healthy, intelligent, athletic, loving etc... I believe that what a person looks like on the outside is a pretty accurate indication of what they are like on the inside. There are always exceptions to the rule, like injured/diseased people etc, but I feel that this is generally true.\n\nContinuing on with why looks are important to me:\n\nYouth: Prime fertility for women is between 20 and 35. I have always found women in their mid twenties to early thirties to be the most attractive. This coincides with high fertility zones with women, increasing the chances of conception and lowering the risk of birth defects.\n\nSymmetry: I'm not huge on this but facial symmetry is a decent indicator of good genes as shown in scientific studies.\n\nBody type: I am attracted to fit, curvy women. This is more of a subjective thing when it comes to looks however there is science behind it. I'm not attracted to rail thin women or overly ripped women, and its been shown that women with body fat too low don't menstruate and are less fertile. I'm also not attracted to overweight women, which is a signal of poor impulse control, possible hormonal abnormalities, lower intellect, or other things which I would not want my children to inherit. I am attracted to curves, and both large breasts and bubble butt appear to be sexual fertility signals on an otherwise fit and healthy woman. Boobs indicate a woman can feed newborns and the shape/size/etc of the butt possibly indicates fitness levels that may be related to sex and procreation.\n\nIntellect: I feel that you can read people through their eyes and body language even more so than you can with words. These are both subsets of \"looks\". It has been said that most communication is nonverbal. You can often tell how people are wired from how they look. Perhaps they are book smart but socially inept, or incapable of abstract thought but extremely socially savvy, etc. Looks hint at how peoples brains functions. \n\nDisposition: I feel that a persons disposition, whether they are loving or vicious, compassionate or heartless can be read through their looks. This is something that is more complicated however and may not be apparent at first glance. It may take a long time and multiple encounters with someone to be able to read how their looks convey their disposition.\n\nSo to finish, looks are the most important thing to me. And by looks I don't mean the objectified woman who most men agree is the hottest thing ever. By looks I mean my own subjective attraction to how a particular woman appears and the message her appearance conveys to me. Perhaps most men are like this, because when most men tell their wife she's beautiful they are being honest, subjectively. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Success in today's society can be attributed just as much if not more to intelligence, motivation, and the ability to excel socially. Physical appearance has good correlation to good health, but it's not 100%. Unattractive people can artificially increase their attractiveness, and traditionally good-looking people can still have a variety of diseases and genetic inadequacies, not to mention qualities that hinder them socially in today's society. \n\nIf you're maximizing number of offspring, you can stand to be wrong some of the time. But if you're only investing in a few, you have the time to gather more information about your mate and you're doing yourself a disservice to prioritize looks above all other information.\n"}, {"id": "cn2m3yz", "body": "Very good post, thankyou"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2q0mlm", "body": "[Some](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Withershins_\\(Book\\)) of the books are pretty [enjoyable](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Chance%27s_Folly) or just [silly](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/ABCs_for_Barbarians) and knowing a little bit about the relevant culture can be useful (more so in Morrowind than Oblivion or Skyrim) but some people get waaaay into it.

We are generally considered a social animal, but are even able to survive on our own by hunting, gathering, growing/farming (recent), planning, etc... It is through working together in groups that we advanced and different activities for survival became distributed to different people to make things more efficient.\n\nToday, it is jobs that make society work. But as technology progresses it takes less jobs to accomplish similar productivity. If this trend is to continue, there will be less and less jobs required but more and more productivity. Eventually, most things should become far more efficient if not outright automated. This means jobs will become a thing of the past. We are already seeing this happen in todays world with corporate profits higher than ever, yet people unable to find jobs to support themselves. The situation will only get worse as technology and productivity improves.\n\nNow you could argue that as jobs are replaced, new jobs are created. But if something is more efficient, that means you are getting more productivity from less work. That means you are replacing 10 manufacturing jobs with 1 engineering job, 1 scientist job, 1 controller job, 1 sales job, and perhaps 5 robotics and computer software programs. This will continue and 10 scientists will be replaced by 1 scientist and 10 engineer by 1 engineer.\n\nSo inherently, the concept of job is flawed. If we had perfect efficiency, that was near pure automation, then relying on jobs for income wouldnt work because corporations would not need any employees, or very few. So what is the end game then?

If robots can *independently* own and operate businesses, then they are effectively members of society.\n\nIf you actually mean robots/computers are automating the process of running a business (arguably, a necessary step to get to the above), then this will aid entrepreneurship, as it's cheaper to buy code than it is to hire a CEO."}, {"id": "2q0f12", "body": "If you go back to our most primitive roots, the only real job we ever had as humans is to survive. We are generally considered a social animal, but are even able to survive on our own by hunting, gathering, growing/farming (recent), planning, etc... It is through working together in groups that we advanced and different activities for survival became distributed to different people to make things more efficient.\n\nToday, it is jobs that make society work. But as technology progresses it takes less jobs to accomplish similar productivity. If this trend is to continue, there will be less and less jobs required but more and more productivity. Eventually, most things should become far more efficient if not outright automated. This means jobs will become a thing of the past. We are already seeing this happen in todays world with corporate profits higher than ever, yet people unable to find jobs to support themselves. The situation will only get worse as technology and productivity improves.\n\nNow you could argue that as jobs are replaced, new jobs are created. But if something is more efficient, that means you are getting more productivity from less work. That means you are replacing 10 manufacturing jobs with 1 engineering job, 1 scientist job, 1 controller job, 1 sales job, and perhaps 5 robotics and computer software programs. This will continue and 10 scientists will be replaced by 1 scientist and 10 engineer by 1 engineer.\n\nSo inherently, the concept of job is flawed. If we had perfect efficiency, that was near pure automation, then relying on jobs for income wouldnt work because corporations would not need any employees, or very few. So what is the end game then? Its certainly not jobs.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

That equates to 2-3 million people, which is far from enough. \n\nThere is a chance that some new revolution will come around, but it's just that. A chance. We've already taken over the physical labor jobs. When those became automated we moved to intelligence based jobs. The white collar labor force was born. But when those jobs can be replaced by one self-learning program, where do we go next? Maybe there is something, somewhere, but it's not a given that it'll be coming around in time. \n\nHere's the CGPgrey video on the subject (I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't already linked somewhere on this post): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU\n\nEDIT: Formatting\n"}, {"id": "cn21ork", "body": "The industrial and current mechanical automation revolution is about eliminating the need for physical human labor.

If we believe that the government overwhelmingly improves our own conditions, as I do, then only a small amount of citizens would opt out of public services because they disagree with certain elements of policy.

Okay, just purely the logistics here... how can you *know* who has and has not yet paid off taxes? As it is, the IRS doesn't step in to check until Q1 every year, so you'd basically need to restructure that whole system. When a crime or fire is reported, they'd have to somehow cross reference who is in the building at the time, and if they have or haven't paid taxes, but also, if there's a criminal or a fire, emergency services has to go in and deal with it anyway because otherwise more people could be affected, and more houses could burn down, some of those perhaps even being taxpayers. What would happen if someone who pays their taxes co-rents with a non-taxpayer, or a non-taxpayer lives in a house being rented out by a taxpayer? What happens if they respond and then find out the person hasn't paid taxes... if they had to fine the person for \"wasting taxpayer money\" on their issues, how is that any different really than our current compulsory tax system? What about roads and other public works that are made with taxpayer dollars for everyone to use... aren't they getting abused by the non-taxpayers here?\n\nAnd finally, look at all of the above and think of the moral dilemma. That someone could decide whether or not you have the right to be protected and cared for by police, fireman, EMTs... why should that even be an option? Really this seems like it would actually do more harm to taxpayers because then this system would be another point-of-failure where innocent taxpayers mistaken as non-taxpayers don't get treated as paid for... but also, they're public servants. They're meant to do good for all of us. They're meant to help everyone as a service of goodwill towards humanity. I could understand if perhaps you just wanted to make it so people wouldn't get the benefits of entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid... etc... if they don't pay taxes.

Therefore, it assumes a property right *prior* to actually providing the service. Secondly, there must be limits to what your particular structure can entitle you. For example, if I build a road near my house in North Carolina, I could hardly claim that everyone living in California (or even most people in North Carolina) has ceded their property rights to me.

In that case, then yes I do believe the gang would own that land.\n\nDo they also live there, are building things there, or are using the land in some way? Or are they literally only merely keeping others out?\n\nAnyways, I don't think that would quite be an appropriate analogy, because governments aren't merely occupying unoccupied land (though they do that too); they are laying claims on occupied lands. It is not the case that there was government, and then there were people; rather, there were people, and then some of those people instituted schemes on the other people and themselves and called it a government.\n\n&gt; That depends on the specific government. It's going to depend on what the general public thought at the formation of the government, before there were any roads, public schools, etc. If the people agreed to be taxed, then the government would not have assumed anything prior to providing the service.\n\nNo government gets compliance from every member it taxes and enforces schemes on. It assumes a doctrine of political authority and it taxes regardless of consent.\n\n&gt; However, it could be the case that a specific government assumed a property right prior to providing services, but that would not invalidate the principle of government owning property; it would just show that some governments are unsubstantiated.\n\nI wasn't arguing against governments being able to own property *in principle*. Rather, I was arguing that they don't own all the property in the way you suggested *in practice.* The current government simply doesn't operate in the way which would be required to substantiate widespread ownership of land (even if such a notion is theoretically possible.) It certainly didn't get the compliance any non-governmental agent would be required to get for morally efficacious property acquisition. If a non-governmental agent performed the same actions as governments, and laid claim to the same lands for the same reasons, we'd call them thieves. Why the double standard?\n\n&gt; It's not just roads. It's roads, boosted economy due to public education, defense from foreign threats, etc. These things improve (either directly or indirectly) all of the land within the nation that the government protects.\n\nAgain, like I said, these things are dubious means of property acquisition. The providing of public education is *especially* weak. If I opened up a tutoring system and started educating children in my neighborhood (even threatening to lock their parents in my basement and steal their children away from then if they didn't send them to my tutoring sessions), and I did a good job at educating them, improving the local economy by increased education, then would I have a valid property rights claim on the area effected by my gift of education? Am I now justified in demanding others give me what is mine ($$) *or else*? Obviously something has gone very wrong in my actions in this scenario, and no valid property right is created from these actions. Likewise for the government. Do you *really* think the government owns all your stuff just because it forces some people to pay for the education of others?\n"}, {"id": "cn1lx21", "body": "Can I change your view that it is already the case that taxation is voluntary and can be opted out of?

I said they were analogous.\n\n&gt; An individual should be able to do with his private property as they please\n\nAnd the reason they are analogous is for this reason that you just said.  All property within the United States borders belongs to the government at the bottom-most level.  Yes, we say that you \"own\" it, but this is just for legal disputes involving other peers (those under the level of the government).  You can see this easily by observing what happens when you stop paying your property taxes:  exactly the same thing that happens if you stop paying your rent, i.e. you are evicted, and the actual owner takes back possession.  Your taxes are essentially rent that allow you to continue using the property, so the analogy is a very direct one.\n\nLet's pretend that isn't the case though.  Let's say that there was some other country where the government had no claim to the property you're using and it actually was yours.  Well then if you stopped paying taxes all you'd be able to do would be to continue to live in your house, but you would not be able to leave your property and enter into the foreign territory of the United States, i.e. anywhere around you period.  To set foot off your own property, you would need a passport, and you would need to go through border patrol to make sure you were not smuggling anything illegal into the United States.  If you ever wanted to work in the U.S, you would need to apply for a work visa.  That is the system you would want?\n\nThat's obviously all moot anyway since that's just some hypothetical country that doesn't exist where you truly own your own property, but it still makes the point about how unworkable it would be even in that place."}, {"id": "2q03zk", "body": "Let me preface this argument by saying that I don't particularly agree with the Tea Party.

They find recruits to get more recruits, and more and so forth, sending their money to the top by either purchasing \"training\" programs or \"products\". Most of their profits come from \"internal purchases\" of their product from these representatives and turn a huge profit for those on top. The [promotional videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHCMhmG6jLI) are not aimed for selling a product, but for recruitment efforts through showing flashy cars and young slick salespeople living the lifestyle that seems attainable.

Recruits purchase most of their products, not consumers. \n\n- \"All businesses operate in a pyramid form. CEO on top, Directors on the next level, Managers next, etc.\". This pisses me off the most. They manipulate organizational structures of legitimate businesses to establish their own scheme. MLMs organizational structures heavily rely on two or three types of positions and their \"recruits\" within their own structure directly provide the profits for the company's survival. Most business organizations do not include the consumer or customer as a position in their structure because profit is irrelevant this illustration. \n\n- \"You are just small minded. Go work at your 9-5 while I will make my millions in a month\". Disgusting how this justifies a scheme like theirs. \n\nThus, because MLMs and network market corps work in these ways, they should immediately be shut down and made illegal. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While I personally do not go anywhere near them, I have friends who have done so, which various degrees of success. \n\nFirst, I'd address their &gt; flashy cars and young slick salespeople living the lifestyle that seems attainable\nUnfortunately, with any direct sales job, you are going to see this. The qualities they need for a salesperson is greed and perseverance. It's a numbers game. No matter how crappy your product, maybe 0.1% of the people you talk to will buy it. The harder you work your salespeople, the more customers you'll get. How do they get you to work so hard? By showing you what you *could* achieve. They need people hungry, willing, and ruthless. Think used car salesmen, credit-card pushers, investment-linked life insurance agents, contracted donation collectors (basically a mercenary sales team). The work is shitty, tiring, thankless, and the attrition rate is incredibly high. You **need** people with that sort of 'hard work will give me success', 'I'm just a temporarily embarrassed millionaire' mentality. And the truth of the matter is that by the law of large numbers a small percentage DO actually make it. You can't fault MLMs for using a motivational strategy used by so many other industries.\n\nAs for the product vs recruitment aspect, there is definitely a tendency for the recruitment aspect to dominate the product. However, it is not always true that the product itself is completely useless. If the product is something that you use often, and you are able to purchase it at a discount through the company, it is possible for someone to be a member and not do recruitment. That is why bulk-buy MLMs are so popular here. Think of it as a members-only groupon. A Travel group MLM bulk buys plane tickets and accommodation and offers its own 'members' a booking service. They price beat at a 10% discount, and organize 'group getaways' for its members at quite steep discounts to clear inventory. Friends have successfully leveraged on this policy to get really good prices on their vacations. \n\nOn a personal level, I have seen MLMs empower and motivate friends. To see a friend go from hating his job, his opportunities in life, and just feeling victimized in general, to becoming someone who is actually taking steps to improve himself and his life is quite heartening. He may not earn much more than what he used to do, but the experience and self-worth he gets is something that he can use for his future career. And at the end of the day that is really what MLMs are useful for, a stepping stone for the future."}, {"id": "2q02l7", "body": "There was a recent [WTF post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2puqti/my_boss_insisted_this_team_national_he_wants_us/) that inspired me to dig a little deeper on what Multi-Level Marketing (or MLMs) and Network Marketing Corps are and I was disgusted at how these businesses operate.

We are still in business for over x amount of years.\n\n\"We haven't been arrested for it yet, so that magically makes it okay\" is an incredibly stupid argument\n\n&gt; All businesses operate in a pyramid form.\n\nTo call this \"bullshit\" would be an insult to the excrement of male bovines\n\n&gt; You are just small minded. Go work at your 9-5 while I will make my millions in a month\n\nThat's just nonsense, not even an attempt at justifying anything\n\nNow, while the excuses you've quoted are idiotic, and I agree that these businesses are generally crooked scams and most if not all could be justifiably shut down for fraud, I'd say that there **IS** a small but relevant difference between MLM and a classical Pyramid Scheme.  Selling a product *is* a relevant consideration, though not an absolute defense.  \n\nIn a classical pyramid scheme, **the ONLY way to get new money into the system is by fleecing new recruits**.  Eventually, the pyramid is guaranteed to collapse due to lack of recruits, at which point the lower levels are shit outta luck, while the higher-ups have already pocketed the cash.  \n\nIn contrast, MLM has *TWO* possible sources of revenue: recruiting **and** product sales.  Which one dominates depends on the specific MLM scam.  In an MLM scheme, it is theoretically possible, *however unlikely*, to make money purely through sales, without recruiting any new members.  If a particular MLM is set up to make this effectively impossible, then it reduces to a pyramid scheme.  \n\nMLM can be likened to a crossbreed between pyramid schemes and traditional sales.  The MLM variant is less fraudulent, parasitic and sleazy than its ancestor (which is not to say that it's **NOT** fraudulent, parasitic, or sleazy, only that it's *less so*), and has better long-term survival prospects.  This makes it different (and in every way that comes to mind at least somewhat better), but it doesn't come close to making MLM honest.\n\nOverall, I'd say that there is a relevant difference, which makes MLM better than a pyramid scheme (though not necessarily by much), but MLM is still built on exploitation and fraud, and most of them are crooked enough to deserve prosecution (some for the same reasons as pyramid schemes, and some for product-related fraud)."}, {"id": "2q02l7", "body": "There was a recent [WTF post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2puqti/my_boss_insisted_this_team_national_he_wants_us/) that inspired me to dig a little deeper on what Multi-Level Marketing (or MLMs) and Network Marketing Corps are and I was disgusted at how these businesses operate.

They find recruits to get more recruits, and more and so forth, sending their money to the top by either purchasing \"training\" programs or \"products\". Most of their profits come from \"internal purchases\" of their product from these representatives and turn a huge profit for those on top. The [promotional videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHCMhmG6jLI) are not aimed for selling a product, but for recruitment efforts through showing flashy cars and young slick salespeople living the lifestyle that seems attainable. But instead, people receive mountains of debt or little profit in return. \n\nTheir excuses are BS too:\n\n- \"Pyramid schemes are illegal. We are still in business for over x amount of years. Plus we sell a product. So we are not a pyramid scheme\". The corporate loophole they use is that they are a business that sells a product. But the concept of a pyramid scheme is still there. Recruits purchase most of their products, not consumers. \n\n- \"All businesses operate in a pyramid form. CEO on top, Directors on the next level, Managers next, etc.\". This pisses me off the most. They manipulate organizational structures of legitimate businesses to establish their own scheme. MLMs organizational structures heavily rely on two or three types of positions and their \"recruits\" within their own structure directly provide the profits for the company's survival. Most business organizations do not include the consumer or customer as a position in their structure because profit is irrelevant this illustration. \n\n- \"You are just small minded. Go work at your 9-5 while I will make my millions in a month\". Disgusting how this justifies a scheme like theirs. \n\nThus, because MLMs and network market corps work in these ways, they should immediately be shut down and made illegal. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I agree with you, but I'm going to do a bit of Devil's Advocate here and also musings about what I think is wrong.\n\nThe reason that they don't want the DRS implemented is for a separate purpose than the purpose you're talking about and **if** the DRS was perfect, which [it is^1](http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/57617/ecb-seeks-apology-over-drs-claims/) [absolutely^2](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-2523625/ASHES-2013-England-bitterly-disappointed-DRS-decision-saw-mystified-Joe-Root.html) [not^3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3o6mbV5EWs), I firmly disagree with some aspects of the current implementation of the DRS.\n\nOne of the main concerns from the BCCI is that it is[ being used to justify the decision of the umpire](http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/11/11/lbw-plus-drs-equals-wtf/), and not to get better decisions. There is a primacy on the decision given by the on-field umpire, and further deliberation must work to **overturn** that decision. That is to say in close calls we go with the human eye who experienced it from one point of view inside milliseconds over what the multicamera-angle, enhanced stump-mic, heat-snick detection, delivery-tracking technology.\n\nWhy is that the current implementation? Because the people behind the systems don't trust the technology. They say it can be out by a few centimeters, the sounds picked up on stump mic could be anything, there has been [controversy](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-2385882/Ashes-2013-Batsmen-using-tape-bats-confuse-HotSpot-DRS-referrals.html) about the heat detection software not working. This is why they go with the original decision by the on field umpire primarily. Now, this is strange. On the one hand we're saying we should use this technology, but on the other hand, the implementation of it trusts the human eye over it.

And what happens in DRS, even when the DRS is around, those decisions won't go in our favour.\n\n&gt;\"Because if the umpire has given out, you take DRS, it is still out, because DRS is often used to justify the decision given by the umpire. What is important is to use DRS to give the right decision irrespective of whether the umpire has given it out or not out. There are a lot of ways to use the DRS, but this is something that needs to be put in a specific way. That it doesn't really matter if the umpire has given out or not out, if the ball hits the stumps [in projection] it is out; if half the ball hits the stumps you are out.\"\n\nIt seems the BCCI are revisiting their stance, however I think we should all revisit how the current DRS is being used."}, {"id": "cn1mq04", "body": "Alright. I agree with you, but I'm going to do a bit of Devil's Advocate here and also musings about what I think is wrong.\n\nThe reason that they don't want the DRS implemented is for a separate purpose than the purpose you're talking about and **if** the DRS was perfect, which [it is^1](http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/57617/ecb-seeks-apology-over-drs-claims/) [absolutely^2](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-2523625/ASHES-2013-England-bitterly-disappointed-DRS-decision-saw-mystified-Joe-Root.html) [not^3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3o6mbV5EWs), I firmly disagree with some aspects of the current implementation of the DRS.\n\nOne of the main concerns from the BCCI is that it is[ being used to justify the decision of the umpire](http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/11/11/lbw-plus-drs-equals-wtf/), and not to get better decisions. There is a primacy on the decision given by the on-field umpire, and further deliberation must work to **overturn** that decision. That is to say in close calls we go with the human eye who experienced it from one point of view inside milliseconds over what the multicamera-angle, enhanced stump-mic, heat-snick detection, delivery-tracking technology.\n\nWhy is that the current implementation? Because the people behind the systems don't trust the technology. They say it can be out by a few centimeters, the sounds picked up on stump mic could be anything, there has been [controversy](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-2385882/Ashes-2013-Batsmen-using-tape-bats-confuse-HotSpot-DRS-referrals.html) about the heat detection software not working. This is why they go with the original decision by the on field umpire primarily. Now, this is strange. On the one hand we're saying we should use this technology, but on the other hand, the implementation of it trusts the human eye over it. Either the technology isn't good enough, or it is and we should change how it's implemented so that the umpire's decision is no longer Word Of God in close calls.\n\nThis implementation also goes against an age old rule of umpiring the game - the batsman should get the benefit of the doubt.

Aside from that, I think there should also be a number of measures to help citizens make an informed choice, such as information classes in high-school (where you would learn to inform yourself objectively on various issues by crossing sources) and strong measures to help the press stay pluralist and the most objective possible (it could be things like banning lucrative press groups, in general to separate money and press).

Then, Athens' system was radically different from Switzerland's or elective oligarchy (I prefer calling it that, more than \"representative democracy\"): there were no elections, every person was chosen randomly, and it was a different context than today's, so in that sense I doubt the pertinence of the parallel. Finally, I do prefer that people choose not to vote if they don't inform themselves, rather than having a herd of misinformed, FOXNEWS-fed sheep voting, but that's also where the information classes and the clean press measures come in.\n\n&gt; If we can't get over 50% of electorate to vote every four years in general elections, then how can we get them to vote every year or even more often?\n\nThere is about 50% turnout every elections precisely because people are tired of elective oligarchy. Just think about it: \"why would I vote if it's just going to be the same asshole with the same policies which fucks me up again?\". Instead of that, voting directly on very important matters is way more effective than electing a guy who promises he will do something, because you are sure that if a majority votes yes, the measure will undoubtedly pass. \n\n\nOn a side note, I'd just like to say that our actual system is not old at all (it's been invented about 250 years ago) and that it's been invented to be an alternative to democracy and monarchy, keeping only some aspects of both. This is not the most perfect system, and mankind will only advance if new ideas emerge, while of course keeping an essential and constant debate.

It's no coincidence that Swiss people are so responsible in their political choices, it's precisely because they're been given responsibilities and not been treated like an electing herd of voting animals. \n\n&gt; Besides, there's still an institution of citizen initiative (it's for European Parliament, but many local parliaments have them as well), where you have to get, say 100 thousand signatures and your bill is discussed in the Parliament.\n\nIf you're talking about ICE, it's basically to the discretion of the EU Commission if they're allowing it or not. There was recently a demand for an ICE concerning TTIP and CETA, and it was refused (it still took place independently though, and collected over 1,200,000 signatures in the EU, but was not recognized). \n\n&gt; Where I live it was used either to stop primary school expansion to six-year-olds and banning abortion.\n\nWell it's regrettable, but the majority isn't always going to have the objectively \"good\" point of view, and it's at every person's discretion what is \"good\" or \"bad\" at the present moment. It's like with the first amendment in America: if you want freedom of speech, you will have to bear the extremists and all that stuff.\n\n&gt; Well, Switzerland is an unique example for direct democracy\n\nIt is an unique example precisely because it has almost never been tried anywhere else in the world. \n\n&gt; But as it is a small and rich country, in other places things that work there might not work elsewhere.\n\nI hear you on this, but I still maintain that size and wealth are probably less relevant than education and political responsibility. \n\n&gt; The same way democracy in Athens became an autocracy after failure of direct decision-making that was susceptible to corruption, I think direct democracy can fail due to corruption, or disinformation, or simply exhaustion, as it is itself costly and many people won't vote on issues they don't care about.\n\nThere is a couple of points I'd like to address in this statement: first, Athens stayed a real democracy for over 200 years, which is (for most modern countries at least) more than this representative regime has survived thus far. Then, Athens' system was radically different from Switzerland's or elective oligarchy (I prefer calling it that, more than \"representative democracy\"): there were no elections, every person was chosen randomly, and it was a different context than today's, so in that sense I doubt the pertinence of the parallel. Finally, I do prefer that people choose not to vote if they don't inform themselves, rather than having a herd of misinformed, FOXNEWS-fed sheep voting, but that's also where the information classes and the clean press measures come in.\n\n&gt; If we can't get over 50% of electorate to vote every four years in general elections, then how can we get them to vote every year or even more often?\n\nThere is about 50% turnout every elections precisely because people are tired of elective oligarchy. Just think about it: \"why would I vote if it's just going to be the same asshole with the same policies which fucks me up again?\". Instead of that, voting directly on very important matters is way more effective than electing a guy who promises he will do something, because you are sure that if a majority votes yes, the measure will undoubtedly pass. \n\n\nOn a side note, I'd just like to say that our actual system is not old at all (it's been invented about 250 years ago) and that it's been invented to be an alternative to democracy and monarchy, keeping only some aspects of both. This is not the most perfect system, and mankind will only advance if new ideas emerge, while of course keeping an essential and constant debate.

First of all, a representative is supposed to represent the people's interests. How can an assembly represent a people well while having very different, often incompatible interests (these Congressmen aren't voting tax cuts for the people who elected them). I think you're idealizing the system too much: in theory it works, alright, but what about the 200 years of history which proves that it's flawed? I think we have enough evidence today to point at its flaws and discuss to try and fix them.\n\n&gt; decision on electing upper-class lawyers is a decision of electorate, which brings the question: if they decide to elect lawyers, what is a chance they will vote otherwise in case of referendum?\n\nThere are regular polls for controversial decisions made in Parliament, and for example for the EU Constitution in France, 80% of the Parliament was in favor, while 55% of the people voted against (also in a magnificently obvious parliamentary coup d'Etat, they simply changed the name of the treaty and passed it anyways, against the will of the people). There is a big problem having representatives which don't resemble you, and this is allowed mostly by the economic relations and the situation in general.\n\nHere I really like Spinoza's motto, which is \"take Man as he is, not as you'd like him to be\". \n\n&gt; if they decide to elect lawyers, what is a chance they will vote otherwise in case of referendum?\n\nI said it before, they have no strong incentive to inform themselves about the candidate's program because he'll just do his thing for 5 years.

Aside from that, I think there should also be a number of measures to help citizens make an informed choice, such as information classes in high-school (where you would learn to inform yourself objectively on various issues by crossing sources) and strong measures to help the press stay pluralist and the most objective possible (it could be things like banning lucrative press groups, in general to separate money and press).

decision about from a commerical. A car or a paper towel has attributes than can be discussed in a commerical in a way that the consumer can understand. They use commericals to inform consumers as to why the product is a better choice than the competition by discussing what is done differently. \n\nMedicine is not marketed by talking about what chemicals are in it relative to the competition, rather they show clips of patients enjoying life while listing a crapload of deadly side effects. Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product, but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine. Yes it is also true that doctors get the final say it is only with there perscription that a purchase of medication can be authorized, so then I ask why do we need the commercial in the first place? Why not just send doctors a brochure of the latest in medication? \n\nThere is also an arguement to be had for the \"vote with your dollar\" concept of capitalism, but in my view medicine is exempt from this because no one wants to have to buy medicine and no one who is not a doctor is qualified to say which medication is \"better\", as well as the fact that most consumers are not going to try a variety and medicines and keep buying that which they like the best as is the case with shampoo or food. To me, commercials for medicines are a shameless way for pharma companies to plug something and make money. Pharma should not be about profit, but results. The fact that the commercials are legal seem indicative of a dangerous trend of \"profit before well being\" that is present the industry. CMV!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
