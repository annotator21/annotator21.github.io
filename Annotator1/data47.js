When you process information, your brain instinctively pattern-matches with previous data. This is not a bad thing in and of itself; it's how we survived and became the dominant species. The problem is that it can match completely coincidental data points into a non-existent/coincidental pattern that doesn't have any hidden meaning behind it.

I don't know where to start...\n\nI'm a 25 year old white guy and straight, I've been single for about 2 years now and before that I was in a relationship for 4 and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don't know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had \"other girls on the go the whole time\". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. \"Aw don't worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)\" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.\n\nBut it isn't just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was 8 and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasn't until about 2004/5 that he met Helen. She was a early 40 something year old nurse that lived about 50 miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldn't put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in, of course we didn't object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldn't see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around, who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than 6 months before she \"wanted to get a house that belongs to them\" and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was 19 and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us, never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didn't want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She (it seemed) just wanted to go to work, come home, relax and go shopping (and housework on the weekends only). I don't think that *Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and won't take responsibility!* because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals, clean her clothes and didn't take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about 6 years, she cheats on my father and moves back into her mum's house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left, he looked like a skeleton and he didn't even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth, about \u00a370,000 I think, even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.\n\nThen there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend (who also cheated and left him in dept, funnily enough) and I have to say that he is the most incredible father you've ever met in your life. His son (5) loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him, nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him 3 times a week and has him every other weekend, he sees his family, goes to parks and zoos and whatnot, he gets along with everyone, he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand, while providing him with everything he needs and I'm sure she is a brilliant mother to him, has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about 70 miles away, and there isn't anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesn't seem to care too much, \"He'll make new friends, you can see him through Skype, newboyfriend will be a father figure for him\" and yes, she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this, he loves his son more than anything in the world, and to be told by the mother that you can't see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasn't told her son and won't let my friend do it either, or \"I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didn't tell him\". I'm on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can, but believe it or not, he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.\n\nNow, she is only 19 and she probably doesn't know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I don't know how either but I'm trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him \"constantly going on about it\" and \"not even trying to cheer up\". She is the same as Helen is some respects, lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills, always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the *What's mine is mines and whats is yours is mine* attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt, selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly \"Why are you looking at that girls arse?\" comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it, *her* night had been ruined because he saw him \"staring\" at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldn't do anything about it. He wasn't willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever, leading him into trouble (as Reddit keeps reminding me, happens *all the time*).\n\nWow, this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. [Its like a quote from Louis C.K](http://i.imgur.com/PVZ9t.jpg) Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have. \n\n**TL;DR. I've had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I can't trust one and find it difficult to respect them.**\n\nFor the love of God I'm begging you, please help me change my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Your choices are basically a life in a perpetually zonked out state, or a life of crippling pain and misery. \n\n\nIn my opinion, it'd be perfectly  reasonable for this person to consider his options, take an objective look at them, and conclude that the best course of action is suicide. It'd be perfectly valid and rational to decide that ceasing to live is superior to a lifetime of chronic mental illness, and all the costs (financial, social, familial/interpersonal, etc) associated with managing it and living with it. \n\n\nI specifically use depression/mental illness as an example because people often argue that depressed, or mentally ill people shouldn't have the option of euthanasia because their illness clouds their ability to realistically assess their situation. In my example, the depressed person's reasoning appears perfectly sound so I don't see why he shouldn't commit suicide. \n\n\nCan you CMV? \n\n\n**EDIT:** a lot of people have made the point that a depressed or otherwise mentally ill person is irrational by nature and unable to make rational decisions about something as serious as suicide. Ok, that's a fair point. So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option? \n\n\nAnother common argument is that chronic mental illness is often (mostly?) manageable, sometimes very effectively with relative ease. Fair point. How about cases where the illness is not easily manageable? Where it requires a cocktail of drugs, constant therapy and relapses are common and can occur at any time?\n\n\nOr, say the person suffers from schizophrenia, which is incurable and requires lifetime treatment. The medication often comes with many unpleasant side effects, and sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state. Think the protagonist in *A Beautiful Mind*. \nOther than a severely diminished quality of life, the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc. Couldn't he/she rationally decide such a life is simply not worth living? \n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You'll have to be on medication and in and out of therapy for the rest of your life just to be able to function. Your choices are basically a life in a perpetually zonked out state, or a life of crippling pain and misery. \n\n\nIn my opinion, it'd be perfectly  reasonable for this person to consider his options, take an objective look at them, and conclude that the best course of action is suicide. It'd be perfectly valid and rational to decide that ceasing to live is superior to a lifetime of chronic mental illness, and all the costs (financial, social, familial/interpersonal, etc) associated with managing it and living with it. \n\n\nI specifically use depression/mental illness as an example because people often argue that depressed, or mentally ill people shouldn't have the option of euthanasia because their illness clouds their ability to realistically assess their situation. In my example, the depressed person's reasoning appears perfectly sound so I don't see why he shouldn't commit suicide. \n\n\nCan you CMV? \n\n\n**EDIT:** a lot of people have made the point that a depressed or otherwise mentally ill person is irrational by nature and unable to make rational decisions about something as serious as suicide. Ok, that's a fair point. So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option? \n\n\nAnother common argument is that chronic mental illness is often (mostly?) manageable, sometimes very effectively with relative ease. Fair point. How about cases where the illness is not easily manageable? Where it requires a cocktail of drugs, constant therapy and relapses are common and can occur at any time?\n\n\nOr, say the person suffers from schizophrenia, which is incurable and requires lifetime treatment. The medication often comes with many unpleasant side effects, and sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state.

You'll have to be on medication and in and out of therapy for the rest of your life just to be able to function. Your choices are basically a life in a perpetually zonked out state, or a life of crippling pain and misery. \n\n\nIn my opinion, it'd be perfectly  reasonable for this person to consider his options, take an objective look at them, and conclude that the best course of action is suicide. It'd be perfectly valid and rational to decide that ceasing to live is superior to a lifetime of chronic mental illness, and all the costs (financial, social, familial/interpersonal, etc) associated with managing it and living with it. \n\n\nI specifically use depression/mental illness as an example because people often argue that depressed, or mentally ill people shouldn't have the option of euthanasia because their illness clouds their ability to realistically assess their situation. In my example, the depressed person's reasoning appears perfectly sound so I don't see why he shouldn't commit suicide. \n\n\nCan you CMV? \n\n\n**EDIT:** a lot of people have made the point that a depressed or otherwise mentally ill person is irrational by nature and unable to make rational decisions about something as serious as suicide. Ok, that's a fair point. So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option? \n\n\nAnother common argument is that chronic mental illness is often (mostly?) manageable, sometimes very effectively with relative ease. Fair point. How about cases where the illness is not easily manageable? Where it requires a cocktail of drugs, constant therapy and relapses are common and can occur at any time?\n\n\nOr, say the person suffers from schizophrenia, which is incurable and requires lifetime treatment. The medication often comes with many unpleasant side effects, and sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state.

So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option? \n\n\nAnother common argument is that chronic mental illness is often (mostly?) manageable, sometimes very effectively with relative ease. Fair point. How about cases where the illness is not easily manageable? Where it requires a cocktail of drugs, constant therapy and relapses are common and can occur at any time?\n\n\nOr, say the person suffers from schizophrenia, which is incurable and requires lifetime treatment. The medication often comes with many unpleasant side effects, and sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state. Think the protagonist in *A Beautiful Mind*. \nOther than a severely diminished quality of life, the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc. Couldn't he/she rationally decide such a life is simply not worth living? \n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Why would they answer that any other way? If they are no longer depressed, they've already endured the worst, it's already over, there's no reason for them to say \"No I wish I had killed myself\" because now that they no longer struggle with depression their life has improved and there would be no reason to wish they were dead anymore. It's like asking someone who was super poor and only struggle in life was money but just won the power ball if he's glad he's still alive. Of course he is now that he is a millionaire.\n\nAs the other person said, that is also a selection bias. The very people who would answer that question any other way would not fall under the selection because if they still regret having lived through those periods, they likely aren't out of depression.\n\nIn a different thought, I'd be more interested to think about what it would mean if you asked people if they would want to continue living if you could guarantee that they would live in the same deplorable conditions for the next 10 years, but that does not mean after 10 years they would be better, it would just merely open up similar chances that exist now.

You'll have to be on medication and in and out of therapy for the rest of your life just to be able to function. Your choices are basically a life in a perpetually zonked out state, or a life of crippling pain and misery. \n\n\nIn my opinion, it'd be perfectly  reasonable for this person to consider his options, take an objective look at them, and conclude that the best course of action is suicide. It'd be perfectly valid and rational to decide that ceasing to live is superior to a lifetime of chronic mental illness, and all the costs (financial, social, familial/interpersonal, etc) associated with managing it and living with it. \n\n\nI specifically use depression/mental illness as an example because people often argue that depressed, or mentally ill people shouldn't have the option of euthanasia because their illness clouds their ability to realistically assess their situation. In my example, the depressed person's reasoning appears perfectly sound so I don't see why he shouldn't commit suicide. \n\n\nCan you CMV? \n\n\n**EDIT:** a lot of people have made the point that a depressed or otherwise mentally ill person is irrational by nature and unable to make rational decisions about something as serious as suicide. Ok, that's a fair point. So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option? \n\n\nAnother common argument is that chronic mental illness is often (mostly?) manageable, sometimes very effectively with relative ease. Fair point. How about cases where the illness is not easily manageable? Where it requires a cocktail of drugs, constant therapy and relapses are common and can occur at any time?\n\n\nOr, say the person suffers from schizophrenia, which is incurable and requires lifetime treatment. The medication often comes with many unpleasant side effects, and sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state. Think the protagonist in *A Beautiful Mind*. \nOther than a severely diminished quality of life, the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc. Couldn't he/she rationally decide such a life is simply not worth living? \n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

No, he just doesn't want to go to school tomorrow and face the taunting again.\n\nI am not talking about that, and you should have know that.\n\nI am talking about the 35 year old who has been depressed and under medical care for depression since his 20s. He has tried many medications, and the only ones that prevent him from feeling sad make him feel like an emotionless zombie (and every couple years he needs a larger dose), and his doctors don't know what else to try...  He starts talking to his therapist about what is in store for him for the rest of his life.  His therapist gives him the prognosis that it's possible he will get better, but honestly, the therapist has no reason to think this is likely and shares this fact...  This is the 3rd therapist who has told him this in the last 8 years...\n\nThis is the person who can rationally commit suicide.\n\nWe are not talking about most depressed people, and certainly not about children.\n\nDo you understand that this is not a conversation about most depressed people?  Do you understand that we are talking about special cases?  Ones of chronic depression, and even then only certain cases of chronic depression?"}, {"id": "cn3c42b", "body": "You're assuming all people make long-term decisions.

I'm 50, and was first diagnosed with chronic, cyclical depression when I was 12, the first time I tried to kill myself.   I've spent a few times in hospital, and more time finding meds that worked.  Sometimes it took trying 5 or 6 different meds, over the course of years, to find something that helped me get on top; of the depression.  I still get mind-numbingly, soul-destroyingly depressed every 5 or 6 years, but because I've been through it so many times, I power through it, and I know that I can get through it to the other side.\n\nI do think that people should be 'allowed' to kill themselves, without societal condemnation.

Depression (real depression, not just having a sad) affects you to the point where it rules you- when you can't get out of bed, when you don't care about anything around you, when you think that death is the only way out.  \n\nI've done mental health support work for a long time, and while I am pro a person's right to die at a time of their choosing, I still struggle with where mental health issues tie into that.  For a lot of people, chronic depression can be very livable, and doesn't really interfere with having a 'good' life.  But that's often dependent on their access to mental health care, finding a healthy regime (which may or may not involve meds, or other interventions), and sometimes treating depression as a chronic medical issue, rather than something that controls you.

There is something comforting in knowing you can choose to end your pain and struggle. At the same time you can sort of appreciate your sadness, anger, numbness, whatever it may be and maybe even find some beauty in it. There are moments of feeling okay that make it all worth it, whether it be minutes or days. Your life is your own unique perspective that no one else will ever experience in the exact same way.\n   \n   \nThat being said, in my opinion suicide is an existential freedom that every person has a right to, there's something beautiful about knowing you have the option. It can be extremely rational given the circumstance but it can also be very irrational given the mental state.    \n    \nSuicide is the last bit of freedom and it will ALWAYS be available to you, no need to make a hasty decision on it.

Ok, that's a fair point. So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option?\n\nI wouldn't say that people with mental illnesses are irrational by nature. I would say that their mental illnesses cause them have irrational thoughts or behave irrationally. Also, just because they may be medicated and stable does not mean that they're illness is just gone. It takes *way* more effort than just taking some pills and seeing a therapist every now and then. \n\nAlso, just because they may be medicated and stable does not mean that they're illness is just gone. Someone with depression not only has to find the right cocktail to be \"stable\" but has to work through therapy as well. For example, someone with Diabetes can never be cured, but it is treatable, and they can learn to make changes in their life so that they can be healthy, productive, and happy. CBT and medication work together in the same way. \n\nAdditionally, what I'd consider \"stable\" in the first place is someone who can manage and be a \"normal and happy\" member of society. I'd say that if someone *wants* to die, they aren't stable, but psychology and medicine evolve everyday and we are really beginning to develop the resources to help people who feel that their life is no longer worth living, because as cheesy as it is, people matter, and these people deserve help and treatment so that they can experience life and contribute to the world.\n\n&gt;Another common argument is that chronic mental illness is often (mostly?) manageable, sometimes very effectively with relative ease. Fair point. How about cases where the illness is not easily manageable? Where it requires a cocktail of drugs, constant therapy and relapses are common and can occur at any time?\n\nWell, if the individual is dealing with a mental illness that is difficult to manage - especially the kind you're describing, where they're trying to find the right cocktail, doctors, kind of therapy, or may relapse at any time, how are they to make the rational decision to commit suicide? \n\nIt sounds like when you pointed this out, you forgot that the CMV is about *suicide being a rational decision.* Most decisions made in these states are not rational. There are multiple things going on in this example, too - chemicals in the brain changing rapidly, different kinds of therapy being tried, not to mention all of the *side effects* that can affect the individual. There is a reason we do all of this though. We do it so that the person **can** be stable eventually and live a comfortable life. I firmly believe that someone who is complying willingly with therapists and psychiatrists and open to getting better *can* get better.\n\n&gt;Or, say the person suffers from schizophrenia, which is incurable and requires lifetime treatment. The medication often comes with many unpleasant side effects, and sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state. Think the protagonist in A Beautiful Mind. Other than a severely diminished quality of life, the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc. Couldn't he/she rationally decide such a life is simply not worth living?\n\nI'd like to point out that *A Beautiful Mind*, though a good movie, *is* a dramatization. Again, an individual who is suffering from severe Schizophrenia (which, by the way, is extremely rare) to the point where they can't function is also not really in the mindset to make a rational decision, especially about suicide. Also again, there are many, many things you can do to help someone who will willingly comply with their doctors (which is where it becomes sticky, especially with those suffering from illnesses like Schizophrenia) like change the way thought processes work, behavior, outlook, all while searching for the right medicine. And I'd say at this point in the situation being described, if someone is personally willing to get the treatment they deserve, they may feel like giving up sometimes, but there is something in them that is pushing them to stay alive."}, {"id": "2q6d06", "body": "\nLet's say you're 18, and diagnosed with chronic depression.

If the person is medicated and functioning well but is a diagnosed depressive and has depressive episodes, couldn't they decide -- during one of their good and healthy periods -- that a lifetime of depressive episodes, therapy, pills and the associated burden to their loved ones and social/professional life is not worth it? \n\n&gt;Here's the sad thing about suicide: If someone wants to really, really do it, they will. The second they find the method to end it and decide it's what they REALLY want to do, they're going to end their lives. If we step back and let people kill themselves without trying to reach out to them, there are going to be a lot of lives lost that could have potentially turned out much better.\n\nThis is a very good point."}, {"id": "cn48s44", "body": "&gt;If the person is medicated and functioning well but is a diagnosed depressive and has depressive episodes, couldn't they decide -- **during one of their good and healthy periods** -- that a lifetime of depressive episodes, therapy, pills and the associated burden to their loved ones and social/professional life is not worth it?\n\nDo you mean during one of their depressive episodes?

If you had a rational reason for believing certain religions, then I think suicide becomes the clear winner. (Example: Christianity, at least many interpretations. Stab yourself, repent sincerely before you bleed out, bam, straight to heaven.) On the other hand, other religions (or interpretations) could outlaw suicide altogether. (Example: If you don't allow the above loophole, then many versions of Christianity say suicide sends you straight to Hell, which *must* be worse than what you're going through right now.)\n\nIn short, any sort of afterlife could basically dominate this entire conversation. If we can actually know what's after death, and if there *is* anything after death, then this entire conversation becomes much less important than the question of whether suicide will send you to Heaven or to Hell.\n\nBut, if we go with my assumption that any afterlife is unknowable, but there's probably nothing at all, then:\n\n&gt; So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option?\n\nHow can they be sure? While we might agree that it's *possible* a person could want suicide even when currently of sound mind, wanting suicide is so often a symptom of mental illness that, if I were in that situation, especially in a situation where I knew I'd had to deal with some serious mental illness up to this point, I'd immediately doubt the \"of sound mind\" part.\n\nAn interesting feature of depression is that it's treatable, and many sufferers *can* get past it, but there's also evidence to suggest that depressed people see the world *more* clearly than people who aren't depressed -- most people will be optimistic where a depressed person will be realistic. Yet depression often causes suicidal thoughts in people who *don't* have a good reason to want to end their life.\n\nIf we agree that it's not rational to commit suicide merely because you're currently suffering from depression (since plenty of people can and do make it through that, and there's plenty of medication to help), then it seems rational to me to wait around just in case this turns out to be a symptom of your illness. And the unfortunate bit is that, the worse your situation, the harder it is to tell if it's just the illness talking or if you really do want to end it all.\n\nI'd place far more credibility on a person's express wishes while healthy and sane. \"If I ever get *that* senile, just kill me.\" That kind of thing. But suppose I wrote a note to myself that said this, and gave me specific criteria for how to tell I was senile/schizophrenic/whatever enough that I'd want to end it all -- the worse my symptoms, the more likely it is that my note-to-self is an hallucination!\n\n&gt; Think the protagonist in A Beautiful Mind. Other than a severely diminished quality of life, the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc.\n\nAnd yet, especially if we follow the movie's premise directly, he eventually ended up in a good place. He was less of a burden. Especially when he was lucid, once he finally learned that he had lifelong \"friends\" who were hallucinations, he became relatively high-functioning -- the most burdensome thing he's shown doing at that point is having to double-check, when he meets a new person, that they're not an hallucination.\n\nI think this also illustrates just how hard it is to know. I remember about the last third (or less) of that movie, right up until he finally realized who his \"friends\" were, he was spiraling more and more out of control. If it was hard for *you* to imagine how he might manage his illness, how much harder must it have been for him, in any moments of clarity he might've had?\n\nAll that said, I can think of a scenario where a mentally ill person might, in a moment of clarity, rationally decide to end their life: Suppose you *know* that you are capable of hurting people, and you know that, left unchecked, you'll do exactly that. But, for some reason, you can't get anyone to take you seriously. You try to turn yourself in, but the police laugh at you; you try to commit yourself, but the hospital won't accept you. (This strains plausibility, but it seems possible that if the police and medical facilities were especially bad, especially if they thought you were just a bum trying to get free housing and meals by pretending to be crazy...) In that case, if you know you have to be stopped or you'll (say) rape and murder a bunch of toddlers, then suicide absolutely might be the best option.\n\nI think the main difference is that battling a mental illness is a perpetual state that you might one day be cured of, so it makes sense to wait and see and gamble on it not being as bad as you think. But you can't bring those victims back to life, so it's probably not worth the risk of going on living just in case you're not as bad as you think."}, {"id": "2q6d06", "body": "\nLet's say you're 18, and diagnosed with chronic depression.

We, on the other hand, are rational beings who attempt to come to terms with this world. He calls this absurdity: our rationally trying to explain an irrational world.\n\nOnce we realize this, as with anything else, we can't really unrealize or unbelieve it without admitting tremendous denial. One friend admitting feelings for another comes to mind where once it's out in the open, it can't be undone, though people try to deny it. Or once you know left/right, you can't really unknow that, but I suppose you could deny it. On an existential level, though, suicide is the ultimate form of this denial.

Still, I disagree with you.\n\n&gt;Let's say you're 18\n\nMany antidepressants, including several SSRIs (the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants), carry a \"black box\" warning label because they increase suicidal thoughts and attempts in children and young adults up to age 24.^[2](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/antidepressant-medications-for-children-and-adolescents-information-for-parents-and-caregivers.shtml)  Since the FDA implemented the warning ten years ago, fewer young people are prescribed antidepressants than would have been expected.^[3](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1408480) Only four SSRIs are approved for use in children in the United States^[4](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/ucm096321.htm). Only one of those is approved for Major Depressive Disorder. The other three are for OCD, which carries less risk of suicide^[5](http://ocd.about.com/od/livingwithoc1/a/Ocd-And-Suicide.htm) (not to dismiss it, though; it's still much higher than the general population, and people with depression *and* OCD have a particularly high rate of suicide.) Of course, SSRIs don't work for everyone, much less Prozac alone out of the entire class. In your edit, you refocus on treatment-resistant cases, so these are the people you're talking about. The point being that it is unlikely that someone with a mental illness will be prescribed a useful medication by 18, even though the onset of mental illness will have occurred in at least half of the people who will eventually be diagnosed.^[6](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2005/mental-illness-exacts-heavy-toll-beginning-in-youth.shtml) It's not just medication either: almost half of \"youth ages 8 to 15 with a mental illness received no mental health services\" in 2012.^[7](http://www.nami.org/factsheets/mentalillness_factsheet.pdf)\n\nI\u2019ll return to the black box warning again. I started taking Efexxor at the age of 24.  Like others in this thread have discussed, most of my suicidal thoughts had been about the *obstacles* to committing suicide and how to get around them--mostly trying to find a way not to traumatize someone else. When I started Efexxor, those obstacles stopped mattering. I used to just think about leaping into to traffic; now I'd find myself drifting off the sidewalk as soon as the thought crossed my mind. The only thing that prevented me from doing any serious, irreversible harm to myself in that time was that I had been suicidal for so long. I had done my research, and I didn't want to die in a horrifically painful way. The inhibition was all but gone. At one point, I found myself opening a bottle of drain cleaner to drink, and that's when I freaked out. I finally told a GP what was going on, and he instructed me to stop taking it until I could see a psychiatrist in a month (I'm poor and rely on community health programs). *I kept taking it* just because it was so novel to have emotions again. I felt great during the times I wasn't about to commit suicide. Now, if I had proper oversight, I would have been forced to stop taking the only antidepressant that's helped me. SSRIs didn't work for me (and actually exacerbated my PTSD), I can't take Welbutrin because of the eating disorder, and I probably should not have been prescribed TCAs, TeCAs, or MAOIs because the lower threshold of overdose. That would have meant it'd be *even longer* before I got effective treatment. If I had known at 14 that it would take a decade before anything helped, four of those years spent actively trying to get well (because lots of people don't get help immediately), I believe I could have found the willpower to kill myself--and yet, here I am, not suicidal anymore. So what's the minimum for how long someone has to try? Would you say ten years, knowing that if you didn't someone like me would be dead, knowing that if you did many people wouldn't be able to wait that long?\n\n&gt;You'll have to be on medication and in and out of therapy for the rest of your life just to be able to function.\n\nThere are plenty of medical conditions that require constant, lifelong treatment and monitoring. A regimen that manages symptoms is not a failure just because it isn't a cure. Would it be justifiable in your mind for someone with diabetes to commit suicide because they will always need insulin? Long-term use of psychiatric medication poses greater risk for health issues, but so do other medications. Aging itself comes with more health issues too. I think the risk is worthwhile.\n\nI have cerebral palsy, fairly mild. Nevertheless it has caused me chronic pain for my entire life, sometimes excruciating. Obviously, it restricts my activities to an extent. I am likely to develop osteoarthritis in my thirties because of the strain it places on my joints. There have been plenty of reasons why I wanted to die; cerebral palsy isn't one of them.  So chronic pain and permanent impairment don't necessarily prompt suicidal thinking. Suicidality is a more a symptom of mental illness than a response.\n\n&gt;perpetually zonked out state\n&gt;sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state. Think the protagonist in *A Beautiful Mind.*\n\nMental illness leads to a \"zombie-like state.\" A symptom of depression is psychomotor retardation, i.e., your movements slow down. Severe episodes of various mental illnesses provoke catatonia.

Like other side effects, though, that problem can be resolved by changing the dose or medication or by polypharmacy. Therapy could also help, and in some people this side effect vanishes as their body becomes accustomed to the medication.^[8](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/195/3/211.full) I can't speak as directly to mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. It's true that those medications often produce lethargy and sedation, but as with antidepressants, side effects can be mitigated.\n\nTo paint all psychiatric medication as numbing is to promote a dangerous myth, one that Hollywood loves to recycle (as recently as 2012's *Silver Linings Playbook*). This was a big reason that I refused treatment for so long. This is the reason that my family didn't acknowledge that I should be on antidepressants (and *de facto* prevented me from taking them). I'm not the only one, either.\n\n&gt;crippling pain and misery\n\nIn a comment, you compare mental suffering to physical pain and your CMV to euthanasia for someone with permanent, dire health problems. The phrase I quoted strikes me as a misunderstanding of what mental illness is like and renders a fundamental premise of your argument flawed. The severity of a mental illness isn't determined solely by how much suffering it causes, but also by the degree to which it impairs a person; in the same way that a person with a broken leg feels more pain than does someone with a spinal injury that removes sensation from their legs.  Treatment-resistant cases are, by definition, long-term. It is simply impossible to sustain a state of anguish indefinitely.  The pain and impairment are separate entities. I'll provide examples from my life.:\n\n* At my most depressed, I don't feel anything. I'm not sad. I'm not in pain. I'm numb and can't muster the energy to care. I'll sleep for twenty hours at a time. I can't move when I'm awake.\n\n* When I'm having a flashback or nightmare, I feel fear, not pain. \n\n* OCD is a mixed bag. It is upsetting at times, particularly when it prevents me from, say, going to work on time. However, when I'm at liberty to complete my rituals, it's very satisfying.\n\n* An eating disorder makes you too exhausted to be in pain. If you go long enough without eating, even the physical pain goes away.\n\nIt's not until after the worst has passed that I can feel distressed.\n\nIt's well-documented that people are at greater risk of attempting suicide when their symptoms begin to go into remission. Thus, it's not that their pain has reached an unbearable level. It's that they suddenly have the energy and focus, the ability. Most suicide attempts are impulse decisions, not the result of a premeditated cost-benefit analysis. Suicide rates are lower in states with fewer guns.^[9](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/) When Britain switched from coal gas to natural gas in the late '50s, suicides dropped by a third; and when a barrier was erected at the Ellington Bridge in Washington, the suicide rate fell by 50%, that is, the number of people who would normally jump there.^[10](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/struck-living/201012/can-obstacle-prevent-suicide) None of this proves that a person *can't* rationally, consciously choose to commit suicide, but it merits recognition that the majority of people who attempt or succeed *don't* first stoically weigh the options. I did and chose less lethal methods that could parade as an accident because I didn't want to be blamed. \n\n&gt;medicated and in a sound state of mind \n\nThis hypothetical scenario may not be as feasible as you imagine. Foremost, someone has to be diagnosed *correctly.* Notably, bipolar disorder is frequently mistaken for depression or even schizophrenia.^[11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945875/) Other medical conditions may pass for mental illness.^[12](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201212/mislabeling-medical-illness-mental-disorder)\n\nI already described a few of the difficulties minors have in getting treatment. About 60% of adults with mental illness received no mental health services in 2012 too.  The infrastructure for mental health services can't keep up with the need.^[13](http://www.msnbc.com/all/no-beds-the-mentally-ill). Until the Affordable Care Act, there was essentially no insurance options for mental health.^[14](http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/mental-illness-an-essential-benefit-sidebar/) Medicare restricts mental healthcare in ways that it does not curtail other services.^[15](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/25/stigma-of-mental-illness/9875351/) Large numbers of the homeless and imprisoned have mental disorders,^[7](http://www.nami.org/factsheets/mentalillness_factsheet.pdf) so they plainly aren't being treated. How many of them might be in better circumstances if they were? How many would never have ended up in jail or on the street in the first place?\n\nMental illnesses show a high comorbidity.^[16](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=208671&amp;gt) I am not unique by having more than diagnosis. I have already mentioned how comorbidity can complicate treatment, and it also prolongs the duration of treatment. But let's pretend I've entirely eliminated the depression and eating disorder. Well, there's no \"cure\" for OCD or PTSD. How do you determine if I or someone like me is in a sufficiently sound state of mind to commit suicide? You brought up relapses--How long does it take to decide whether I am indeed sane or instead starting to relapse?\n\n&gt;the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc.\n\nNow these aren't strictly consequences of mental illness. These are functions of the way society *behaves* towards people with mental illness.^[17](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/25/stigma-of-mental-illness/9875351/) After all, the mentally ill in America were subjected to compulsory sterilization into the mid-'70s.^[18](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html) If we are burdens to our families, it's because the health system we have currently is underfunded and ill-equipped to address mental illness. If we are isolated, it is largely because we're rejected based on misconceptions. If we have a hard time keeping a job, it's because we aren't offered adequate treatment, accommodation, or both. \n\nYour CMV is compassionate at heart, and that is a new and wonderful phenomenon. It also reflects a badly misguided approach to mental illness and suicide. \n\nI've survived so much that I've got to make it mean something, rational or not.\n\n**(TL;DR: I should be a goddamn meme.

The [top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/2p56dv/why_continue_living/cmtiz9u) by /u/TychoCelchuuu is the best reasoning I've seen why suicide is *never* a rational decision.\n\nIn short:\n&gt; \"Why continue living\" is one of these [a \"practical reason\" question] - the answer is \"because you want to\" or \"because dying would be worse than living,\" and these answers work in almost every case. Almost everyone wants to live and, given that you've already been born, especially for people who live in prosperous Western countries, dying is almost always worse than living. We can see evidence for this in the extreme actions people typically take to keep from dying."}, {"id": "cn3wyin", "body": "how can you say that living is *always* objectively better than dying?

Along these lines, one would have to address the question of what point of suffering must be reached before the official suicide option can be invoked, and also at what point should a problem be addressed in society, or whether it is an issue of personal responsibility.\n\nI guess this second one stems from the idea that many problems we have are systemic in nature, and need to be addressed in society rather than on an individual level.\n\nSo, someone who has lost their job, had their wife and kids leave due to poor relationship due to having worked 60 hours a week in high stress, and then had their mortgage foreclosed, fallen ill and not been able to afford the appropriate treatment.. etc Suicide may eliminate their individual suffering (because they cease to exist) HOWEVER, it doesn't actually address why they were suffering in the first place."}, {"id": "2q6d06", "body": "\nLet's say you're 18, and diagnosed with chronic depression.

Do you really suppose that just because your wife won't go beddy-by with you anymore, because you've a limp and your stomach rumbles, you're entitled to creep in here under my skirts? To go jumping into the water--just like that? Listen, if everyone who's hungry decided to drown himself, our good old earth would be as bare as an old man's dome, just as bare and as bright and shiny. No, my boy, we can't allow that to happen. You won't get around me with that sort of excuse. You're not going to get taken on around here. You're asking for a smack on your bottom, my little one. Yes indeed--even if you were a soldier for six years. Everyone was. And they're all limping around somewhere. If your bed isn't vacant, find yourself another. I don't want your miserable little slice of life. You're small fry to me, baby. Listen to an old woman's advice: live a little first. Let them kick you around a bit--and then kick back! And when you\nre fed up, thoroughly fed up, fed up right to here, when you're trampled out flat and when your heart comes around crawling on all fours, then maybe we can take up your case once again. But no nonsense just yet, is that clear? And now, my pretty one, get out of my sight. Your little handful of life is *too* damned little for my purposes. Keep it. I don't want it, babykins. And now, keep your mouth shut a moment for a change: I'm going to tell you somthing, very quietly, for your ears alone. Come here. Now: I shit on your suicide! You suckling. Just watch what I'm going to do with you. (*loudly*) Hey, boys! Throw this baby out on the sand here at Blankenese. He's going to have another go at it--he's just promised me. But be gentle, he says he's got a bad leg, the little rascal, the quitter, the little damp-behind-the-ears beginner!\n\nTL;DR: I **shit** on your suicide! Eighteen years old is far too young for suicide to be ethically acceptable and chronic depression and other mental illnesses can be devastating, but it they are not necessarily the death sentence that late stage terminal cancer is.

I do however have an example based on an experience which I think would illustrate a case of what rational suicide might look like.\n\nThe person in question was an older man, late 40's or so, who had spent the majority of his time working to support himself and his family. His wife and he had two children, a boy and a girl, who by this point were teenagers.  One day, the man's last living family member, his mom, died of an illness. The rest of his own family, father, grandparents, etc., had been dead for some time, either through old age or illness as well.  In the same month, his wife and children were killed in a car accident.\n\nThe man, whose life up to this point had been defined primarily by the need to take care of his family, was obviously in a very strange position.  He devoted himself so fully to his family that loving and caring for them was, for lack of a better term, his purpose - he was in some ways like Jerry from Parks and Recreation in that while he may not have liked the job he did, his family made everything worthwhile to him. Sure, there were some things he wanted to do but couldn't, but he had long since pushed those away and found greater happiness being the family man he was.  Now all of that was gone.  No relatives, no descendants, no partner.  He was alone.  He had friends, and of course they were supportive (as good friends are), but those kinds of relationships are not the same as the one in which he had been so thoroughly invested.\n\nHe had made a purpose for himself, and now it was gone.  So he weighed his options.  He could continue, and try to either make do on his own or create another family.  Neither option was appealing, even as time went on and the initial grief of his experience began to fade.  He still went to work, he still kept doing what he needed to do, but felt that it wasn't for any reason anymore.  The other option he considered was to end his own life, because to him there wasn't anything left that could give him the sense of meaning and happiness his family gave him.\n\nIn the real world version of this story, that man did kill himself.  He sought therapy, he was prescribed (and took) medication, and tried to reason his way into a new life, but ultimately came to the conclusion that, given what he had and what he saw as his future potential, it wasn't worth the time or effort.  He acknowledged the possibility of success in raising a new family, but did not feel it was worth doing because having a family wasn't what he saw as most important, it was having *that* family, *those people* in his life which he saw as important.\n\nThis to me seems a moment where it actually was rational to kill oneself.  Being rational means acting in one's own best interests, and when this man had tried to determine what that was, his conclusion, fueled by a logical ordering of what was important and what wasn't, led him to think that it would be better to be gone than to continue without the things which gave his life meaning.  I'm not necessarily trying to change your view by contradicting it, but rather making an attempt to illuminate a version of that view which is more plausible than trying to make rational a state of mind which is defined in large part by an inability to determine one's own best interests. I think suicide is a rational course, but is one that is arrived at through a narrow set of circumstances those suffering from mental illness are in some ways incapable of fully understanding. Note that I said *suffering from* - one who is being treated for their illness, who no longer feels they suffer, would be applicable in the scenario I'm envisioning. Someone who is not being treated, who is in their own words not acting the way they want to, would not be able to rationally arrive at suicide. It may yet be understandable if they did it, but that doesn't mean it was necessarily the choice that was in their best interest."}, {"id": "2q6d06", "body": "\nLet's say you're 18, and diagnosed with chronic depression.

You're effectively saying, \"yeah, if I were you, I'd kill myself.\" There's really no way around that.\n\n\nNo, I'm saying this is entirely up to the individual; it's highly subjective. You or I may very well decide that life with a chronic mental illness, or a severe physical disability is still worth living and never even consider suicide. However, an individual in the exact same position can decide that -- given their threshold for pain and suffering and what they'd consider a worthwhile life  -- it's not worth living. \n\n&gt;...And if I can't? What then? Keeping in mind my arguments from earlier, where's the brightline on \"quality of life\" that makes life not worth living?\n\nAh, ok. I was arguing from the premise that acceptance of assisted suicide for the severely physically ill was a given. The bright line on quality of life that makes life worth living is decided by the individual. Like I said above, it's subjective. A life that you or I may be perfectly content with could be a state worse than death for someone else. \n\n&gt;In places where people legally commit assisted suicide, the pain associated with a terminal disease is rarely listed as a reason for requesting assisted suicide. Beyond that, there's substantial research that indicates that people with debilitating physical illness don't have a substantially lower satisfaction with life.\n\nFrom your first link:\n\n&gt;the reasons Oregon physicians actually report for issuing lethal prescriptions are the patient\u2019s \u2018\u2018loss of autonomy\u2019\u2019 (89.9%), \u2018\u2018less able to engage in activities\u2019\u2019 (87.4%), \u2018\u2018loss of dignity\u2019\u2019 (83.8%), and \u2018\u2018feelings of being a burden\u2019\u2019 (38.3%).\n\nI don't see anything wrong with those reasons. It makes perfect sense to me that *some* people may decide that a life devoid of a certain level of autonomy, ability to engage in activities, etc is simply not worth living. \n\n\nYour second link is very interesting and provides many counterintuitive facts. That disabled people, on average, aren't significantly more unhappy than able-bodied people doesn't refute that someone with a chronic illness (mental or physical) may have a severely diminished quality of life and decide that suicide is preferable to living their life. \n\n&gt;No. We should make people who have debilitating illness - be it mental or physical - feel that they are not burdensome, mostly by not treating them as a burden.  \n\nYes, but how? They can see the toll their illness has on their loved ones, they know it can't be fun to have to look after them and worry about them. \n\n&gt;Look at the factors that you listed as potential factors in this \"rational\" suicide in the OP:\n&gt;&gt;the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Which of these wouldn't be better solved by, say, not treating people with mental/physical illness as if they were a burden?\n\nI'm not sure how you could really alter those factors. If you have episodes where you can't get out of bed in the morning, or where you're practically catatonic, your career will be negatively effected and you could have trouble remaining employed. You'll also have trouble socialising and maintaining friendships and interpersonal relationships in general &gt; social isolation. And like I said above, you'll be aware of the pain, worry, and practical burden your illness brings on your family. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}]}
