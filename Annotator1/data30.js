However, this really doesn't seem fair to me at all. Why shouldn't an athlete be allowed to alter themselves through drugs or doping or other methods? Let me explain.\n\nMichael Phelps is the most decorated olympian of all time. Why is he so good? Sheer hard work and commitment, right? Sure, he works supremely hard, much harder than any of us regular folk can imagine, but so do all top-tier athletes. Phelps has the advantage of having precisely the perfect body for swimming, which is almost entirely down to nothing else but dumb luck- an arm span of 6 feet 7 inches, double jointed shoulders and ankles, a disproportionately short lower body which reduces resistance, enormous feet, a slow rate of lactic acid production - and so on. Other athletes have the benefit of an unusually fast rate of red blood cell replenishment- something which is of so much advantage in endurance sports, some athletes without this genetic anomaly seek to replicate it artificially through blood doping. Of course, no amount of surgery or drugs or doping could realistically ensure every potential athlete is literally identical- clearly you will never be an NBA star if you are five foot nothing with tiny hands and poor eyesight however hard you try- but surely if a promising athlete *can* reasonably compensate for drawing the genetical short straw (by doing to themselves what ever it is they deem necessary), they should be allowed to do so, as this will tip the field back towards a competition amongst equals and potentially be rewarded for what counts- how hard they work, how much they push themselves, how skilled they have become etc. \n\nWhich brings me on to my second point...\n\nA lot of those who take against PEDs or blood doping or surgery do so because they think it is some sort of shortcut magic pill that does the work of training for you and cheats the other harder working athletes out of their rightful success, but that's a misconception. Lance Armstrong, probably the most famous recent 'cheat', wasn't some regular guy propelled to success by virtue of the blood doping alone- all doping did was allow him to work harder and longer and respond more effectively to training and thus to outperform his competitors. If we believe competitive sport should reward effort, it seems like nonsense to take against blood doping when all it really does is enable athletes to put in more effort.\n\nThirdly, at the level were doping, drugs etc are worth fussing about it seems lots of athletes are artificially interfering and there's a lot of vested interest in that remaining the case. (see for example: /r/sports/comments/1ia00m/tyson_gay_reportedly_caught_doping_pulls_out_of/cb2jh0q). Surely it would be better to bring it above board both so it can be regulated and kept safe, and also publicly known so that fans can assess an athletes worth taking into consideration their natural advantages and disadvantages. \n\n\nTL:DR: If we believe sports should reward effort, not luck, we have no reason to disallow athletes doing anything they can to themselves in order to succeed.

This is my point about people needing to help themselves. \n\nFair enough that some people might feel like they had nothing to do/no option and that isn't necessarily an excuse but when people are literally saying that the government hasn't given them anything to do I feel that that is putting the blame on someone.\n\nI should of probably been more specific with my title, its not so much about them not having much to do, I am sympathetic towards that, it just the idea that they haven't been given enough to do by someone else, as if it is someone's responsibility to give them stuff to do to keep them away from crime. \n\n"}, {"id": "cn9d5jk", "body": "There is way more to the situation then just cost and motivation.

Doesnt matter you are associated because you live there. A lot of schools get shut down and kids get bussed across the city to new schools. Walking to school, taking the bus (public transportation), and even walking the halls makes you a target if you are from a rival neighborhood. Groups of kids walking the halls and right into classrooms to attack students is common place. \n\nThings like this are what most people dont see when passing their judgement.

Are they just saying this, or do they in actuality or belief have no other options?\n\nAs unrealistic as it might seem, some people think this is true and it could be objectively. If there is a lot of gang violence, you need a lot of recruits, due to death or incarceration. You go younger and younger. To these kids, there may be only 4 options. Join gang A, join gang B, get shot by gang A, or get shot by gang B.\n\nAnd no one wants to get shot. \n\nI'd also make the argument it is much like religion, where your condos environment creates strong tendencies for your adult life.

Here are some insights from that\n\n* I've stolen food from a store. It isn't a difficult feat (though it was made more difficult with the addition of security cameras but even then it just takes knowing how to act and what angles the cameras are looking. Or, the tl;dr version: more planning), and was necessary to not go hungry at some points in my life. Knowing that sometimes you needed to commit crime to survive changed the way I looked at \"being a criminal\" at a young age, and makes certain things about actually having a steady, legal income just a bit weird.\n\n* I was never in a gang, but I was a \"friend of\" some members and even if you're not inducted, it is really hard to grow up poor and not have some level of involvement in that unless you're a complete loner. And even that can get you killed.\n\n* As others have pointed out, in many neighborhoods the real reasoning, and the one that the news media/documentary makers will edit out (not to belabor the point, but never blindly trust media/documentaries to not be telling you a convenient fiction. A related story that will illustrate this point. Do you want to know how to be a great TV Street Magician like David Blaine? Go up to someone and ask them to pick a number between 1 and 100. Guess 37. Film the whole thing. Do this 1,000 times, and then for the special show the ~5-10 times that you get it right and they are amazed.) Sorry, that was a segue; but the real reason people join a gang is protection from other gangs. You might have to do some horrible shit, but nobody can just shoot you for your wallet without repercussions if you have other criminals watching your back. Whether or not that makes it into the documentary is entirely up to the editing choices.\n\n* Most gangs (and indeed, most people) don't go out of their way to harm people. They will shoot and kill rival gang members if there's a war going on, and wars start for really stupid reasons, but this is the effect of giving teenagers guns and drugs: stupidity. \n\n* As for school and a job... I'm sorry, but this really is privilege speaking. I imagine school is a chore but bearable if you have a safe environment to go home to where you can dedicate yourself to studying. In fact, once my dad sobered up and I didn't have to hide or fight every night, it wasn't so hard to keep up with my studies. But my point is: keeping up with your studies is a bit more difficult when you're either trying to duck punches or need to stay out of the house to be safe. Doubly so if the neighborhood around you isn't a safe study environment, and DC in the 90s really wasn't.\n\nSo, no, it isn't that nobody gave us something else to do, it is that the environment we had meant there *was* nothing else to do. When we let the inner-city just fill up with crime, there is nothing else for us to do except crime.\n\nAnd you can pull yourself out of that; but part of it is luck. If my dad hadn't sobered up when he did, I might not have graduated HS at all. Even with that, I lucked out in developing the skills to talk my way out of bad situations, otherwise I could've gotten caught up in something that would've got me put in jail or killed, and I wouldn't be where I am today. Hell, I'm lucky that some of my crimes of necessity (at the time) didn't get me sent to jail, while we're talking about luck."}, {"id": "2qro9z", "body": "I have seen countless crime related documentaries/interviews where people claim the reason they commit crimes (robberies, violence) is because there is nothing better to do and they \"haven't been given anything else to do\".

Also, I'm not sure what you mean when you say that it is lacking in comparison to other states when Massachusetts has been one of the top states in the country in terms of what percentage of people have some sort of healthcare coverage since it implemented it's mandatory healthcare system.\n\n6. I'm not going to try to refute this because Boston does have a deep history of racism, although I'm not sure that it's fair to use people's reactions on Twitter after a hockey goal as an example of this.\n\n7. I'm not sure what this has to do with Boston being/not being a liberal city. It costs more to live in urban areas than rural areas in every part of the country whether it be liberal or conservative. Part of the reason why it costs more to live in Massachusetts/Boston than other places also has to do with high taxes, which are generally a result of liberal policies.\n\n8. While people do take pride in where they're from I'm not sure that I agree that people in Massachusetts are anymore against outsiders than people anywhere else in the country.\n\n9. What ideas that have proven to work elsewhere is Massachusetts hostile to? You mentioned marijuana, but it's entirely possible that the state could vote to legalize marijuana in 2016. There was a ballot question about this in some districts in the past election that had a good amount of support.\n\n10. I'm not sure how having a school cutoff on September is/isn't a liberal policy.\n\nRegardless, I would hardly say that something like being the first state to legalize gay marriage as a breadcrumb to keep an illusion going with this being one of the biggest liberal battles currently being fought in terms of liberal social policies. Aside from what has already been mentioned, Massachusetts will have a minimum wage of $11/hr by 2017. Massachusetts is generally in the top 10 in terms of the amount of money spent per pupil in its public schools. While marijuana possession isn't legalized, Massachusetts still has very liberal marijuana laws. All of Massachusetts' representatives in the federal government are democrats. The state government in Massachusetts is dominated by democrats.

I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially.\n\nI'll make two quick points with the idea of persuading you that, while it should be simplified, a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function.\n\nFirst, take criminal law. Let's assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad. That sounds fine and dandy at first, but who defines what is morally bad? Some things are clear cut - hitting a small child would be morally bad. But what if hitting them prevented some greater harm? Going down this train of logic will ultimately lead to a purely utilitarian theory on the legal system. That isn't to say that it would be better or worse than our's currently, but given the immense literature on utilitarianism I doubt any high schooler could reasonably be expected to memorize it.\n\nSecond, let's look at regulation by profession, specifically bank regulation. If you haven't heard of Dodd-Frank, well, lucky you. It's a 800-odd page legislative titan. I would hardly believe it couldn't be slimmed down some, yet a lot of it is necessary for a functional judicial system to determine what is and is not legal. Take the Volcker rule and prop. trading. That's explicitly illegal now (well, kind of... not yet). There isn't a huge moral justification to regulations such as these other than 'they increase risk and excessive risk is bad'. But who defines what excessive risk is? If you have a probability of default of 50% is that bad? Is 15% acceptable? What about 5%? Even better, what about 4.99999% versus 5%? Some of these things just ultimately need someone saying \"Enough! We'll agree on 5% or we will agree to disagree.\" and to codify it. However, that codification, even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws, would be immense.\n\nIn short, my two points were: 1. We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory). 2.

It just has to be rooted in a stated system of practice and response.\n\nIn response to your second point, you're doing that thing I asked people not to do in my post: appealing to the existence of laws. The economy is a manifestation of a set of laws; if that set of laws were simpler from the very beginning, I believe you would be able to avoid the need for 800-page legal tomes.\n\nThe main mechanism of that, I think, would be subdivision. Instead of saying \"These are the finance laws,\" you'd say \"These are the stock and investment laws\" and \"these are the savings-bank laws.\" And I know those two groups are intertwined right now.

The level of complexity is infinitely adjustable, and the emergent phenomena that arise from those various levels of complexity have extraordinarily different, extraordinarily significant effects.\n\nOne of the **major emergent effects** of a legal system that extends beyond the grasp of the average citizen is that the people who work within the legal system gain an extraordinary amount of power to wield that system in ways that the average citizen cannot predict.\n\nThat -- that last paragraph there -- is exactly the major problem that I am offering a suggested remedy to."}, {"id": "cn91sq6", "body": "If your limiting factor is being understood by those with a high school education, you're going to place artificial limits on the law system. \n\nUnder the current idea, you can do your own research on any legal subject.

Like, most people don't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet. But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.**\n\n(2.) I'm not interested in hearing any arguments that are based in any way on what the laws are, right now, except by way of comparison. This includes the constitution. Seriously -- this isn't what I want to argue here, but I'm 100% on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents, so appealing to the constitution is not on topic.\n\nI'm not a fan of extreme simplification, but I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity. I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.\n\nIdeally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.\n\nBy categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession (medical, construction, IT, and so on). \n\nI'd be fine with memorizing all the laws being a feat on par with memorizing the Bible; but it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.\n\nEdit 9:55: CLARIFICATIONS BASED ON CONFUSION THAT HAS OCCURRED:\n\n(1.) I am not arguing that a shorter legal code is by definition easy to understand. I am not arguing that the average High School student should be able to achieve a lawyer's level of expertise in any given aspect. I'm defending the memorization criterion as a way to limit the total length and vagueness of a set of laws.\n\nEDIT 8:35 the following morning: Nobody last night since I went to bed made any points that I haven't already addressed more than once, so I'm done individually responding unless somebody comes up with something new.

Shortly after the power failure, I got a call from a Comcast service tech (he randomly selected me from a list of known customers in my apartment building) to confirm the outage was due to power and not a Comcast issue. I was impressed by this proactive measure as it seemed to fly in the face of many of the complaints I read about here. \n\n2. **Prices are fair.** Full disclosure: I only use cable internet, not cable TV. For my first year in my new city, I paid $29.99 for 10 Mbps under a promotion. A month before my promotion was due to expire, I got a call from a customer service rep letting me know my promotion was ending and my monthly rate was about to double. To keep this from happening, she  offered to put me into a new promotion for $15 more, this plan with even more speed, for the next year. This move also impressed me as this really wasn't in Comcast's best interest as they have a monopoly on my entire apartment building (through a contract with the property manager, we have no choice but to subscribe to them, so they could practically charge me whatever). So instead of paying $60 for 10 Mbps, I now pay $45 for 25 Mbps, a move they were under no obligation to do.\n\n3. **Customer service is decent.** I had a slight issue with my new contract with I signed up for the new plan. And while I had some frustrations, I expected as much from such a large company dealing with so many calls. Eventually when my call was escalated and I explained my problem, I was actually put into a better plan than I initially signed up for due to my \"frustrations\" (something I didn't ask for). \n\nI've had to deal with Comcast for the past 6-7 years. They had the city I moved from locked down and monopolized. And my current living situation (as noted above) doesn't allow options either. But honestly I'm not upset by that. Internet is consistent and reliable. Service techs are on time. Issues are resolved. And the price I pay isn't unreasonable. Their rates for cable are probably horrible, but I haven't paid for TV in years (as is this trend with many people now anyway). So I think it's fair to assess them on their cable internet service alone. Do I look forward to Google Fiber? Hell yeah. But until then, I'm not that bad off. \n\nSo CMV. \n\nAnd before you label me a shill and move on, please review my post history. In the past 2+ years, I've hardly, if ever, commented on Comcast.

This move also impressed me as this really wasn't in Comcast's best interest as they have a monopoly on my entire apartment building (through a contract with the property manager, we have no choice but to subscribe to them, so they could practically charge me whatever). So instead of paying $60 for 10 Mbps, I now pay $45 for 25 Mbps, a move they were under no obligation to do.\n\n3. **Customer service is decent.** I had a slight issue with my new contract with I signed up for the new plan. And while I had some frustrations, I expected as much from such a large company dealing with so many calls. Eventually when my call was escalated and I explained my problem, I was actually put into a better plan than I initially signed up for due to my \"frustrations\" (something I didn't ask for). \n\nI've had to deal with Comcast for the past 6-7 years. They had the city I moved from locked down and monopolized. And my current living situation (as noted above) doesn't allow options either. But honestly I'm not upset by that. Internet is consistent and reliable. Service techs are on time. Issues are resolved. And the price I pay isn't unreasonable. Their rates for cable are probably horrible, but I haven't paid for TV in years (as is this trend with many people now anyway). So I think it's fair to assess them on their cable internet service alone. Do I look forward to Google Fiber? Hell yeah. But until then, I'm not that bad off. \n\nSo CMV. \n\nAnd before you label me a shill and move on, please review my post history. In the past 2+ years, I've hardly, if ever, commented on Comcast.

Comcast should have every right to purchase another company just as you or I have the right to purchase a sandwich. \n\n[There 100+ ISP's operating in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Internet_service_providers_of_the_United_States) and if a Comcast-TW merger is unwanted by the american people, the market will correct this.\n\n\nThis is not to say that I agree with Comcast's views on net neutrality, but all the other practices you listed can be regularly found at every level of the private sector."}, {"id": "cn9300i", "body": "&gt; You've also got every right to switch providers or move to a jurisdiction that does offer fiber-optic.\n\nI'm going to start of by saying that moving for internet is not really a viable option for most people who choose their living arrangements by necessity of work, pricing, and even just that this is their home and they want to keep it. That said, the trouble is that these major ISPs tend to stay out of each other's districts and don't allow enough competition to really switch. In my region, there's basically only Brighthouse, a terrible connection from Centurylink, or similarly awful connections from some tiny local businesses which likely just rent hardware from the major ISPs. I'm stuck with whatever they want to give me, and that gives them power. If these monopolies refuse to upgrade the infrastructure, they hold everyone back. \n\n&gt; Tax credits =/= cold hard cash.\n\nKind of, yeah. It's called a Tax Expenditure. These are $ remaining in the pockets of the ISP's instead of going to our government because they are expecting a return investment in the infrastructure. That $200 billion which didn't go into giving us a fibre optic grid could've been going towards education and public works. \n\n&gt; As a private entity, It is within comcast's rights to do this. If I go to my local McDonalds and crack open a beer in line they'll likely not serve me either.\n\nYes and no? There's a really grey area when talking about your digital rights. You pay Comcast to give you a connection through their hardware to other networks which make up the web of the world wide web. The internet is just a conglomeration of interconnected computers and servers. If you choose to visit pornhub, that's your right, you paid for a connection to the internet. If you choose to visit reddit, that's your right. If you choose to use IE or Chrome or Firefox, that's your right because you own your own hardware. This is a tricky question, because suddenly now, using TOR or a VPN and going through their services with your internet connection... does Comcast really have the right to dictate what software you use, or to control which servers you visit? This becomes very important when discussing your rights and the censorship that can get involved. \n\nYou also failed to address any of my other points, so I'll add another to the list... you're talking entirely anecdotally. The Consumerist runs a \"worst company in america\" polling competition each year, and this year [Comcast beat Monsanto](http://consumerist.com/2014/04/08/congratulations-to-comcast-your-2014-worst-company-in-america/)... clearly there's a vast majority of people who haven't had your experience with the company.

Another commodity we all have and value is time.  There is really only a gray line between taking someone's time and their life or life itself.  I have discussed how an 'eye for an eye' and 'punishment' relates to our code in society- that I will protect you and uphold the authority over me so that authority can determine 'right and wrong' and deal justice when you are wronged.  You need to stop thinking in literal \"eye\" for an \"eye\".  What we do is treat them like children, we take the things from them that they value to make them rethink their actions.  Even your \"eye\" has a value, what society does is determine the 'value' of the crime after they determine the right and wrong sides.  When you go to the store to buy ice cream, you don't pay for it with ice cream do you?  I pay for mine with another commodity myself and the store owner values, and I give him that commodity in the amount he and I agree is equal (or an \"eye for an eye\" as I've been using it).  \n\n&gt;you can't just erase the suffering you felt and transfer it back to balance everything out. Such crimes leave victims all around.\n\nNo kidding, that is the point though- you can't erase suffering, but transferring it back (in some way) to those who perpetrate it is fair, just, and necessary if you wish to live in a world where you can succeed by being anything but the strongest and most vile.  Victims remain a victim after a crime and punishment takes place, but it is much easier to go on with life and heal (it isn't about undoing history or forgetting).  Aside from the emotional benefit to the victim and society, both the victim and society AND criminal(s) know that society doesn't allow that behavior.  This both helps the emotions or healing of the victim (they know that it won't happen again tomorrow and if it does the authority will protect them) and helps the criminal change his life as well as prevent future crimes by him and others.  \n\nSo I've discussed multiple times how \"cruel or unusual\" crimes won't be repayed with cruel and unusual punishment, but aside from physically and literally repeating a criminal's crime against them, those criminals have other commodities they wish to keep as much or more than have the crime done to them.  Time, Freedom, Money, Life, and they are all related.  I can take your time, but I am really taking your freedom for that given time (even aside from prison, if I make you go to DUI classes, do community service, etc...)..  In the process I am also taking your life, you will never get that time back... In the process I am also taking your money in opportunity cost (even if I don't take money in this instance).  So our societal agreement that we as a whole keep the norm and protect the individuals when others break that- our eye for an eye doctrine follows the understanding that just as economy is a science of scarcity, we humans have scarce, often irreplacable commodities- and society has to determine their values as they balance how they will take the criminals: time, money, freedom, and/or life... Yet they are all often connected.

In these people's minds, humans are naturally tended towards revenge, and that punishment is a natural, morally self-sufficient reason on its own.\n\nI think this viewpoint is not only morally reprehensible, but also dangerous and contrary to the central underpinnings of our justice system.  If we accept that punishment is ok for the sake of punishment itself, we risk trying to justify doing horrible things (imprisoning, executing) to people simply because it makes us feel more secure or more content with our lives.  This is the mentality of an insane psychopath, not \"justice\".\n\nTo change my view, you will have to convince me that revenge for the sake of revenge is OK.  That is, that punishment is self-sufficient in and of itself.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

My entire argument assumes that morals and rights are philosophically subjective but valuable.  Again, though, this isn't a death penalty argument, unless you can find a way to tie it into my revenge CMV *and* convince me that the death penalty is justified.\n\nIf a person breaks rules, we take away their liberties *not to punish them*, but to rehabilitate them or protect others from them.  We might also do it as a consequence of a statute that also prevents crimes in the first place.  It's a flawed incentive system, but it's better than punishment for the sake of punishment.\n\n&gt;Sexism and racism are cultural, not instinctual. Also modern society seems to embrace every tribal aspect from turf war to dominance hierarchies kn every level.\n\nI would argue the opposite on the first point, but that's an entire other argument and we might be here for weeks if we started on about evolutionary vs learned behaviors.  If you want to argue it, that's fine.\n\nHowever, modern society generally discourages, at least in theory, dominance and turf wars.  Most people would say that in a perfect society, equality is something to be strived for, and people aren't looked upon as lesser because of their status or lack thereof.  In the same way, some people advocate revenge, but that doesn't make revenge justified.  Yes, such tribal behaviors that cause harm are advocated either conciously or subconciously, but I would wager most people would admit that they are not \"good\" for society.  \n\n&gt;Yes but you leave out why.\n\nI'll give an example then.  We don't condone discrimination (something that uses hate as a part of it, unless you disagree).  Discriminating against others is something that comes quite naturally to humans -- from a tribal evolutionary standpoint, alienating others is selected for favorably in early hominids.\n\n&gt;Also I struck prejudice for you. That was a strawman added later. Nobody condoned prejudice.\n\nI never said anybody condoned prejudice, I included it as an example alongside hate as an emotion people have used to justify laws and social policies in the past.  You falsely assumed I was attacking a belief of yours, which was incorrect.\n\n&gt;On that I'll end.\n\nWell, I for one enjoyed the little debate.  You didn't change my view, but you certainly had a different approach that will occupy my thoughts for a while after.  Everyone else tried to argue that \"revenge is to pacify the victims\", which I thought was just plain ridiculous.  But you went a little deeper towards my core beliefs, which was admirable, and it certainly made me have to dig deeper to justify my arguments."}, {"id": "cn97xfw", "body": "&gt;\"Demolition\"? These are human lives you're talking about. Human lives who have committed crimes, but conscious, living, breathing people. And you call it \"demolition\" like they're some old building to be destroyed? It's taking away rights, not demolition. Often human rights like the \"right to not be killed\".\n\nThe only rights people have are issued by other people, unless you think people are magic. If a person violates certain rules, like don't murder, why do you think their society-issued rights should be protected by a society any longer? If there's no way to violate humanity and cease being human, then all human means is flesh and blood--the heart of specism.\n\n&gt;I do, I might not have made it clear enough beforehand.

I just mean *I'm* reminded because of how it throws the story off.  \n\nI keep coming back to this, but one of my least favorite extended scenes is Gandalf riding to the Minas Tirith library to research when he suspects Frodo's ring is the one ring, in Fellowship.\n\nIn the theatrical cut, we get the impression that Gandalf suspects something at Bilbo's party, but we're not sure what.  Then we sort of forget about it as we see Frodo going about normal life, until BAM, Gandalf's on the doorstep, wild-eyed, asking, \"Is it secret?? Is it safe??\"  We as the viewer are surprised, thrown off guard.  Gandalf left the shire... why is he back so soon?  It's an \"oh fuck\" moment for Frodo, and for the audience.  Most importantly, **we get to discover what the ring really is at the same time as Frodo does.**  \n\nThis is a classic story-telling device in movies for a reason.  Think about Neo discovering what the Matrix is.  Would that scene carry as much weight if we the audience already knew the truth, and it was just being explained to Neo?  Of course not.  It's exciting because we're finding out along with Neo.  The extended cut of Fellowship ruins this.\n\nPlus, it ruins what is otherwise an awesome reveal of Minas Tirith in Return of the King.  The audience is like, no big deal, already saw that shit two movies ago.\n\nThis is where you'll probably come back and say that it doesn't matter, since as a book reader, you already know that Frodo's ring is the one ring.  But we have to judge a movie based on how well it tells a story, not what you as an individual viewer already know.

No, the problem comes from running away from the person. You are supposed to be more intimate with to seek it elsewhere. It is not irrational to expect your partner to not share that kind of intimacy with someonelese when you both have agreed you had an exclusive relationship. In some ways, it is true that this comes largely from a puritanism background where sex is seen as an unholy act only to be done with those you hold closest, but once again, it is understood by both parties that they ge to have sex because they share a special bond that is unique and exclusive. Cheating cheapens that bond and tells the other person you dont trust him or her with your inner thoughts. The lies, breakage of bonds and lose of trust is wha makes cheating aheinous act in most people's eyes, not that you wanted to bust a nut and you happened to find someone else attractive enough to do it.

It's easy to understand how someone could have feelings, fall in love etc with someone and not have sex.

In many ways it's very difficult to believe the 'it didn't mean anything, I don't care about them' excuse. \n\nso in many ways an emotional affair, to me a huge betrayal, is just an emotional affair. But I'd struggle to believe that a sexual one could ever be just sexual, some emotions would have to come into play, thus it's also really bad. \n\nI agree that cheating shouldn't always equal an immediate break up, but I certainly understand why people do it:\n\n1. they promised to be monogamous, a fundamental element of the relationship, has been broken.\n\n2. the cheater has prioritised their own immediate pleasure over the trust and feelings of their partner (ouch)\n\n3. the cheater has not addressed issues with the relationship, and has instead gone outside of it (ouch). Your 4th bullet point addresses this, but I think in a very backwards manner - you're saying if someone cheats because of issues, then try to work out those issues! but i'd argue that that person has decided to cheat *instead of* trying to work out those issues, which sort of compounds those issues. \n\n4. the cheater either has issues with the partner (as 3) or has feelings for whoever they're cheating with, so much so that this supersedes the promises made to the partner (ouch) \n\nso yeah, i actually think the sex element of it isn't that big a deal, but it's everything the cheating indicates that makes it such a big deal for people when you analyse it.

I know anecdotal evidence isn't the best for an argument, but hear me out. I've had two long-term partners that cheated on me, and I'll try to address each of your points individually.\n\nIt wasn't that sex was the most important part of either relationship; the sex was good in both situations, and I'm a very liberal person when it comes to sexuality. I would have even been okay with being in an open relationship, if they would have at least been honest with me about it, and that's the thing--it wasn't about them having sex with other women. It was the dishonesty of what they were doing, the constant lies, the betrayal of my trust, the vomiting of half-assed excuses when I found out\u2026 one even 'borrowed money for the bus' which he really used to buy drugs for his girlfriends. And can you imagine what it's like to lie down in an empty bed at night knowing the man you love is out somewhere, fucking another woman, making up bullshit reasons as to why he can't make it home for another few hours? \n\nI'm a forgiving person, I know people make mistakes. But cheating is not one little mistake. There are quite a few steps involved before the act itself is carried out. You generally have to meet someone, become acquainted, start flirting and finally make romantic advances before actually physically cheating on your partner. I think most people would consider everything after flirting to be a mistake, and that you shouldn't advance any further than that. However, like I said, I am a forgiving person. In both instances, I forgave the first betrayal because I do believe that people can change.\n\nActually, I *know* that people do change. I have seen people make amazing turnarounds in their lives. It's not fair to say that a cheater will always be a cheater, because they could change, if they wanted to. But the thing is, I believe many cheaters don't really *want* to change in time for the relationship to be saved. What happened in my situation was that my partners caught on very quickly, and realized that no matter how many times they cheated, I would still forgive them. Neither started cheating immediately after I took them back, which is why I thought maybe they'd changed. My first boyfriend cheated on me with seven other women in total. I don't think he became a 'serial cheater' until the third offense. After that, it was just a free-for-all and he did not seem to care if he got caught. That's when I knew things had gone way too far and I was out, finally. After my second boyfriend cheated on me twice, I decided not to get burned again, and was correct--the relationship was not worth the risk. I believe that they are both in relationships now and I think one actually is married, so it seems like hopefully they have changed, but not for me. So it's possible even that breaking up with them may have allowed for that change. Like I said, it was just not for me.\n\nAs far as there being underlying issues in the relationship\u2026 well, there were a lot of those, too, in hindsight. Which is why a breakup was probably inevitable in the first place. Cheating was a symptom, not a cause.\n\nWell, I could have stayed and maybe worked things out with them, but all these years later\u2026 who cares? I'm in a healthy relationship and life is good. It feels weird even thinking about these guys. My boyfriend was also the victim of a 'serial cheater' and I think that's why we both value fidelity and loyalty in our relationship so much now. I guess that's what pretty much leads me up to my summation:\n\nCheating sucks. It hurts a lot to get cheated on, and even though mistakes can be forgiven, they *do* add up. People can change, if they want to, but they don't always *want* to in time for things to be saved.

One of the hardest things about trying to continue a relationship with someone who cheats is that there is an immediate and serious loss of trust. Trust is one of the things that makes a relationship grow and thrive, and trust allows you to be intimate with a person emotionally, physically, etc. \n\nLook at it this way - you make a business contract with someone. They violate the rules of that contract in a way that hurts your interests. It's reasonable to never want to do business with them again, because they violated your trust. It's worse for couples because there's a huge amount of emotional investment in it. \n\nI think that there are a lot of things that couples can work through, and working through an SO cheating can be one of those things.

Cheating is often considered outright betrayal. More than once? Even worse. That means lying, planning, plotting behind their partner's back. \n\nIt's not just the sex, though that's a part. Outright lying is incredibly damaging to any realtionship. Fucking someone else, coming homing that night after being with the mistress or stud, well it's no wonder it's often an instantaneous reason to end it.  \n\nIt's also extremely inconsiderate to a partner's health. Do you know that condoms **do not** protect people from all STDs? Some STDs are as simple as skin to skin contact and lifelong. \n \nThe biggest problem with cheating is that it often cracks the foundation of trust relationships are built on. Often it feels pointless to try to mend a problem with someone who you may never be able to trust again, and for some cheating is a error of un-fixable magnitude. It's like shattering a mirror. You can try to put it back together but the cracks will never disappear.  Very often a cheated on spouse remains paranoid their partner may cheat again if they stick by them, and some people don't want to live that life so they just throw the towel in then and there because they know they'll never be able to just forget about it. \n\n "}, {"id": "2qr8gn", "body": "There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact.

Certainly there are cases of patients that we consider to be a danger to themselves or to others to the extent that we force them to undergo medical intervention. \n\nBut more than anything it just seems like we're using \"required\" in two different ways. If I'm cooking at home and I accidentally stabbed myself in the femoral artery (I'm a bad cook!) and started bleeding out, I supposed I am not REQUIRED to call 911, in that I voluntarily pick up the phone, but 99.9% of the population would say that I should. But if I just sliced my finger a bit, I might stick a bandage on it and go about my day with no problem.\n\nSo the point that most people are trying to say (I think), is that being delusional, even to the extent of voices, may not cause obvious impairments. Can you stick a mental bandage on your issue and continue about your day? If so, it might not be correct to call it a pathological disorder, at least no more so than a paper cut is an injury requiring medical attention.\n\nNow that I re-read the prompt though, I think you are correct given a strict interpretation of OP's question. These are all DELUSIONS. But the scope of the problem has expanded to, and I think OP's true intentions, are whether or not these are disorders, which is what I think everyone is disagreeing with you about.\n"}, {"id": "cn8qvn4", "body": "Is this a trick question?
