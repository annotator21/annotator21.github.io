This long-ass passage from James, and this longer one from Matthew make a pretty strong case that salvation requires doing good deeds.\n\nYou're right. This is why mainstream Protestantism is wrong and in the history of Christianity is a rather recent innovation. I hasten to add, by the way, that Martin Luther hated the epistle of James and it almost didn't make it into his Bible translation. (he similarly hated Hebrews, Jude, and ironically given the obsession of American Protestants, Revelation)\n\nGoing back to your title of \"The Bible does not clearly explain the requirements for Christian salvation\", even if this were true, it would not be a problem. For 300 years, there was no \"bible\" for Christians to consult because the scriptures had not yet been canonized. Rather, the faithful might hear this gospel read in that church or that epistle read in another. The reason the scriptures were canonized was to ensure that the church was preaching the same message. \n\nThe idea that the Bible should say \"this is what you need to do\" is premised on a few fallacies. The first is that the bible is a product of the church, not vice versa. As discussed, Christians existed for several centuries without a bible. A second fallacy, and this is very important, is the western, legalistic approach to the faith. Western Christians want to say, \"if I tick off 1, 2 and 3 on this list, I'm definitely good to go for heaven\". It doesn't work that way. Salvation is an ongoing process that never stops. It is a process of transformation. When John the Baptist said, \"repent!\" the Greek is \"\u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b5!\" - which is , \"change your mind!\".

For 300 years, there was no \"bible\" for Christians to consult because the scriptures had not yet been canonized. Rather, the faithful might hear this gospel read in that church or that epistle read in another. The reason the scriptures were canonized was to ensure that the church was preaching the same message. \n\nThe idea that the Bible should say \"this is what you need to do\" is premised on a few fallacies. The first is that the bible is a product of the church, not vice versa. As discussed, Christians existed for several centuries without a bible. A second fallacy, and this is very important, is the western, legalistic approach to the faith. Western Christians want to say, \"if I tick off 1, 2 and 3 on this list, I'm definitely good to go for heaven\". It doesn't work that way. Salvation is an ongoing process that never stops. It is a process of transformation. When John the Baptist said, \"repent!\" the Greek is \"\u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b5!\" - which is , \"change your mind!\".

That is far too much policing of people, there's some things you just accept that you can't control.\n\nIf they went that far, then you could make an argument for probably many other behaviors that persist on this site that you could make rules against or if certain subreddits encourage them then banning more subreddits. There's just really no way reddit benefits from taking those actions and it would probably harm the site by trying, and it wouldn't accomplish anything because something else would pop up in its place and offer the services reddit banned.\n\nPersonally I think just outright banning things like what you are talking about don't do any good, if you actually feel some behavior can develop into something somewhat harmful, you should be more willing to invest some effort into fixing that problem rather than just saying \"ban it\". People develop those behaviors for a reason, and banning it isn't suddenly going to make them a different person. What you described is most definitely not something that exists only on reddit either, people objectify others all throughout the world in it happens in all different kinds of places etc., it wouldn't go away because reddit banned it.\n\nIf reddit actually wanted to do something about that, they'd invest time/money/effort into understanding why people behave that way and perhaps altering their site in ways that might encourage different behavior, but again, there's really no reason reddit would ever want to do this.

"}, {"id": "cn6uuzf", "body": "I don't understand your attachment to this idea of a \"creepy culture\" that you keep referencing. If somebody, man or woman, presents themselves in a sexual manner (sexualizes themselves), or chooses to display, accentuate, or draw attention to sexual attributes of themselves, then they have chosen to be viewed in a sexual light. There is nothing wrong with sex, sexuality, or sexualization. It is not immoral, degrading, or an invasion of privacy. Simply because people **can be** degraded or violated sexually, or because of sexuality, that does not mean that sexuality is degrading or violating.\n\nI think that you are confusing voyeurism with the issue at hand. If a person has chosen to sexualize themselves publicly, the public has done nothing wrong in choosing to view them sexually or view their display of sexuality. Voyeurism is an invasion of privacy when or where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. \n\nI believe that voyeurism is a violation of another person's rights. However, not all voyeurism is a violation. As a quick example, I'll present two different scenarios to demonstrate harmful versus harmless voyeurism. \n\n**Scenario A:** Let's assume that Beautiful Actor A goes to the beach in a speedo. He's been working out, has a nice tan, and his speedo is a bit tight. He's presenting himself in a sexual light, or at least choosing to accent sexual attributes. Taking a picture of him could be considered voyeurism. However, he is in public, and has no reasonable expectation of privacy. Taking a picture of him at the beach is not an invasion of his privacy. Nobody has forced him to degrade himself or act shamefully, and he chooses to do neither of these. Sharing this picture is also not an invasion of privacy. This is harmless voyeurism.\n\n**Scenario B:** Now let's assume that Beautiful Actor A is at home. He has a nice house, surrounded by high walls. He has a reasonable expectation of privacy here. If somebody scales these walls, and takes a picture of him, say, naked, then that is an invasion of his privacy. Sharing these pictures is also an invasion of privacy. This is harmful voyeurism, as his rights have been violated. \n\nNow, I'll present an even further scenario. Let's say that a beautiful actress is wearing a short skirt and barely-there top in public, walking around town. She has chosen to present herself in a sexual light, or highlight sexual attributes. It is not wrong to look at her or take a picture of her. She is in public, and has no reasonable expectation of privacy. However, let's say she slips and falls down. Her skirt flies up, or her top slips off, revealing parts of her body that she chose not to reveal publicly. Taking a picture, or looking at her intentionally, is a violation of her privacy. Sharing a picture of this would also be a violation of her privacy. This is harmful voyeurism. \n\nIf somebody takes part in harmful voyeurism, then it is wrong. Things like upskirt or nip-slip pictures are a violation of privacy, and wrong. Consuming or viewing media of these is also wrong. However, it is not wrong to view somebody how they have presented themselves, and doing so is not \"creepy,\" regardless of what your intentions are. To be \"creepy,\" one must be violating somebody else's rights or harming somebody else. \n\n**Tl:dr To tie this back in to your question, pictures or subreddits that are not violations of privacy or of people's inherent rights are not wrong, immoral, degrading or violating. Pictures or subreddits that violate people's privacy ARE violating and wrong. Choosing to view somebody in the light that they choose present themselves, or view aspects that they have chosen to present, is not wrong. If it is wrong, then both the \"victim\" and \"perpetrator\" are equally in the wrong.**\n"}, {"id": "cn6tcab", "body": "I see your point.

If somebody, man or woman, presents themselves in a sexual manner (sexualizes themselves), or chooses to display, accentuate, or draw attention to sexual attributes of themselves, then they have chosen to be viewed in a sexual light. There is nothing wrong with sex, sexuality, or sexualization. It is not immoral, degrading, or an invasion of privacy. Simply because people **can be** degraded or violated sexually, or because of sexuality, that does not mean that sexuality is degrading or violating.\n\nI think that you are confusing voyeurism with the issue at hand. If a person has chosen to sexualize themselves publicly, the public has done nothing wrong in choosing to view them sexually or view their display of sexuality. Voyeurism is an invasion of privacy when or where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. \n\nI believe that voyeurism is a violation of another person's rights. However, not all voyeurism is a violation. As a quick example, I'll present two different scenarios to demonstrate harmful versus harmless voyeurism. \n\n**Scenario A:** Let's assume that Beautiful Actor A goes to the beach in a speedo. He's been working out, has a nice tan, and his speedo is a bit tight. He's presenting himself in a sexual light, or at least choosing to accent sexual attributes. Taking a picture of him could be considered voyeurism. However, he is in public, and has no reasonable expectation of privacy. Taking a picture of him at the beach is not an invasion of his privacy. Nobody has forced him to degrade himself or act shamefully, and he chooses to do neither of these. Sharing this picture is also not an invasion of privacy. This is harmless voyeurism.\n\n**Scenario B:** Now let's assume that Beautiful Actor A is at home. He has a nice house, surrounded by high walls. He has a reasonable expectation of privacy here. If somebody scales these walls, and takes a picture of him, say, naked, then that is an invasion of his privacy. Sharing these pictures is also an invasion of privacy. This is harmful voyeurism, as his rights have been violated. \n\nNow, I'll present an even further scenario. Let's say that a beautiful actress is wearing a short skirt and barely-there top in public, walking around town. She has chosen to present herself in a sexual light, or highlight sexual attributes. It is not wrong to look at her or take a picture of her. She is in public, and has no reasonable expectation of privacy. However, let's say she slips and falls down. Her skirt flies up, or her top slips off, revealing parts of her body that she chose not to reveal publicly. Taking a picture, or looking at her intentionally, is a violation of her privacy. Sharing a picture of this would also be a violation of her privacy. This is harmful voyeurism. \n\nIf somebody takes part in harmful voyeurism, then it is wrong. Things like upskirt or nip-slip pictures are a violation of privacy, and wrong. Consuming or viewing media of these is also wrong. However, it is not wrong to view somebody how they have presented themselves, and doing so is not \"creepy,\" regardless of what your intentions are. To be \"creepy,\" one must be violating somebody else's rights or harming somebody else. \n\n**Tl:dr To tie this back in to your question, pictures or subreddits that are not violations of privacy or of people's inherent rights are not wrong, immoral, degrading or violating. Pictures or subreddits that violate people's privacy ARE violating and wrong. Choosing to view somebody in the light that they choose to present themselves, or view aspects of themselves that they have chosen to present or accentuate, is not wrong. If it is wrong, then both the \"victim\" and \"perpetrator\" are equally in the wrong.**\n"}, {"id": "cn6ux86", "body": "I don't understand your attachment to this idea of a \"creepy culture\" that you keep referencing.

Taking a picture of him could be considered voyeurism. However, he is in public, and has no reasonable expectation of privacy. Taking a picture of him at the beach is not an invasion of his privacy. Nobody has forced him to degrade himself or act shamefully, and he chooses to do neither of these. Sharing this picture is also not an invasion of privacy. This is harmless voyeurism.\n\n**Scenario B:** Now let's assume that Beautiful Actor A is at home. He has a nice house, surrounded by high walls. He has a reasonable expectation of privacy here. If somebody scales these walls, and takes a picture of him, say, naked, then that is an invasion of his privacy. Sharing these pictures is also an invasion of privacy. This is harmful voyeurism, as his rights have been violated. \n\nNow, I'll present an even further scenario. Let's say that a beautiful actress is wearing a short skirt and barely-there top in public, walking around town. She has chosen to present herself in a sexual light, or highlight sexual attributes. It is not wrong to look at her or take a picture of her. She is in public, and has no reasonable expectation of privacy. However, let's say she slips and falls down. Her skirt flies up, or her top slips off, revealing parts of her body that she chose not to reveal publicly. Taking a picture, or looking at her intentionally, is a violation of her privacy. Sharing a picture of this would also be a violation of her privacy. This is harmful voyeurism. \n\nIf somebody takes part in harmful voyeurism, then it is wrong. Things like upskirt or nip-slip pictures are a violation of privacy, and wrong. Consuming or viewing media of these is also wrong. However, it is not wrong to view somebody how they have presented themselves, and doing so is not \"creepy,\" regardless of what your intentions are. To be \"creepy,\" one must be violating somebody else's rights or harming somebody else. \n\n**Tl:dr To tie this back in to your question, pictures or subreddits that are not violations of privacy or of people's inherent rights are not wrong, immoral, degrading or violating. Pictures or subreddits that violate people's privacy ARE violating and wrong. Choosing to view somebody in the light that they choose to present themselves, or view aspects of themselves that they have chosen to present or accentuate, is not wrong. If it is wrong, then both the \"victim\" and \"perpetrator\" are equally in the wrong.**\n"}, {"id": "cn6zuuw", "body": "I don't agree with OP, but something you said changed my view on something that you addressed.

When I try to watch a Youtube video, and get an advertisement for something completely irrelevant to me, it feels not only totally akward, but also a waste of my time. I often cringed back when I would get a video ad for a female hygiene product or some TV show I don't care at all about.\n\nWith services like Google that displays ads based on what I care about, I actually am interested in what I see. As a result, I may find games or products I will enjoy, rather than just get flooded with crap that wastes my time.\n\nRegarding the concept of privacy, there's no human actually looking at what you search. It's just a computer program that looks at keywords from searches/cookies, and finds the most relevant ad. Computer software does not judge you. Also, AFAIK, most ad networks do not save your data online, they load your data from cookies/history temporarily to run the search for an ad, but don't save it(clearing cookies or running incognito proves this).\n\nLastly, targeted marketing improves revenue per impression, due to a higher chance of user interest. Because of this, sites don't need to spam their page with as many ads, or run as many video ads in order to make revenue. For the user, this means less distractions and less barriers behind actually getting to the content they want.\n\nNote this is a different opinion to the other post.

In many instances, your lack of knowledge of what advertisers are up to makes their strategies far more effective.\n\nThe intention of marketing is never to accurately represent a product or service, but to build up awareness of the positive aspects of your product or service, while distracting people from the reasons they have not to do business with you.

It is very difficult to market something purely to those who will have a use for it, and the ad company has no real incentive to pursue this limit.\n\n&gt; and does targeted marketing (which is what this thread is about) make it worse.\n\nUsed responsibly, targeted marketing would be a means to limit advertising to only those with a pre-existing unmet demand. However, the incentives that marketers are under are to sell a specific product to as many people as possible, not to sell a specific person the products they need.\n\nThe same information that allows marketers to suggest products that will fill unmet demands also allows them to make something that will be useless to you appear to fill those demands.

But the problem is we're in an era where most of us have become accustomed to receiving free services online that we have no intention of ever paying for- reddit is a great example of that, actually. Something has to give. I accept that these websites will try to sell me stuff, and I keep that in mind. I accept that advertisers will attempt to manipulate me as they always have as the price of admission when I use free services such as youtube or facebook.\n\n&gt;It's driven by the desire to separate you from your money.\n\nAside from the issue of paying for this stuff, you seem to view the prevention of allowing others to try to influence you as a goal in and of itself. But that assumes that as consumers, we would have no reason to buy any of this stuff unless we were manipulated into doing so by increasingly complex tricks. That's simply not true for most people. I'll encounter just as many ads if I use my free time watching TV or listening to the radio. So why would I not choose ads oriented toward things I might actually want to buy if I knew about them? I take personal responsibility for taking the extra step and doing my research about the products before buying them, rather than accepting the manipulation at face value.\n\nOne last thing- an irony of the fear of the internet age leading to greater manipulation of consumers is that I don't think consumers have ever been more empowered or aware of bad advertising than they currently are. If anyone feels ripped off by a seller, it hits places like reddit and facebook within hours, and the backlash spreads across the internet like wildfire. I can read hundreds, even thousands of reviews of everything before I buy it. Even if the company tries to astroturf with paid reviews, the negative reviews always attract more attention than the positive ones. Advertising may never have been more effective than now, but selling things by assuming customers won't be informed of the bad points until it's too late has never been harder.\n"}, {"id": "cn6mouy", "body": "The intention of advertising is to manipulate behavior.

Your main point appears to be that targeted advertising is not good because businesses gather lots of information about consumers with no transparency and will use it for their main objective of driving profits, which are contrary to consumers' interests. Please, correct me if this is wrong or is missing something, because this is the point I'm arguing.\n\nFirst, businesses gather lots of information with no transparency.\n\nIt is actually quite transparent if you look well. We can change cookie preferences on browsers so that they get nothing. Also, all the targeted coupons from grocery stores come from tracking purchases on a loyalty card that can only be tracked if we voluntarily sign up for it. So, while companies are not explicitly stating what information they have on us, it's not hard for us to know what they've got because we voluntarily provide it.\n\nSecond, businesses use it for driving their profits.\n\nThis is correct. So what if it drives profits? That doesn't refute my point that consumers benefit from sales, discounts, and offers that are more relevant to our preferences. The drive for profit is not an arguable point, it's capitalism. That does not at all mean that targeted marketing isn't a good thing. If consumers (us) benefit (which we do), it's a good thing. Who cares if businesses benefit too?\n\nThird, the objective of businesses is contrary to ours.\n\nNow, this is a highly debatable point. I'm well aware of the many corporations whose interests are vastly contrary to the well being of the average citizen. Most of them, however, are not consumer-oriented/retail businesses (which are the ones that use targeted advertising). Retail businesses will not exist if we do not decide to make purchases. It's as simple as that. If we, as consumers, do not purchase what we want, retail businesses will fail. So, our interests are actually more aligned than you seem to think. Businesses must sell the best products they can to us at the best price or they will not survive. \n\nWhat you seem to assume, however, is that we as consumers are not making decisions in the best interest of ourselves because of \"manipulation\" that occurs because of advertising. Now, that gets into an argument about human rationality, which is outside of the scope of this discussion. For the purpose of this discussion, let's assume that humans are rational thinkers and make decisions in their best interests (if that's an argument you'd like to pursue [especially because you're a {I'm assuming psychological} therapist and it would be fascinating to hear your side], please let me know).\n\nSo, at the end of the day, we as consumers still make the decision of whether or not to purchase something and we make the decision of what (of many options) to purchase. When those options are narrowed from a vast sea of mostly irrelevant and some relevant options down to few irrelevant and mostly relevant options (sometimes at a discounted price to undercut competition) due to targeted advertising, that is clearly a benefit to the consumer. While, yes, it *can* be exploited by companies that try to sell crap goods at high prices, that doesn't mean it is inherently bad. Anything can be exploited.

When I try to watch a Youtube video, and get an advertisement for something completely irrelevant to me, it feels not only totally akward, but also a waste of my time. I often cringed back when I would get a video ad for a female hygiene product or some TV show I don't care at all about.\n\nWith services like Google that displays ads based on what I care about, I actually am interested in what I see. As a result, I may find games or products I will enjoy, rather than just get flooded with crap that wastes my time.\n\nRegarding the concept of privacy, there's no human actually looking at what you search. It's just a computer program that looks at keywords from searches/cookies, and finds the most relevant ad. Computer software does not judge you. Also, AFAIK, most ad networks do not save your data online, they load your data from cookies/history temporarily to run the search for an ad, but don't save it(clearing cookies or running incognito proves this).\n\nLastly, targeted marketing improves revenue per impression, due to a higher chance of user interest.

Because:\n\n&gt; With services like Google that displays ads based on what I care about,\n\nGoogle owns Youtube. Apparently Google also displays ads that make you cringe.\n\nAlso, while I agree that it's not as terrible as some suggest, and I'll happily watch Youtube and not panic about the fact that Google knows what I've been watching, this is a little naive:\n\n&gt; Regarding the concept of privacy, there's no human actually looking at what you search. It's just a computer program that looks at keywords from searches/cookies, and finds the most relevant ad.\n\nWe have only their word for this. Beyond that, we can maybe take some solace in the fact that the companies which we're most worried about tracking us (like Google or Facebook) also don't physically employ enough people to wade through all the data that they're collecting, if they were doing it by hand.\n\nBut that's not the privacy concern. The privacy concern is that, if they ever have a reason to, or if a government ever compels them to, they *could* look at all that. Just look at \"The Fappening\" -- or don't, because you hopefully respect that this is a disgusting personal violation, but the point is, this is just the stuff they deliberately uploaded. What about the stuff you're mostly *passively* uploading?\n\nJust as a for-instance, [here's a bunch of stuff Google knows about you](https://history.google.com/history/). If you use any sort of Google location services, especially if you have an Android phone, [here's a bunch more stuff they know](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0). It's a little spooky. And yes, if all goes well, this will only ever be used by those computer programs. But if the police ever want to know exactly where you were on a certain day at a certain time, they could conceivably subpoena that information. Or if someone ever breaks into your Google account, they'll have the same history.\n\nI'm not saying you should turn that off. What I'm saying is, \"Only a program is looking at it\" is not a good reason not to care.\n\n&gt; Also, AFAIK, most ad networks do not save your data online, they load your data from cookies/history temporarily to run the search for an ad, but don't save it(clearing cookies or running incognito proves this).\n\nWrong, on several levels.\n\nFirst, yes, you are tracked using cookies. The cookie is used to assign you a unique ID, so the can record and track you in a much larger database. To prove this to yourself, if you've got a Google account of any kind (Gmail, Youtube, etc), open an Incognito window, login, and look at [your Google history](https://history.google.com/history/).\n\nGoing Incognito clears your cookies, which means they'll have to generate another ID to track you and store it in the Incognito session. Which means they'll have all your activity in that one Incognito session, until you close all those Incognito windows, but they won't know for sure that it's the same person as the ID they've been tracking in your non-Incognito window. But that doesn't in any way remove the information that they already have on you, and there are several techniques used by a few ad networks to circumvent Incognito and other means of clearing cookies -- for example, Flash has its own cookies. What they used to do (and maybe still) is stuff the tracking info in a Flash cookie, and then if you clear your browser cookies, that wouldn't clear your Flash cookie. So as soon as you looked at a Flash ad, they'd immediately notice that you're the same person, and all your history before and after you cleared cookies would be tied together. This used to bust through Incognito, too, but I think Flash has better Incognito support now.\n\nEven with a flawless Incognito, the networks can still notice that you're coming from the same IP address, with the same [user-agent string](http://www.useragentstring.com/), and going to pretty much the same sites, and guess that you're the same person. I can't prove that they're doing this one (though they absolutely *were* doing the Flash-cookie trick), but it's easy to prove they *can.*\n\nSo, at this point, if you want to hide from these companies, you have basically two choices: Either [use TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) (and just live with less bandwidth and a slower Internet that's only *probably* more private), or [opt out](http://donottrack.us/) -- which is the equivalent of asking nicely, some networks will ignore the do-not-track header entirely, and you have no guarantee that the ones that *say* they won't track you, actually won't track you.\n\nIt turns out most people don't care, but you seem to be implying it's easy to not be tracked if you don't want to, or that it's hard for this surveillance to be used for anything other than advertising to you, and neither is true.\n\nI think it's fair to say that if targeted advertising weren't a thing, there'd be far less financial incentive for this sort of tracking, which means there'd be far more privacy overall.\n\n&gt; Lastly, targeted marketing improves revenue per impression, due to a higher chance of user interest. Because of this, sites don't need to spam their page with as many ads, or run as many video ads in order to make revenue. For the user, this means less distractions and less barriers behind actually getting to the content they want.\n\nIf that were true, I'd be a lot less bothered. But it turns out that sites just spam their page with *exactly* as many ads, and make that much more money! Why would that be otherwise?

In the same way that supermarkets out chocolate bars at the checkout not for your health but to tempt your decision, the advertising is deviously there to manipulate your behaviour to go AWAY from your needs. In the pants example, it makes no sense for a good pants company (knowing your surfing patterns) to pay more money to advertise to you. You would have searched for reviews and bought the pants-- so advertising is there to manipulate you AWAY from your current shopping behavior to get you to buy the less nice, more expensive pants from a company who has spent more money on advertising.\n\nTL;DR: advertising manipulations isn't in your best interests because good intentions would mean less profits.

What if a political party gives facebook enough dollars to influence how people vote -- with precise demographic information, they can tell exactly what your political persuasion is and how you feel on certain topics, and target those people that they want to switch votes. This is illegal to do offline, but not online, and facebook has already done one step towards that.\n\nWhether or not they will, or get caught isnt the point. *They have the capability to do this now, and have shown they dont care what their users think about privacy*.

The problem isnt exactly with targeted marketing, but with the data they collect that makes targeted marketing possible.\n\n#1: the fact that a human doesnt use the data doesnt reduce concerns. A big problem with social inequality is the judgments people make based on stereotypes -- you dont usually see a dress shoe advertised in a hiphop magazine, or a car insurance sale in a poor neighborhood bus stop. \n\nA human has to code algorithms that essentially codify these biases. The line between reasonable business decision and disenfranchising an already disenfranchised group is very thin, and taking out the human element from the actual decision of where to advertise can further root social inequality. Oscar Gandy has written extensively on this point, very interesting stuff.\n\n#2: modern privacy is based on control, and allowing companies to suck up all your information and treat it as corporate data removes any possibility of your control. As someone else mentioned, a government can get a hold of your data and use it for political purposes (already being done, see Turkey, Russia).\n\nLess insidiously, what if one of these companies with all your data sets up a 'hiring evaluation' company, that mines your data to see if you're more likely to be loyal or defect to a competitor, or be a team player vs a loner individual? This is possible today with publicly available research, see this ted talk by jennifer golbeck: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hgWie9dnssU\n\n#3: a company is profiting from you existing, and you are not getting any of it. People seem to take for granted that targeted advertising is just the next evolution of advertising, and so we should all just accept it. But take a step back -- if we didnt use the websites with analytics/tracking scripts, they wouldnt have a business. They are using our passive activities to make money; in essence, they are making a profit off of your life, your personality, without you knowing how, or why. How is that not fucked up? \n\nFacebook's *entire business model*, that is, BILLIONS of dollars in income per year, come from peering at peoples lives, and turning them into a data point. On a moral, visceral level, doesnt that feel fucking weird? It is now very well accepted that you cant just 'opt out' of every new technology if you want to exist in the modern world. Just try to get a job without a linkedin, or communicate with anyone without facebook/twitter/etcetc. My political representative is more responsive on twitter than the emails I send her office.

That's fine with me, I'll buy the thing that provides the most value to me, assuming the value added to me exceeds the cost, which does not incur any financial difficulties. \n\nThe problem with this is that in general, people are fairly terrible at making rational value optimizing decisions as deemed healthy by society as a whole. For example, society deems it unhealthy when someone maxes out credit cards and goes into debt to gamble or buy things they can't actually afford. To the person doing this, they are always making a value optimizing decision based on their preferences and the information they have at the time. What usually ends up happening is that somebody will step in either with regulation or some other method to tell the person who is about to gamble his house away that his preferences are unreasonable and try to prevent this clearly undesirable outcome. \n\nEssentially this is what seems to be the most troubling repercussion of hyper targeted ads to me anyway. If you increase revenue per impression and total impressions online remain the same, all you get is an increase in spending. With average US household credit card debt sitting around 16k, clearly many people are not able or willing to control their spending, so giving them fewer relevant or personalized ads can help to reduce the number of unhealthy purchase decisions.

Hasn't changed completely but an automatic system of strikes without human review is sure to yield problems.\n\n&gt; Why is hereditary right less revocable than residence right given to immigrants?\n\nBecause generations of ancestors have honored that right and contributed to society, so your right is less revocable than that of the guy who came three weeks ago. For example, if your child does something bad or is extremely annoying, you're going to put up with it, because it's your child: if you're baby sitting on the other hand, and the child is also extremely annoying, you're going to put up with its shit once and never apply for the same job again. It's pretty much the same principle.\n\n&gt; No one cares about repeat offender criminals. I am sure there is as much support for my rule as for your immigrant rule.\n\nCanceling *jus sanguinis* isn't just going to fix the problem of exiling, it's going to have huge repercussions on the whole of society. It's a concept deeply ingrained and a lot of our model revolves around it. You would need to rethink many things and the shock is going to be  much greater than just having an inconsistency in the treatment of people. \n\n&gt; Why should not this reasoning apply to hereditary rights?\n\nThat's just what I think, hereditary rights are stronger than residency rights because all of the people before you worked so you could have them.

Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions (e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant.  \n\n'1.3. Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process (\"jumping the line\") or to use some important person's recommendation as additional clout for their application (\"came very highly recommended by Bob\") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities.  \n\n'1.3.1. I recognize &amp; appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc. This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier.  \n\n'2. Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria.  \n\n'2.1. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families &amp; backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.  \n\n'2.2. Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region/social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage.  \n\n'2.2.1. I understand that there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have (being tall, white, male, etc.). Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias &amp; may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair - that is what I am suggesting.  \n\n'3. Businesses &amp; societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions.  \n\n'3.1. If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2. This decreases social/economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general.  \n\n'3.2. If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications/character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.  \n\n'3.3. \"Fix the process, not the game.\"  \n\nI understand \"this is how the world works,\" and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms. I would love to have this explained in a way that takes the above points into account &amp; would allow a person to network without the valuation that it is a necessary evil.  \n\nEDIT: I'd like to reiterate something, because it keeps cropping up in the comments: *yes, networking is a useful crutch in hiring because most hiring processes are fundamentally broken, but that does not make it fair, just, or desirable.*\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I recognize &amp; appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc. This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier.  \n\n'2. Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria.  \n\n'2.1. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families &amp; backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.  \n\n'2.2. Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region/social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage.  \n\n'2.2.1. I understand that there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have (being tall, white, male, etc.). Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias &amp; may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair - that is what I am suggesting.  \n\n'3. Businesses &amp; societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions.  \n\n'3.1. If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2. This decreases social/economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general.  \n\n'3.2. If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications/character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.  \n\n'3.3. \"Fix the process, not the game.\"  \n\nI understand \"this is how the world works,\" and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms. I would love to have this explained in a way that takes the above points into account &amp; would allow a person to network without the valuation that it is a necessary evil.  \n\nEDIT: I'd like to reiterate something, because it keeps cropping up in the comments: *yes, networking is a useful crutch in hiring because most hiring processes are fundamentally broken, but that does not make it fair, just, or desirable.*\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
