If you look at the imposition on life and freedoms as a result of terrorism they really don't stack up.\n\nThere's also the issue that torture is probably an ineffective method of dealing with the broader issues. How does ripping people's fingernails off stop terrorism from fomenting in the first place? Torture is a reactive measure - in a best case scenario it is targeting events that are already in motion (which IMO is already far too late).\n\n&gt; I think the main argument against me would be that there's a chance that some of these people may be innocent. \n\nI think the main argument against torture is that it is less effective than other measures.\n\nAdditionally, if we are to address ethical concerns, it isn't that you could be torturing 'innocent' people, it's that you are normalising brutalising people. Your standards for treating suspects drop considerably (to the point that you are prepared to kill them in the service of your goals). Once that happens that will permeate into broader society and what was once reserved for the 'enemy' will start to be used on citizens.\n\nPrinciples are important because they ensure that you don't go down a dark path to places where everyone will suffer. You become worse than what you are trying to eliminate.\n\n&gt; But if someone came up to me, and said three other people and I need to be tortured because only one of us is a terrorist and it's either the four of us or potentially thousands of others, I would volunteer in a heartbeat.\n\nLet's have a little thought experiment: You are dragged in for 'questioning' and after you've been softened up a bit (ie. they beat you up, waterboard you, etc.) they bring in your wife, and child, and tell you that if you don't give up information they're going to rape them in front of you. You're innocent - you don't have any information to give. So they do rape them in front of you.

To bastardise Animal Farm: \"(are) some are more equal than others\"?\n\nWhat about American lives? Is it ok to torture people domestically? What's the difference between stopping foreign attacks and domestic threats?\n\nEssentially, who decides who gets tortured, and for what reasons?\n\n&gt; The people they are torturing are a global threat\n\nI don't believe that at all.\n\nIf you look at the bodycount from terrorism versus the bodycount from military action in response to terrorism, the numbers just don't stack up. If you look at the imposition on life and freedoms as a result of terrorism they really don't stack up.\n\nThere's also the issue that torture is probably an ineffective method of dealing with the broader issues. How does ripping people's fingernails off stop terrorism from fomenting in the first place? Torture is a reactive measure - in a best case scenario it is targeting events that are already in motion (which IMO is already far too late).\n\n&gt; I think the main argument against me would be that there's a chance that some of these people may be innocent. \n\nI think the main argument against torture is that it is less effective than other measures.\n\nAdditionally, if we are to address ethical concerns, it isn't that you could be torturing 'innocent' people, it's that you are normalising brutalising people. Your standards for treating suspects drop considerably (to the point that you are prepared to kill them in the service of your goals). Once that happens that will permeate into broader society and what was once reserved for the 'enemy' will start to be used on citizens.\n\nPrinciples are important because they ensure that you don't go down a dark path to places where everyone will suffer.

You're innocent - you don't have any information to give. So they do rape them in front of you.

It's a space issue.\"\n\nWhile it makes sense for the MTA to remind people not to take up more space then they need on crowded trains, there is no justification for limiting the scope of that reminder to men only, as the MTA is doing with the word \"dude.\" By singling out men, the MTA is encouraging its passengers to scrutinize men's behavior more critically than women's, as if it's mainly men who need to be watched and judged. That's simply unfair to men. It puts innocent men on the defensive, and lets guilty women off the hook.\n\nEven if it were true that 99% of people to spread their legs too widely are male, that still wouldn't justify singling men out in a poster. But, as someone who spends two hours per day in NYC subways, I see no basis for the generalization that men represent an overwhelming majority of too-much-space-taker-uppers. And it's certainly not the case that most men have a habit of spreading their legs too wide. \n\nWhat mainly pisses me off about the MTA's snarky poster targeting men is that it lends legitimacy to the nasty \"male privilege\" narrative over manspreading that's happening online. People who have no direct experience with subways will read up on the issue and get the impression that men generally feel entitled to take up ridiculous amounts of space at other people's expense, when that's just not true. Even if you look through the most frequently cited [source](http://mentakingup2muchspaceonthetrain.tumblr.com/page/10) of evidence for manspreading, you'll find that most of the examples are just of men innocently stretching out in trains that have *plenty of room*, such that it's unclear that they are actually inconveniencing anyone. Yet, feminists apparently think it's OK to post pictures of these guys online, showing their faces, for public shaming. The whole thing is just mean, and the MTA shouldn't supporting it.\n\n__________________\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I am NOT saying it's ONLY men.  In fact, I sat next to a little old Asian woman who kept her legs well spread this morning, which was equally annoying.

It puts innocent men on the defensive, and lets guilty women off the hook.\n\nEven if it were true that 99% of people to spread their legs too widely are male, that still wouldn't justify singling men out in a poster. But, as someone who spends two hours per day in NYC subways, I see no basis for the generalization that men represent an overwhelming majority of too-much-space-taker-uppers. And it's certainly not the case that most men have a habit of spreading their legs too wide. \n\nWhat mainly pisses me off about the MTA's snarky poster targeting men is that it lends legitimacy to the nasty \"male privilege\" narrative over manspreading that's happening online. People who have no direct experience with subways will read up on the issue and get the impression that men generally feel entitled to take up ridiculous amounts of space at other people's expense, when that's just not true. Even if you look through the most frequently cited [source](http://mentakingup2muchspaceonthetrain.tumblr.com/page/10) of evidence for manspreading, you'll find that most of the examples are just of men innocently stretching out in trains that have *plenty of room*, such that it's unclear that they are actually inconveniencing anyone. Yet, feminists apparently think it's OK to post pictures of these guys online, showing their faces, for public shaming. The whole thing is just mean, and the MTA shouldn't supporting it.\n\n__________________\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I guess saying that \"slavery is inherently wrong\" is a bit shallow as criticisms go.  There is a lot more to it than that.  But I think we can all agree that it's wrong. Slavery of a white person by a black person in the U.S. in the 19th century would still be wrong. However, if you wanted to end slavery in the 1850s, you wouldn't start with the 10 white people who might be slaves, you'd start with the millions of black people.  If you wanted examples of slavery, picking from among those 10 white slaves would be disingenuous and could, when coupled with deep seeded racism, actually be counter productive. Choosing instead to focus on the millions of black slaves would not be a double standard, it would be recognizing the reality of the situation and acting accordingly.\n\n&gt;So what do you suggest we do?\n\nWe focus on the more harmful forms of objectification first. That's just a good use of resources. Appeals to \"equality\" aren't really valid to me, the problem isn't equally distributed across the population. Fixing it by showing people how harmful objectification can be would help to prevent people from being reduced by it.  If we can correct people from constantly applying false attribution bias to people that they objectify then that's a significant improvement, whether we can get rid of \"objectification\" completely or not (which I don't think is feasible or necessarily positive)."}, {"id": "cn2be9u", "body": "The problem is that slavery is wrong inherently.

Sometimes people call something a double standard when it isn't because the situation wouldn't be the same in the reverse. \n\nThis is usually the case when people say something about racism *\"it isn't fair/it's a double standard that black people can celebrate black pride but white people can't celebrate white pride.\"* Or sexism: *\"it's a double standard that a man can't get handsy with a woman at a party without being called a creep but a woman can get handsy with a man an nobody bats an eye.\"* Those people are wrong; those aren't double standards because the power dynamics and power structures between the two groups are different, so if you reversed the situation the situation becomes inherently different. You can't compare the two. They are inherently unequal, so the fact that there are different standards for each situation isn't \"a double standard.\" \n\nIn order for something to be a double standard, the situation must be equal. If a situation is equal all things considered, but some people have a different standard placed on them in the situation then other people, then that is a double standard. Most complaints I've heard about double standards in racial and gender situations are bogus claims and it isn't a double standard.\n\nAll that being said, I think a reporter hitting on the person he or she is interviewing on air is inappropriate no matter what the gender makeup is. In some situations the gender of the people is irrelevant, and while two genders may be present in the situation, the situation is not a \"gender situation.\" I believe this is one of them. Yes it's a woman hitting on a man, but the gender is irrelevant I think. The point is that it is unprofessional, and the reporter with his/her camera supporting him/her has the power in this situation, and is abusing that power when he or she hits on the person s/he's interviewing. The interviewer/interviewee power dynamic overrides the gender power dynamic in this situation. It's inappropriate and so it would be a double standard if this was accepted but a man doing it would not be. \n\nHere's the thing though... your friends on facebook are total idiots and assholes as well.\n\n&gt;\"Where are all the femenazi crying foul and harping on that its a persons right to 'move through space as they please'?? ... oh that's right he ain't a she ... double standard sexists.

Most of which were poems.  Typically our results were dry and non-rhyming. The original works sometimes rhymed and sometimes did not, but they were always more lyrical and fluid in the original text. There were even specific linguistic devices for things similar to contractions in English, but no real English equivalent exists. So that tended to take out even more elegance from our versions.\n\nThe funny thing is, usually in lower levels of Latin, they would provide us with two non-literal translations to go with the Latin that we were to translate. Usually these were from famous writers from much later centuries, sometimes even the 19th century. The thing is: those were useless for a literal translation! The two non-literal ones barely seemed to be on the same subject matter as one another sometimes, let alone the original.\n\nMy wife took some courses on translation, as that was related to one of her majors in college. There are a number of valid ways to translate, some of which are super-literal, and others of which translate the spirit and meaning of the original from its original culture to the culture of the resultant text.\n\nThat's extra funny when thinking about how an orc song could be translated to have any meaning to Hobbits. From an aesthetic or emotional standpoint, I mean. It would be like trying to translate Fight Club to tell to French Nuns. How could you get across the emotion of that story if you are someone who finds that story powerful? Or even if you don't find it powerful, but you have some insight into the culture that does find it powerful.\n\nSo basically that's what Bilbo was doing, if you think in terms of modern works. He saw all this crazy R-rated culture, was affected by it, then went home to the Nuns and tried to explain it to them in a way that they could relate to.\n\nAnyway, hence my translation of Catullus had nothing in common with the one by Shelley or Blake or whoever. And even more than that, their versions felt more culturally alien than the original! Theirs also rhymed and made references to stuff in their time period, as well as adding other linguistic devices. Some of the jokes and puns that Catullus made would have made no sense to the 19th century readers, so they were replaced with other jokes (not so much puns), or omitted entirely.\n\nI'm not a fan of the poems and songs in the hobbit either for the most part, and also tend to skip them. But I definitely think the book is enriched by having them, even if I don't read them. It's kind of like the hand-drawn maps at the start of a lot of fantasy books.

For example, did you play Assassin's Creed 4? Like other AC games, it was full of collectibles, but the sea shanties, at least, were worth collecting.\n\nThe lyrics are full of this sort of thing:\n\n&gt; To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!  \n&gt; We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots!\n\n&gt; To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!  \n&gt; We'll all drink brandy and gin!\n\n&gt; To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!  \n&gt; We'll all shave under the chin!\n\n&gt; To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!  \n&gt; We'll all throw muck at the cook!\n\n&gt; To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!  \n&gt; The dirty ol' man's on the poop!\n\n&gt; To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!  \n&gt; We'll bouse her up and be done!\n\n&gt; To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!  \n&gt; We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots!\n\nAnd... it is silly, but [not as silly as you'd think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRTMBDt0-Ac). It sounds even less silly when said in context -- I can't hear a recording, but if you've played the game, this is the song they start singing as you set out in your rowboat to go whaling.\n\nHere's another one, I think a much better song:\n\n&gt; Now we are ready to sail for the Horn,  \n&gt; Weigh hey, roll and go!  \n&gt; Our boots and our clothes, boys, are all in the pawn,  \n&gt; To be rollicking randy dandy-O!  \n\n&gt; (Chorus)  \n&gt; Heave a pawl, O heave away!  \n&gt; Weigh hey, roll and go!  \n&gt; The anchor's on board and the cable's all stored,  \n&gt; To be rollicking randy dandy-O!  \n&gt; Soon we'll be warping her out through the locks,  \n&gt; Weigh hey, roll and go!  \n&gt; Where the pretty young girls all come down in their frocks,  \n&gt; To be rollicking randy dandy-O!\n\n&gt; (Chorus)\n\n&gt; Come breast the bars, bullies, heave her away,  \n&gt; Weigh hey, roll and go!  \n&gt; Soon we'll be rolling her down through the Bay,  \n&gt; To be rollicking randy dandy-O!\n\n&gt; (Chorus)\n\nThat looks pretty bad, doesn't it? Lots of repetition, and those 'hey's and 'O's seem like they're just thrown in to pad things out, right? And that's not wrong, but [here's the version they recorded for the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTXe1ZhJ25o).\n\nEven better, [here it is in-game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOfC1PEKt1U).\n\nTry it yourself -- [here's the lyrics to all the shanties](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Sea_shanties). Almost all of them sound *much* better than they look, and a few of them have these same constructs. So I bet those nonsense syllables, those ha-has, and those fa-las in the LOTR songs, all sound a lot better in context than they than they look.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that, while I think these all sound *amazing,* and while I (and many others) would frequently put off attacking an enemy ship because we wanted to finish the shanty we were listening to, these (like the LOTR songs) are mostly just folk songs. For the most part, they weren't supposed to be high art, or written by a master composer, they were just the artifacts of a culture -- just the things people were singing because they liked to sing, and passing down mostly because parents like to sing with kids (or older sea-dogs like to sing with young squires), until it's accidentally a tradition."}, {"id": "cn2fcy4", "body": "Okay, I don't like it, but you make me see Tolkien was striving for. \u2206"}, {"id": "cn33g1f", "body": "Just to add a bit and bring in some modern context, here are the lyrics to Shake It Off:\n\nhttp://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/shakeitoff.html\n\nThis will probably be more poignant if you like the song but even if you don't the fact is that it's extremely popular right now.
