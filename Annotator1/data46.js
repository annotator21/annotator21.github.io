So we're paying it anyway.  Raise the pay you give jurors and as long as that money comes from the government, it doesn't affect how the court runs things.  \n\n-In the present system, the court gets to use you the way it wants to use you because you have to perform jury duty by law (with some exceptions, like financial hardship and other stuff people have mentioned).  The power of an employee to negotiate comes from his ability to quit and find a better job in the market.  But jurors can't quit because the law requires them to perform jury duty.  \n\nI still understand what you're saying.  But I think raising the pay of jurors is one of those strategies that works if you assume other things - like if you assume that the court doesn't have the ability to just send the bill to the government.  You can force the government to give the courts a fixed budget and tell the courts \"You can hire jurors according to that, but if you go over, that's your problem.  You need to learn to be more economical,\" but then you run into the problem of \"accuracy vs. efficiency\" that others have mentioned as well.  Although I would contend it can be more \"speed of the court system vs. efficiency of using juror's time\" since you can always forfeit some speed of the court system to maintain your accuracy (if you don't have enough jurors one day, just delay the trial to the next day that you do).  \n\nIt's a difficult situation.  I think a better way is for the people to negotiate (i.e. through voting) with politicians or the court what is the number of days per year that the average person is expected to give to being a juror.  10?  5?  1?  0.5?  Haggle over the details with the court, and once that's done, go with that, and make sure the court sticks with it.  If the court says, \"That's too little hours, it's slowing down the court system or affecting accuracy,\" renegotiate and see how many days per year the people are willing to raise the number.  The reason why I think this is better is because after all, this is the resource that's being taken away from us as jurors and this is the resource that the court needs from the citizens to provide it a jury pool.  I think it avoids this: Raise juror pay -&gt; Courts bill the government -&gt; Taxes rise -&gt; More taxes mean people have less income and thus have the right to complain again about low juror pay -&gt; Raise juror pay... \n\n(To make sure that a similar feedback loop doesn't exist with my example above where we negotiate with the courts about the expected or maximum days/year that the average citizen has to devote jury duty, I'd just say require employers to pay employees who go on jury duty or not.  If they're hourly workers, I don't know, maybe make the employer pay the \"daily average\" number of hours that that employee has worked in the past?  And if there isn't enough past history, yeah, I don't know.  The principle here is that money just complicates things.  One would expect that there is some upper bound of days per year that we need to give to jury duty and that would satisfy the courts.  And the experiment is how low we can make that upper bound while not greatly affecting the speed or accuracy of the court system.)"}, {"id": "cn3ytax", "body": "&gt;It really does sound like you're just venting about a bad experience.

All it would do is raise taxes. The people that run the jury office have no clue how much any of it is costing us. The jury office doesn't pick nor pay jurors; that's up to a jury centre somewhere else that usually deals with the whole province/state. If we make jurors more expensive, all that would happen is trials would move slower because less jurors could be afforded, and thus cases would be dealt with slower.

The fact there are a bunch of jurors sitting around is not something that could be fixed with increased pay to jurors. They're sitting around because they usually call in more jurors than needed but there's no way to really predict exactly how many potential jurors will be needed. \n\nFirst, each trial needs to have a pool of jurors to choose from because it's almost inevitable that a number of jurors will be dismissed from that particular case for some reason; however, there's no rule that says a particular number of jurors must be dismissed. What that means is there's no way for the court to know if the selected jurors will be the first 12 people or the last 12. Now, you can somewhat limit how many potential jurors you call into that courtroom because the number of challenges are not unlimited but you can't really call in less than the most that could be dismissed. If you run out of potential jurors, you're going to have to call in more the next day and make those already selected come back for a second day when it could very well have been a trial that didn't need more than a day (thus, even less efficient).\n\nSecond, the court has no way to predict if a case is *actually* going to go to trial or if the parties are going to settle 5 minutes before the trial. If you don't have the aforementioned pool of jurors standing by, you may end up wasting a day because you have no jury pool. That puts you back in the situation of making everyone come back the next day with a jury pool but you run into the original problem again; there's no way to know if the case is going to settle 5 minutes before trial on that second day.\n\nThird, even if the trial is calendared to start at 8:30, there could be delays (people running late, last minute settlement talks, last minute motions, etc) that would make the potential jurors wait until the trial actually starts. Like the number of jurors needed, the court can't predict for sure when the trial will start. It could start at 8:30 but unexpected events could push it back hours; you need that jury pool there at 8:30 in case the are no delays but if there are, it's inevitable that those jurors are going to be standing around doing nothing until the case is ready for them.\n\nThe somewhat unpredictable nature of trial necessitates that, usually, more people than necessary will be called in for jury duty and throwing money at it will not magically make trials predictable.\n\nAs a final note, courts (judges) generally already try to make their courtroom as efficient as possible. They want the cases off their calendar ASAP. They allow a delay before trial for final attempts to settle because if it can be settled, it'll be far more efficient than going through trial. They're not making jurors wait around because they want to keep the case on their calendar; the jurors are waiting around because it keeps the system as a whole more efficient."}, {"id": "2q6wsr", "body": "I've been called for jury duty at my local court house recently, which has prompted me to start this CMV.\n\nWhen I was called for local jury duty.

However there are other situations where a \"gift\" can be a problem.  Imagine being a nurse at a hospital or a home, and one fairly well off person gives the nurse a shirt worth $100.  How does this change the relationship she has with her other patients?  Now, her poorer patients see a nurse doing something nice for the rich patients and think \"she's only doing that for the money\".  And it creates the appearance of favoritism, as well as other issues that cannot be prevented without banning the gifts altogether.  You could say the same of other professions in which you're in the position of caring for other people or their money.  Other situations like a neighborhood cop where they have to decide whether or not to punish you or fine you -- it can look and feel very much like a bribe, even if you're talking about a little old grandma baking cookies.

Then you can refuse again, which reinforces your \"I didn't have to go out of my way...\" point. you keep on insisting/refusing until one of you accepts the others argument. Sometimes, this can be a little tedious, (some people think it unnecessary) but to some people It is important that you politely refuse, to do otherwise would be saying \"yeah I deserve $10 for that ride\" instead of \"I don't deserve the $10\" which can sometimes come off as rude.

That *is* often used as a rationale for attacks on Western powers by terrorist groups, and it's also used as a rationale for attacks on things which represent Western culture or influence in the Middle East. \n\nSo rather than asking \"Why is Islam so violent?\", maybe we should be asking \"Why do so many Muslims feel like they're under attack?\"\n\nThe answer to that lies in the Muslim community's collective memory of the Age of Imperialism. Think about it; does anyone in the Western world remember what happened in the Middle East in the 40s? Of course not, that's halfway across the globe and almost 75 years ago.\n\nBut does anyone remember what happened in Europe in the 1940s? They might not have all the details perfect, but *everyone* remembers WWII because we were involved in it, and, for Europeans, it's particularly memorable because it happened in everyone's back yard.\n\nWell the Age of Imperialism happened in the backyard of everyone in the Middle East. People in Europe didn't really pay much attention to news from the colonies unless it involved other European nations, and people in the US paid even less attention because it wasn't any of our concern.\n\nSo think about how memories of WWI and WWII *still* shape the American and European worldviews. The influence they had on the American worldview is just massive; almost every military action we've initiated since then has been done with the intent of \"Liberating\" people and spreading \"Democracy\", and for some reason we're still surprised when people don't always see it that way.\n\nSo if an event we were involved in that long ago, and on a different continent, is still continuing to shape how we view the world today, just imagine how the Age of Imperialism has influenced Middle Eastern worldviews:\n\nIn 1798, Napoleon invaded Egypt pretty much effortlessly, then moved his army into the Levant. He openly denounced Islam and intentionally attacked it, creating a crisis for the Egyptian people which went unnoticed by people outside the Ottoman Empire at the time, then moved his army into Lebanon to counter an anticipated British maneuver, crushing every Egyptian and Ottoman army he encountered. He was only forced to withdraw 3 years later once the British intervened.\n\nFor the next 150 years, the Middle East was a playground for French, British, Russian, and American businessmen and governments; if Muslims in that time felt like Islam was under attack it's because *it often was.*\n\nThe British and French competed for control over the Middle East throughout the 1800s, but when they suddenly found themselves on the same side during WWI it became impossible for Middle Eastern powers to play one side off the other. The Ottoman Empire, which had been until then, to salvage at least a semblance of sovereignty, collapsed, and in 1921 people in the Middle East and North Africa lost what little control over their destiny they had felt like they still had.\n\nIn the Treaty of Versailles, British and French diplomats divided the Middle East into \"Mandates\", fancy names for colonies, with zero regard for the populations they were ruling. They dismembered the Ottoman Empire, and you get the story that Turkey was what survived the break up of the Ottoman Empire, but even that almost didn't happen. The British and French divided up even Anatolia, and were originally only going to leave a tiny bit of the interior part to Turkey. The rest they divided up among Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, France, and Britain. So for a few years in the 1920s there were troops from all of those countries running wild across Turkey, and the people from the Balkans in particular were *not* kind to the Turks. Turkey only exists today as a result of Turkish Nationalists' military reconquest of Anatolia.\n\nThe Imperial Russian and British governments, meanwhile, had what they called \"Spheres of Influence\" in the Eastern parts of the Middle East, and competed for influence in Iran and Pakistan in particular.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the British supported the Zionist movement in its early days, permitted Jews to migrate to Palestine while it was under British control, and turned a blind eye to the discriminatory practices of Jewish settlers in Palestine. In 1897 Theodor Herzl started the World Zionist Organization, and began aggressively pushing for and assisting in Jewish migration to Palestine, but the Jewish immigrant population intentionally did not integrate with the native population. In the early days they obviously did not have the military power that Israel has today, but they did still have very effective tactics for taking land from Palestinians: They built separate communities, pooled their community's resources in order to buy up land from Palestinians faster, and collectively refused to sell land to non-Jews.\n\nThe British actively supported this goal starting around 1917, and in 1926 it became official when the Balfour Declaration, in support of a Jewish state in Palestine, was issued. It outraged people in the Middle East for obvious reasons.\n\nThen in the 1940s and 50s, the British couldn't maintain their colonial possessions any longer, and lost almost all of them, but they did not stop interfering in Middle Eastern affairs. To name some examples, in the 1950s US and British Intelligence agencies orchestrated the overthrow of Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammed Mossadeq, immediately after his election because he promised to nationalize the oil industry in Iran, which had been controlled by British businesses for several decades.\n\nIn his place, we installed a dictator, Reza Shah. The United States and Britain gave him arms and money to keep him in power, and he carried out policies calculated to please the US and Britain; he kept the oil industry in foreign hands, forced Westernizing reforms on the country which almost nobody wanted, and created a repressive police state. Go team USA? I think?\n\nAnd although the British were responsible for the creation of Israel in 1947, it's been the US, primarily, who has supplied it with arms and support since then, allowing it to continue policies which *still* at times approach very thinly veiled Imperialism.\n\nSo yeah, Muslims in the Middle East and North Africa do have a lot of animosity towards the West at this time, and that animosity is sometimes expressed violently, but it's not because Islam makes people violent, it's because they literally feel as though they are under attack. And in some cases, *they literally are* under attack still. \n\nIt's easy from a US perspective to justify invading places like Iraq or Afghanistan on the grounds that we're \"spreading freedom\" or overthrowing dictators, but from the perspective of someone who lives in those countries, there is virtually zero difference between what we're doing now and what the British were doing 100 years ago. It's the exact same thing, only worse this time because since we have the added historical background of the US-backed Shah's disastrous forced Westernization, our attempts to spread our culture in the region are often seen as just another form of attack on Middle Eastern culture, and, by association, *Islam.*"}, {"id": "cn3eyyb", "body": "I think you're wrong, but I also don't think you're just being stupid.\n\nBased on your observations, you have concluded that while all major religions can be construed to justify violence, Islam is the one which currently presents the greatest threat.

You are reacting to a perceived threat in the way that all humans do, by standing firm and refusing to be driven off. We tend to lash back when we are threatened and there is nothing wrong with doing that, if we did not have that instinct we would simply not exist today.\n\nI do not think, though, that your issue is with Islam. It certainly seems this way because the people who present, in your words, the threat which you perceive fly the banner of Islam, call upon \"all believers\" and claim to speak for the entire religion. What you must understand, though, is that these people do not speak for Islam as a whole. Islam is as fractured, if not more, than Christianity. We don't really think of Christians as a single religious unit any more, they've broken off into Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic and Lutheran and Presbyterian and Coptic and Greek Orthodox and on and on and on. All of these different sects have different ways of interpreting the Bible and the tenets of Christianity and they lead to very different ways of life. The same is true of Islam. There are many ways of interpreting the laws of Islam and the current Salafists who dominate al-Qaeda and ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood are only one sect among hundreds. They represent only a single interpretation of Islam and not the religion as a whole. As you said, you know many people who follow the Islamic way of life and are not psychotic suicide bombers, ergo there is a way to practice Islam without embodying the aspects which you despise.\n\nI would instead say that your problem is with oppressive, extremist zealots who seek to dominate the minds of people by force rather than Islam as a whole. You do not see Christian nations and Israel as a threat because they aren't one, at least not to you. You don't live in Palestine where Israel is a very real threat to you and the people you care about and the world with which you identify yourself. As well, Israel's motivations are very different from, say, ISIS's. ISIS seeks to extend the totalitarian theocracy which they fight for, they are literally engaging in despicable violence with the intent of conquest. Israel, on the other hand, engages in its own despicable acts with the intent of defense. \n\nI think this is something a lot of people forget about, but Israel had existed for all of 24 hours before it was set upon by every one of its neighbours. This, coming immediately following the end of the Holocaust meant that the soldiers and politicians of the time felt were fighting for the very existence of their people. There is very little a person will not do to defend their people.\n\nThis is why the Israeli situation feels so different from the ISIS one. Both commit horrific acts, but because ISIS seeks to expand and conquer while Israel seeks to defend and protect they appear to be very different.\n\nYou're not stupid for feeling the way you do, but I would strongly suggest you do some reading about the subject matter. I recently finished a book called The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright. It chronicles the history of Islamic extremism with special interest in al-Qaeda. Understanding the people and forces which have shaped the current situation can go a long way to helping you come to see that Islam is not the issue here.

The prime pursuit of any religion is to unify people, not to separate them. Any separative action is inherently irreligious, even if it is done in the name of God or a named belief system like the Abrahamic religions. Violence and murder are prime expressions of this mistaken idea that people aren't connected to each other on the most basic levels. It would be helpful to keep in mind that any violent act cannot be a religious act.\n\nOf course, being creatures of free will, we can use (or misuse) religion for almost any purpose. So religion can be misused as an excuse for violence, but this does not make a religion inherently violent. Declaring Islam or Christianity or Judaism a 'violent' religion is like calling your steak knife a 'violent' steak knife. The knife itself cannot perpetrate violence against it's kin, but a human can *use* that knife to violate the sacred kinship he shared with all humanity. A religion is a tool, and it product is created according to the tool-user's intentions.\n\nLike all analogies, this one's utility is limited. The proper use of a religion is more prone to disparate interpretation than the proper use of a steak knife. A knife is a physical implement and a religion is a story we tell ourselves for the sake of guidance. Always remember: a religion is intended to guide a person towards self-knowledge and unity with his brothers and sisters. This is why people that people who perpetrate violence on each other, or exclude anyone from the love of their creator, are not practicing a religion.\n\nThis way of thinking about religion has offered me a much more practical method of understanding the paradoxical nature of religious violence and I welcome you to adopt it."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2q6nyf", "body": "I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yy7d3uf7qw) from Kerry Washington and Allstate's \"Purple Purse\" initiative, and I think they're *really* starting to stretch the definitions of domestic abuse.\n\nIf party A makes the conscious, non-forced decision to remove themselves from the workforce for whatever reason, I do not believe that party B is being abusive by not granting A equal monetary access. That just makes sense to me, especially if party A is making the decision to not work because party B makes enough money for the both of them. \n\nAccording to [Doorways for Women and Families](http://www.doorwaysva.org/domestic-violence/the_facts_about_domestic_violence/types-of-domestic-violence/), financial abuse is the equivalent to emotional, verbal, physical, and sexual abuses, and includes the following:\n\n* Having all bank accounts in the abuser\u2019s name \n\n* Controlling how, when, and where money is spent \n\n* Assigning an allowance \n\n* Controlling all or most of the finances \n\nI fail to see how any of this is abusive behavior.

It seemed like you ignored the really big ones and created a bit of a straw man of the more ticky tack signs of abuse.  I'd say for the most part, the ones you included were signs of abuse, but not actually abuse itself (they can be present in totally healthy, even relationships).   Let me break it down:\n\n&gt;The following are some examples of financial abuse:\n\n&gt;Having all bank accounts in the abuser\u2019s name\n\nThis in and of itself isn't financial abuse, nor is it being claimed as such, but could indicate that financial abuse is taking place.  In Western culture, it's a bit strange that an adult wouldn't have a bank account.\n\n&gt;Controlling how, when, and where money is spent\n\nAnother ticky tack symptom.  In some relationships, one partner may make more financial decisions.  Doesn't really mean financial abuse is taking place, but its a type of symptom that would be ubiquitous to this form of abuse.\n\n&gt;Assigning an allowance **(often very small or unrealistic cost of living)**\n\nThe parentheses you ommited are very important, and could be a form of financial abuse alone (assuming the giver could give the receiver more, but doesn't).  Otherwise, like the previous points, an ample/respectable allowance may be a sympton/sign of abuse, but not abuse in and of itself.\n\n&gt;Denying a partner the right to work outside the home or make any \nfinancial contribution to the family\n\nThis is big, and ties in with emotional abuse, especially if paired with humiliating/restrictive allowance.\n\n&gt;Controlling all or most of the finances\n\nAnother symptom.  Not abuse in and of itself, but you'll almost always see this when financial abuse is taking place.\n\n&gt;Misusing a partner\u2019s name for financial reasons\n\nAbsolutely financial abuse.  I don't see how you can label this as anything *BUT* financial abuse.\n\n&gt;Forcing partner to sign documents against their will, such as taxes, immigration papers, or other important documents.\n\nSame as previous.  These last two examples would absolutely be financial abuse in my book.  Imagine pairing them with other characteristics of financial abuse, and you can see how desperate and emotionally taxing being in that situation might be.\n\nOne more thing.  There's plenty of nuance in this issue.  It depends on how controlling the person is, and how they use that control (to manipulate or emotional damage their partner).  Does this overlap with emotional abuse? Sure, but it uses  completely different techniques and strategies for one partner to get what they want.  I think it's important to have this conversation and acknowledge that \"finances are another way partners can abuse each other.\"  \n\nYou seem like an MRM type: financial abuse is something that both men and women can easily be guilty of.

It seemed like you ignored the really big ones and created a bit of a straw man of the more ticky tack signs of abuse.  I'd say for the most part, the ones you included were signs of abuse, but not actually abuse itself (they can be present in totally healthy, even relationships).   Let me break it down:\n\n&gt;The following are some examples of financial abuse:\n\n&gt;Having all bank accounts in the abuser\u2019s name\n\nThis in and of itself isn't financial abuse, nor is it being claimed as such, but could indicate that financial abuse is taking place.  In Western culture, it's a bit strange that an adult wouldn't have a bank account.\n\n&gt;Controlling how, when, and where money is spent\n\nAnother ticky tack symptom.  In some relationships, one partner may make more financial decisions.  Doesn't really mean financial abuse is taking place, but its a type of symptom that would be ubiquitous to this form of abuse.\n\n&gt;Assigning an allowance **(often very small or unrealistic cost of living)**\n\nThe parentheses you ommited are very important, and could be a form of financial abuse alone (assuming the giver could give the receiver more, but doesn't).  Otherwise, like the previous points, an ample/respectable allowance may be a sympton/sign of abuse, but not abuse in and of itself.\n\n&gt;Denying a partner the right to work outside the home or make any \nfinancial contribution to the family\n\nThis is big, and ties in with emotional abuse, especially if paired with humiliating/restrictive allowance.\n\n&gt;Controlling all or most of the finances\n\nAnother symptom.  Not abuse in and of itself, but you'll almost always see this when financial abuse is taking place.\n\n&gt;Misusing a partner\u2019s name for financial reasons\n\nAbsolutely financial abuse.  I don't see how you can label this as anything *BUT* financial abuse.\n\n&gt;Forcing partner to sign documents against their will, such as taxes, immigration papers, or other important documents.\n\nSame as previous.  These last two examples would absolutely be financial abuse in my book.  Imagine pairing them with other characteristics of financial abuse, and you can see how desperate and emotionally taxing being in that situation might be.\n\nOne more thing.  There's plenty of nuance in this issue.  It depends on how controlling the person is, and how they use that control (to manipulate or emotional damage their partner).

Having dictatorial control of finances and no spousal access to any accounts is something that two consenting adults don't normally do.  There might be reasons to consent to it, but the whole scheme would need to be consensual.  \n\nJust because a partner decides to stay home with the kids (as part of a consensual discussion between them) does not mean the other partner can foist a bunch of controlling behaviors onto them. Leveraging that position of being the breadwinner to get control is itself an act of abuse.\n\nThere may be exceptions to this, but they have to be consensual. So for example if your spouse is recovering from a gambling addiction, you might, with their agreement, lock them out of all accounts and give them a fixed allowance that needs to be accounted for.  But the key is consent.  If your spouse won't agree to those terms, you can't really impose them without it rising to the level of abuse.

This is a violation of a contract. If it were brought up in court the person would be compensated for the tuition paid. \n1. This is already *very* illegal.

Abdicating complete or partial control of the budget to their spouse once married can be a wise decision for such a person, and does not mean they are being abused.\n\nOthers will simply not wish to bother with financial calculations, but still be able to cope with responsible shopping. Abdicating control of the budget and working from an allowance allows them to achieve this. Many married couples place a single person in charge of bills, with this person often making budget decisions and only consulting their spouse over major purchases.\n\nStrict allowances and complete abdication of the budget are somewhat rare outside of abusive relationships, and these can be treated as a potential warning sign.

My wife stays home to care for our daughter, since financially that was better than her remaining working and paying for daycare.

She has no access to my bank accounts.  We typically go shopping together and I can dictate what we buy.  Yup, checked all of the financial abuse boxes off.\n\nThe point that it becomes financial abuse (oppression would be a better term, but that is a semantics argument), is when the thought process goes from \"working together towards financial goals\" to \"It is MY money, not yours, not ours, MINE.\"  I could easily oppress my wife financially by just paying those bills out of my own account and no longer giving her anything from my paycheck.  If I don't want her going somewhere, I don't put gas in her car and she does not have the financial capacity to do anything about it.  If she wanted to buy something for herself, she would have to ask and be able to justify it.  \n\nDomestic abuse covers all of these scenarios.  Calling it emotional, physical, financial, verbal, etc. is an attempt to help someone realize they are in an abusive relationship and work towards escaping it.  This doesn't even have to be in romantic relationships either.  There are parents that oppress their adult children that don't live at home by controlling finances.

You can perfectly allow the existence of time-travel and posit that the universe will simple go ahead and compute a reality that is a fixed point at which point you still have unique history but you really don't have any \"choice\" in what you do in your personal future because it has already been decided at an atomic level for you.  This preserves the uniqueness and linear/causal nature of time.  Alternately, you could simply \"branch\" the universe and create alternate realities that are unreachable from the timeline you were on.  That would preserve \"free will\" but you're just mucking around with some other global multiversal state.\n\nOf course, you could take a more hard science approach to things and acknowledge that most of not all of our physics would break - everything from the laws of thermodynamics to the conservation of energy and momentum if we had any form of timetravel that is commonly depicted in fiction (a person leaves a time and ends up in an earlier one in a causally inconsistent manner).  At that point, philosophical objections like free will or linearity of time don't even enter the picture.  We simply would break our predictive frameworks if we had time travel.  So in a way, your view is correct - \"if you made it back, then the universe has already accommodated you and it doesn't matter - we just need better physics\".  The Grandfather paradox is just a way of elucidating/tying together all the other aspects of nature that we take for granted and tying them together.

I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don't know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had \"other girls on the go the whole time\". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. \"Aw don't worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)\" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.\n\nBut it isn't just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was 8 and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasn't until about 2004/5 that he met Helen. She was a early 40 something year old nurse that lived about 50 miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldn't put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in, of course we didn't object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldn't see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around, who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than 6 months before she \"wanted to get a house that belongs to them\" and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was 19 and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us, never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didn't want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She (it seemed) just wanted to go to work, come home, relax and go shopping (and housework on the weekends only). I don't think that *Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and won't take responsibility!* because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals, clean her clothes and didn't take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about 6 years, she cheats on my father and moves back into her mum's house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left, he looked like a skeleton and he didn't even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth, about \u00a370,000 I think, even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.\n\nThen there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend (who also cheated and left him in dept, funnily enough) and I have to say that he is the most incredible father you've ever met in your life. His son (5) loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him, nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him 3 times a week and has him every other weekend, he sees his family, goes to parks and zoos and whatnot, he gets along with everyone, he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand, while providing him with everything he needs and I'm sure she is a brilliant mother to him, has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about 70 miles away, and there isn't anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesn't seem to care too much, \"He'll make new friends, you can see him through Skype, newboyfriend will be a father figure for him\" and yes, she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this, he loves his son more than anything in the world, and to be told by the mother that you can't see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasn't told her son and won't let my friend do it either, or \"I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didn't tell him\". I'm on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can, but believe it or not, he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.\n\nNow, she is only 19 and she probably doesn't know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I don't know how either but I'm trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him \"constantly going on about it\" and \"not even trying to cheer up\". She is the same as Helen is some respects, lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills, always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the *What's mine is mines and whats is yours is mine* attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt, selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly \"Why are you looking at that girls arse?\" comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it, *her* night had been ruined because he saw him \"staring\" at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldn't do anything about it. He wasn't willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever, leading him into trouble (as Reddit keeps reminding me, happens *all the time*).\n\nWow, this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. [Its like a quote from Louis C.K](http://i.imgur.com/PVZ9t.jpg) Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have. \n\n**TL;DR.

Or if you were a straight woman? Most of the stories that you've included in your post have to do with romances running into trouble. If you have mainly straight male friends, and you and your friends mainly date women, then most of the villains in your romantic outlook are going to be women. But that's not because women are any better or worse than men -- it's just that women are the only people you're going to have romantic encounters with, and any bad romantic encounters you have must be with women.\n\nAdd to that the fact that you may have some unresolved stuff about your mother dying when you were young, and you have a life story that includes women who abandon you, or hurt you.\n\nIf you want that story to change -- and if you're a heterosexual man, you have a certain amount of happiness riding on the ability to leave the past behind and seek out healthy relationships with wonderful women -- you probably want to seek out some therapy. Work out what happened with your mother (maybe you got stuck in the anger part of the grieving process). Work out what happened with your ex -- everyone has an evil ex in their life, regardless of gender; having one doesn't make you a loser.

Or if you were a straight woman? Most of the stories that you've included in your post have to do with romances running into trouble. If you have mainly straight male friends, and you and your friends mainly date women, then most of the villains in your romantic outlook are going to be women. But that's not because women are any better or worse than men -- it's just that women are the only people you're going to have romantic encounters with, and any bad romantic encounters you have must be with women.\n\nAdd to that the fact that you may have some unresolved stuff about your mother dying when you were young, and you have a life story that includes women who abandon you, or hurt you.\n\nIf you want that story to change -- and if you're a heterosexual man, you have a certain amount of happiness riding on the ability to leave the past behind and seek out healthy relationships with wonderful women -- you probably want to seek out some therapy. Work out what happened with your mother (maybe you got stuck in the anger part of the grieving process). Work out what happened with your ex -- everyone has an evil ex in their life, regardless of gender; having one doesn't make you a loser. Work out what happened with your father -- it sounds like he took some hard emotional knocks, and it doesn't sound like he dealt with them as gracefully as he might, which means that he probably wasn't able to teach you how to handle emotional matters as gracefully as you might.\n\nBasically, it sounds like you have a lot of shit to work through.

I don't know where to start...\n\nI'm a 25 year old white guy and straight, I've been single for about 2 years now and before that I was in a relationship for 4 and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don't know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had \"other girls on the go the whole time\". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. \"Aw don't worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)\" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.\n\nBut it isn't just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was 8 and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasn't until about 2004/5 that he met Helen. She was a early 40 something year old nurse that lived about 50 miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldn't put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in, of course we didn't object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldn't see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around, who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than 6 months before she \"wanted to get a house that belongs to them\" and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was 19 and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us, never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didn't want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She (it seemed) just wanted to go to work, come home, relax and go shopping (and housework on the weekends only). I don't think that *Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and won't take responsibility!* because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals, clean her clothes and didn't take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about 6 years, she cheats on my father and moves back into her mum's house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left, he looked like a skeleton and he didn't even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth, about \u00a370,000 I think, even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.\n\nThen there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend (who also cheated and left him in dept, funnily enough) and I have to say that he is the most incredible father you've ever met in your life. His son (5) loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him, nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him 3 times a week and has him every other weekend, he sees his family, goes to parks and zoos and whatnot, he gets along with everyone, he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand, while providing him with everything he needs and I'm sure she is a brilliant mother to him, has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about 70 miles away, and there isn't anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesn't seem to care too much, \"He'll make new friends, you can see him through Skype, newboyfriend will be a father figure for him\" and yes, she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this, he loves his son more than anything in the world, and to be told by the mother that you can't see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasn't told her son and won't let my friend do it either, or \"I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didn't tell him\". I'm on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can, but believe it or not, he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.\n\nNow, she is only 19 and she probably doesn't know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I don't know how either but I'm trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him \"constantly going on about it\" and \"not even trying to cheer up\". She is the same as Helen is some respects, lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills, always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the *What's mine is mines and whats is yours is mine* attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt, selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly \"Why are you looking at that girls arse?\" comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it, *her* night had been ruined because he saw him \"staring\" at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldn't do anything about it. He wasn't willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever, leading him into trouble (as Reddit keeps reminding me, happens *all the time*).\n\nWow, this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. [Its like a quote from Louis C.K](http://i.imgur.com/PVZ9t.jpg) Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have. \n\n**TL;DR. I've had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I can't trust one and find it difficult to respect them.**\n\nFor the love of God I'm begging you, please help me change my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If a line of questioning about where you have been going and what you have been doing lasts more than a week, just cut the whole thing off.  Likewise, if you feel compelled to ask these questions of a partner, and the ordeal lasts more than a week, just cut it off.  This isn't an indication that anyone's suspicions are correct, only that one of you (either the cheater, or the false accuser, as reality bears it out) is not emotionally ready for the relationship.\n\nI'm advocating an extremely harsh metric here, and plenty of people would disagree with me, but I'm tailoring this to you, yes you, with the trust issues.\n\n&gt;woman in general as just overgrown children\n\nThis is because your father was an overgrown child, and that is the kind of women he was attracted to.  You might also be an overgrown child, and are attracted to these women.\n\nIf you look specifically for women who are not overgrown children, you will discover plenty of them.  They will be interested in you so long as you are not an overgrown child.\n\nYou are living in the land of overgrown children, and all men and women in this land are overgrown children.  You will be less sexist when you realize that the men are exactly the same, but because you aren't trying to fuck them it doesn't bother you so much."}, {"id": "cn3ckqn", "body": "&gt;You will be less sexist when you realize that the men are exactly the same, but because you aren't trying to fuck them it doesn't bother you so much.\n\nThat is a very good perspective, thank you.\n\nHowever I must say that I was the one to issue the break up with my last girlfriend and I would have taken a bullet for her. Also I'm not trying to change my view just for a romantic partner, I need it changed just so I can be happy again. Just so I can tell myself that women are humans too and most of them are pretty great people, the few shit ones don't in fact ruin all of them. I know this in my head but I just can't feel it.\n\nI also wouldn't say my father was acting like an overgrown child, I think he was just desperate and lonely after many years alone. I get kind of lonely at times but I know not to be with anyone just for the sake of not being alone."}, {"id": "cn3ckqn", "body": "&gt;You will be less sexist when you realize that the men are exactly the same, but because you aren't trying to fuck them it doesn't bother you so much.\n\nThat is a very good perspective, thank you.\n\nHowever I must say that I was the one to issue the break up with my last girlfriend and I would have taken a bullet for her.

Please do not interpret the following as angry or invective because of the length.\n\n&gt;I think he was just desperate and lonely after many years alone. I get kind of lonely at times but I know not to be with anyone just for the sake of not being alone.\n\nThen you're doing better than your father already.\n\nListen, I get it.  I'm not here to put your father on notice.  People are flawed and I have no problem accepting that.  The reason I have to speak this way about him is that he's a central normative figure in your life, and as long as you consider his behavior to be the default, then your view of women will be poisoned.\n\n&gt;Just so I can tell myself that women are humans too and most of them are pretty great people, the few shit ones don't in fact ruin all of them. I know this in my head but I just can't feel it.\n\nYou are experiencing two phenomena at the same time:  Selection bias and Confirmation bias.\n\nYour selection bias is that you are heterosexual, and apparently so are all of your friends.  This leads to you only being aware of the romantic failings of women - not those of men.\n\nYour confirmation bias is that, although someone else here has gotten you to talk about your womanizer friend who is easily as shitty as these women, it hasn't begun the process of changing your view about shitty adult-children being a gendered problem (or maybe it has?).  On top of that, because you already have this dim view of women, you weigh their testimony lower than that of men (perhaps also because you have few female friends?  You would naturally weight the testimony of your friends over that of strangers.)  Even when a woman can point out how she's being decent and men are being shitty to her, you won't hear it because those closest to you are all men, and their stories matter to you in a way women's stories do not.  You can't see women as people because they don't act like people.  They don't act like people because you don't see them as people and don't pay attention when they act like people.\n\nIn order get into an emotionally violent relationship you must meet one of the following criteria:\n\n* be willing to forego your own happiness for the external validation of a relationship.\n* be willing to forego your own happiness for sex.\n* be willing to use someone's sorrow or self-loathing as a tool to gain material advantage or to fulfill your emotional sadistic streak.\n* be willing to use your body to take advantage of someone's need for sex as a tool to gain material advantage or to fulfill your emotional sadistic streak.\n\nYour father meets either criterion 1 or 2 (or both) and found himself with a perfectly-suited partner who fulfilled criterion 3 or 4 (or both).\n\nNow take a moment and think of all the men in your life who you think are stand-up folks.  Would you forego your own happiness to have sex with any of them?  Would any of them be willing to have sex with you for personal gain or out of emotional sadism?  I'm seeing only straight people in your stories, so I'm going to guess not.  That means that, no matter how shitty they may be as people, they are very, very unlikely to turn their predatory gaze on you.  They don't want what you have, and even if they did you would not be tempted by what they offer.  Only women are compatible with you in the violent-emotional-relationship game.\n\nSo, given that you don't have any of the necessary moving parts to engage in an emotionally violent relationship with these people, you instead have a more stable, mutually understanding one.  This is important: *even if they are exactly as shitty as the women in your life*.  They aren't shitty to you, and you hear about their relationships from them.  You get their side of the story.  They act like shitty overgrown children, attract shitty women, and tell you all about how those women fulfill one of those criteria up there, and how that makes all women shitty *all the while being on the same playing field as pathological victims or equally-responsible shitty people*.\n\nAll of the good women (and there are plenty), take one look at these guys and get the fuck out of there.  Maybe your womanizer friend has fucked plenty of self-assured women who only wanted sex in the first place.  It worked out for everyone, and they exited left-stage without leaving an impression on you.  Only an overgrown child would hang around a guy like that for long, and guess what?  That's exactly what happened!  It's like hanging out flypaper and then complaining that the only animals on the planet are flies.  Why didn't my flypaper catch any hummingbirds?"}, {"id": "2q6k6o", "body": "Or even to a degree misogynistic. I don't know where to start...\n\nI'm a 25 year old white guy and straight, I've been single for about 2 years now and before that I was in a relationship for 4 and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don't know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had \"other girls on the go the whole time\". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. \"Aw don't worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)\" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.\n\nBut it isn't just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was 8 and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasn't until about 2004/5 that he met Helen. She was a early 40 something year old nurse that lived about 50 miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldn't put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in, of course we didn't object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldn't see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around, who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than 6 months before she \"wanted to get a house that belongs to them\" and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was 19 and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us, never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didn't want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She (it seemed) just wanted to go to work, come home, relax and go shopping (and housework on the weekends only). I don't think that *Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and won't take responsibility!* because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals, clean her clothes and didn't take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about 6 years, she cheats on my father and moves back into her mum's house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left, he looked like a skeleton and he didn't even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth, about \u00a370,000 I think, even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.\n\nThen there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend (who also cheated and left him in dept, funnily enough) and I have to say that he is the most incredible father you've ever met in your life. His son (5) loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him, nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him 3 times a week and has him every other weekend, he sees his family, goes to parks and zoos and whatnot, he gets along with everyone, he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand, while providing him with everything he needs and I'm sure she is a brilliant mother to him, has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about 70 miles away, and there isn't anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesn't seem to care too much, \"He'll make new friends, you can see him through Skype, newboyfriend will be a father figure for him\" and yes, she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this, he loves his son more than anything in the world, and to be told by the mother that you can't see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasn't told her son and won't let my friend do it either, or \"I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didn't tell him\". I'm on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can, but believe it or not, he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.\n\nNow, she is only 19 and she probably doesn't know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I don't know how either but I'm trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him \"constantly going on about it\" and \"not even trying to cheer up\". She is the same as Helen is some respects, lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills, always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the *What's mine is mines and whats is yours is mine* attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt, selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly \"Why are you looking at that girls arse?\" comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it, *her* night had been ruined because he saw him \"staring\" at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldn't do anything about it. He wasn't willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever, leading him into trouble (as Reddit keeps reminding me, happens *all the time*).\n\nWow, this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. [Its like a quote from Louis C.K](http://i.imgur.com/PVZ9t.jpg) Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have. \n\n**TL;DR. I've had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I can't trust one and find it difficult to respect them.**\n\nFor the love of God I'm begging you, please help me change my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Like her mother did for her father near the end of his life, Campos took care of her own husband Enrique in the years following an accident where he was injured from a fall on the job at the North Dakota Mill and Elevator.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**[Brisbane storm: Brave woman risks life to save stranger knocked unconscious by giant hailstone](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brisbane-storm-brave-woman-risks-4712068)**\n\n&gt;A brave woman was left bloodied and bruised following a dramatic solo-rescue effort in one of the worst storms to hit Brisbane in decades.\n\n&gt;One Brisbane resident, Danni Suriano, risked her life battling the worst of the weather to save a man who had been knocked out by a gigantic hailstone.\n\n&gt;She had been driving her car through the storm when she spotted the man, who had passed out in his vehicle.\n\n&gt;\u201cI had to run 15 metres to grab this guy and drag his limp body on my own as he was hit in the head with hail, massive gash on his head, and the cars right next to him just looked out of their windows.\n\n&gt;\u201cGot him into the car, turned him on his side and just laid over him because the back windscreen was smashed and we were still getting pelted!\n\n&gt;\u201cAmbulance said he\u2019d probably be dead if I hadn\u2019t got his tongue out of his throat.\"\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**[The brave women fighting for Afghanistan's future](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30371920)**\n\n&gt;Taller than her classmates, when she waves a small Afghan flag, it flutters above a sea of white headscarves in the courtyard of the Zarghuna Girls' School in Kabul.\n\n&gt;\"I'm proud of my flag, and proud to go to school, so I can build my country,\" she declares as she approaches me at the start of the school day on a chilly winter morning in Kabul.\n\n&gt;To advance women's rights, education is fundamental which is why the scenes at schools like Zarghuna in Kabul are so significant.\n\n&gt;When the impressive Rita Faizi takes me along to her English class, I ask what seems like a whole classroom of confident girls whether they fear the return of the Taliban which once banned their education.\n\n&gt;\"With our knowledge, with our education, we want to defeat them,\" rises the defiant young chorus from the neat rows of wooden desks.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n&gt;**[This Generous Woman Used Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us To Help Spread The Holiday Spirit](http://www.mtv.com/news/2025461/toys-r-us-layaway-accounts-paid-off/)**\n\n&gt;A woman with a big holiday heart went into a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us store in Bellingham, Massachusettss on Wednesday (December 10) and paid off every single layaway balance at the store.\n\n&gt;According to ABC News, the anonymous \u201cLayaway Angel\u201d paid $20,000 to give about 150 customers with items on layaway an early Christmas present.\n\n&gt;\u201cThis incredible act of kindness is a true illustration of holiday giving at its best,\u201d Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us said in a statement.\n\n&gt;While the older woman, who employees described as \u201cbubbly,\u201d didn\u2019t want her name in the headlines for her good deed, she did share that she \u201cwould sleep better at night knowing the accounts had been paid.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cIf you have it, give it,\u201d the angel told the store manager after giving her a hug.\n\n------------------------------\n\n&gt;**[Volunteer was 'very generous lady'](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/queenstown-lakes/325881/volunteer-was-very-generous-lady)**\n\n&gt;Volunteering circles in Wanaka have been left devastated by the death of one of the town's most valued volunteers, Maureen Anne ''Mo'' Schofield.\n\n&gt;She volunteered for many community groups and events and has been remembered fondly for her kindness and generosity.\n\n&gt;''She was a very generous lady ... With senior citizens, she's put years into helping the group and caring for the members with driving them around, providing baking, working in the kitchen and also support for members at a more personal level,'' Mrs Fitzgerald said.\n\n&gt;''Mo always helped other people and had great empathy with the older members of our community ... she was a true community person. Mo will be missed by so many people.''\n\n&gt;''She was always happy to do anything and everything, always with a big smile, huge energy and vibrancy, a very thoughtful and kind person ... there were always lots of laughs, never a dull moment ... she was just very giving of her time.''\n\n&gt;It is understood Mrs Schofield volunteered at several Warbirds Over Wanaka international airshows before being appointed in May last year to the role of volunteer manager for this year's show, recruiting and organising about 300 helpers.\n\n&gt;Working at London's Gatwick Airport, living in Africa for 20 years and having a love of Spitfire aircraft made Mrs Schofield a perfect choice for the role, show organisers said at the time of her appointment.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd just ooone more homecoming video, cause if these don't make you FEEL then idk what will!

I don't know where to start...\n\nI'm a 25 year old white guy and straight, I've been single for about 2 years now and before that I was in a relationship for 4 and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don't know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had \"other girls on the go the whole time\". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. \"Aw don't worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)\" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.\n\nBut it isn't just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was 8 and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasn't until about 2004/5 that he met Helen. She was a early 40 something year old nurse that lived about 50 miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldn't put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in, of course we didn't object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldn't see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around, who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than 6 months before she \"wanted to get a house that belongs to them\" and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was 19 and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us, never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didn't want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She (it seemed) just wanted to go to work, come home, relax and go shopping (and housework on the weekends only). I don't think that *Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and won't take responsibility!* because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals, clean her clothes and didn't take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about 6 years, she cheats on my father and moves back into her mum's house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left, he looked like a skeleton and he didn't even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth, about \u00a370,000 I think, even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.\n\nThen there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend (who also cheated and left him in dept, funnily enough) and I have to say that he is the most incredible father you've ever met in your life. His son (5) loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him, nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him 3 times a week and has him every other weekend, he sees his family, goes to parks and zoos and whatnot, he gets along with everyone, he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand, while providing him with everything he needs and I'm sure she is a brilliant mother to him, has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about 70 miles away, and there isn't anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesn't seem to care too much, \"He'll make new friends, you can see him through Skype, newboyfriend will be a father figure for him\" and yes, she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this, he loves his son more than anything in the world, and to be told by the mother that you can't see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasn't told her son and won't let my friend do it either, or \"I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didn't tell him\". I'm on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can, but believe it or not, he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.\n\nNow, she is only 19 and she probably doesn't know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I don't know how either but I'm trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him \"constantly going on about it\" and \"not even trying to cheer up\". She is the same as Helen is some respects, lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills, always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the *What's mine is mines and whats is yours is mine* attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt, selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly \"Why are you looking at that girls arse?\" comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it, *her* night had been ruined because he saw him \"staring\" at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldn't do anything about it. He wasn't willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever, leading him into trouble (as Reddit keeps reminding me, happens *all the time*).\n\nWow, this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. [Its like a quote from Louis C.K](http://i.imgur.com/PVZ9t.jpg) Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have. \n\n**TL;DR. I've had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I can't trust one and find it difficult to respect them.**\n\nFor the love of God I'm begging you, please help me change my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

My last ex slept with someone else while I was in the depths of a very serious bout of depression, told me over the phone before breaking up with me.
