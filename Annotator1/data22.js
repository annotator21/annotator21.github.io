In fact, I remember seeing it on my feeds for days while I don't remember hearing anything about Elton in a long while.  In fact, I haven't read an article on gay marriage in weeks, but I read about that trans girl at least a couple of times.  Keep in mind I'm not gay and I merely classify myself as a humanist and nothing else.  The reach is there.  It's just not there in your neighborhood right now.\n\nLook, I understand how you feel.  When everyone busts a nut about something in the news, I wonder the same thing.  Is Kim Kardashian's ass REALLY worth the media bandwidth?  Couldn't we be using our collective brain power to discuss and solve more important problems?  Problems that affect the livelihood of others?  \n\nThe problem with that sort of thinking is that everyone has a different bias on what's important.  That's why the media content getting served to you is different from me.  You got a serving of Elton John and gay marriage.  I got a serving of the suicide note from the trans girl.  \n\nYour problem, in the end, has nothing to do with gay marriage actually overshadowing other LGBT issues. \n\nYour problem is with the media and how they go about choosing the content that you end up seeing on a daily basis and since there are referendums being passed in your area, you're WAY more likely to hear about that than an American trans girl that committed suicide and left a poignant letter on tubmlr."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2qzudy", "body": "Although there is something kind of special about owning a physical copy of a favorite movie or album, I no longer see any reason to purchase a piece of physical media in today's world of technology that includes such a vast array of services.

Does Wednesday actually \u201cbelong\u201d to the deity Woden? No, but that\u2019s what the name Wednesday suggests. If Jesus never existed, which is a real possibility, then he was never really born, and the epoch is based on an entirely mythical religious reference akin to an English-language day of the week. Plus the word Christ means \"Messiah\", so BC means before the Christian Messiah, not before a historical person. AD has the same implication in \"Lord\".\n\nBCE and CE are no more \u201chistorically appropriate\u201d than BC and AD are. Both sets of acronyms are used to reference years within the scheme of a 6th-century attempt to date years from the birth of a Christian deity, thus having cultural significance, not scientific or historical significance. One set of acronyms directly references this origin and are the naturally-occurring terms, while the other throws all connotations out in a move that can hardly be seen as less than revisionist. \u201cChristian Era\u201d would have been acceptable, but \u201cCommon\u201d makes no sense. Common to whom? Why?\n\nAs for BC and AD giving implicit expression to Christian-derived cultural terms, it is again no different than giving such expression to pagan terms seen in the weekdays and months, which are referenced ***far more often*** (try every single day) than BC and AD. When someone suggests changing Thor's Day (\"Thursday\") to \"Common Era Weekday #4\", get back to me.\n\n-----\n     Not everyone is Christian, so for non-christians it is silly to expect \n     them to refer to a year as being 2015 AD or \"In the Year of the Lord\" \n     when Jesus Christ is not their Lord.\n-----\n\nAs mentioned, our Western calendar has days, months and years named for various historical and persisting Western religions, ranging from Christianity to Norse and Roman paganism. If a non-pagan sees nothing wrong with referring to all of the days of the week using names honoring pagan gods and god-like objects, then why is Christianity any different? The fact that Christianity is still a major religious sect should have no effect whatsoever on someone who doesn't give Christianity any more credence than paganism anyhow.\n\n*/ENDQUESTIONS*\n\nAny other arguments are welcome, I'll be sure to respond.

The term most often used to denote years prior to 2,014 years ago is \"BC\", standing for Before Christ, a direct English-language reference.\n\nBut in academia, the scientific community and elsewhere there is an increased tendency to favor the usage of \"BCE\" (Before Common Era) to replace BC, and \"CE\" (Common Era) to replace AD. This is claimed to be used for several reasons, all of which I disagree with (from arguments I've seen so far). Please CMV regarding any or all of these points, or any other points you may think of.\n\nHere's my responses to the common arguments:\n\n-----\n     Jesus Christ was not really born at the epoch of this calendrical era, \n     and using CE/BCE is more historically and scientifically appropriate.\n-----\n\nWhile it is true that a historical Jesus was more likely to have been born closer to 5 BC than to 1 BC or 1 AD, this is irrelevant to the argument at hand. Does Wednesday actually \u201cbelong\u201d to the deity Woden? No, but that\u2019s what the name Wednesday suggests. If Jesus never existed, which is a real possibility, then he was never really born, and the epoch is based on an entirely mythical religious reference akin to an English-language day of the week. Plus the word Christ means \"Messiah\", so BC means before the Christian Messiah, not before a historical person. AD has the same implication in \"Lord\".\n\nBCE and CE are no more \u201chistorically appropriate\u201d than BC and AD are. Both sets of acronyms are used to reference years within the scheme of a 6th-century attempt to date years from the birth of a Christian deity, thus having cultural significance, not scientific or historical significance. One set of acronyms directly references this origin and are the naturally-occurring terms, while the other throws all connotations out in a move that can hardly be seen as less than revisionist. \u201cChristian Era\u201d would have been acceptable, but \u201cCommon\u201d makes no sense. Common to whom? Why?\n\nAs for BC and AD giving implicit expression to Christian-derived cultural terms, it is again no different than giving such expression to pagan terms seen in the weekdays and months, which are referenced ***far more often*** (try every single day) than BC and AD. When someone suggests changing Thor's Day (\"Thursday\") to \"Common Era Weekday #4\", get back to me.\n\n-----\n     Not everyone is Christian, so for non-christians it is silly to expect \n     them to refer to a year as being 2015 AD or \"In the Year of the Lord\" \n     when Jesus Christ is not their Lord.\n-----\n\nAs mentioned, our Western calendar has days, months and years named for various historical and persisting Western religions, ranging from Christianity to Norse and Roman paganism. If a non-pagan sees nothing wrong with referring to all of the days of the week using names honoring pagan gods and god-like objects, then why is Christianity any different? The fact that Christianity is still a major religious sect should have no effect whatsoever on someone who doesn't give Christianity any more credence than paganism anyhow.\n\n*/ENDQUESTIONS*\n\nAny other arguments are welcome, I'll be sure to respond. My main reason for posting this is that on Reddit/the Internet in general, I often get patronizingly told to use BCE/CE instead of BC/AD when I use the latter, so I'm certainly interested in hearing why I'm wrong here, and perhaps my mind can be swayed. I know this topic is ultimately trivial, but it speaks to the heart of so many debates and arguments within our society: RELIGION and POLITICS!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Renaming these in all languages to something sequential like \"Day One\", etc. would easily rid of all religious connotations.\n\nRenaming all the pagan references in all languages to sequential days would be going against centuries of conventional usage and would quickly fail. Changing from BC/AD to BCE/CE keeps the dating system functionally the same except for the abbreviation. Let\u2019s not make the false equivalence that they\u2019re the same. \n\nA dating system reform on the level of the absurd language reforms that you\u2019re suggesting would be something such as choosing that what\u2019s now 27 BCE (the year the Roman Empire was formed) as the new 1 CE to entire uncouple the dating system from the traditional calculations of when Christ was born.\n\n&gt; As mentioned it would affect all languages that have pagan gods behind the names... more than just English, but admittedly not all languages. Yes switching the days of the week would be super confusing to English speakers because it would introduce an unnecessary secular change to get rid if an innocuous religious reference, but I'm arguing the same is true of BC/AD and they shouldn't be replaced.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about the practicalities of introducing new names for days of the week vs. new abbreviations for dating years above. Another false equivalence that you\u2019re making is that the two religions are equally innocuous. All pagan references in language are actually innocuous references to the cultural heritage of the language because paganism isn\u2019t a serious religion anymore for quite some time. \n\nOn the other hand, Christianity is the world\u2019s largest religion, and the dominant religion in most countries except those in North Africa, Asia, and SE Asia. Hence in some cases, using BC/AD actually amounts to imposing Christianity on non-Christians, and could turn those non-Christians against the study of history. \n\n&gt; As said in the OP I wouldn't have an issue if it were called \"Christian Era\" or \"After Christ\", it's the euphemistic nature of the \"Common\" terminology that I am against as I feel it goes against the spirit of education and history to use such a generic term for such an important feature of our society and culture that has an origin in something significant to history. \n\n\nI would think that either \u201cChristian Era\u201d or \u201cAfter Christ\u201d would be significantly worse choices than \u201cCommon Era\u201d because it is no longer a centuries long traditional way of denoting years and more explicitly references the Christian religion compared to AD, which requires either an understanding of the dating abbreviations or Latin knowledge to understand the Christian connotations.\n\nThere are many dating systems that meet your criteria of being socio-culturally important and historically significant (e.g. the Jewish calendar dated from when they believe the Earth was created, the Islamic calendar dated from Muhammad\u2019s 662 CE hirja, traditional Chinese calendars dated according to the number of years the current emperor reigned), yet none of them are as internationally accepted as the Western, very-Christian inspired system that we use today. It\u2019s called the \u201cCommon Era\u201d because the use of the Western calendar has become the de facto date system for the world. \u201cCommon Era,\u201d while euphemistic, does pay its due to the importance of this very Christian calendar. Is it really still necessary to insist that historians who are of other faiths or who are atheists use date abbreviations that refer to the Christian creed that Jesus was the Christ?\n\n&gt; I haven't even mentioned the practical advantages of BC/AD which I also feel exist... the visual and audio similarity of BCE to CE is jarring, and BCE is clunky at 3 letters. Overall it's just an awkward circumlocution that seems to be entirely superfluous and, if anything, often brings unnecessary attention to the subject matter its supporters seem to want to obscure.\n\nYou could make arguments for the superiority of BCE/CE just as easily. The similarity of BCE/CE makes it easier to teach to new history students than the BC/AD system which doesn\u2019t share any term and is in two languages, including Latin which no one speaks conversationally. The traditional use of BC/AD also has BC follow the year and AD preceded it, while both BCE and CE follow the year number. A extra letter is merely a minor inconvenience. If it was a Christian-influenced BCE/CE (say \u201cBefore Christ\u2019s Emergence\u201d and \u201cChrist\u2019s Emergence\u201d) being replaced by a more secular BC/AD system (say \u201cBefore Contemporary\" and \u201cAfter Dating\u201d), you would probably argue for BCE/CE just because that\u2019s what you\u2019re used to.\n"}, {"id": "2qzlr5", "body": "I thought it appropriate timing to post this CMV as we change from the year 2014 AD (or is that \"CE\"?) to 2015 in the near-universal Gregorian calendar across each timezone of the world.\n\nAs you may or may not know, the current year counts upward from a medieval Christian monk's (Dionysius Exiguus) estimation of the birth year of Jesus Christ (c. December 25, 1 BC), popularized in Western Europe as the dominant era system throughout the latter half of the first millennium and cemented as the de facto year system by the mid-20th century, even in non-Western nations. The acronym most familiarly used to denote the current year and distinguish it from years going back over 2,014 years ago is \"AD\", standing for *Anno Domini*, a Latin phrase translating to \"In the Year of the Lord\". The term most often used to denote years prior to 2,014 years ago is \"BC\", standing for Before Christ, a direct English-language reference.\n\nBut in academia, the scientific community and elsewhere there is an increased tendency to favor the usage of \"BCE\" (Before Common Era) to replace BC, and \"CE\" (Common Era) to replace AD. This is claimed to be used for several reasons, all of which I disagree with (from arguments I've seen so far). Please CMV regarding any or all of these points, or any other points you may think of.\n\nHere's my responses to the common arguments:\n\n-----\n     Jesus Christ was not really born at the epoch of this calendrical era, \n     and using CE/BCE is more historically and scientifically appropriate.\n-----\n\nWhile it is true that a historical Jesus was more likely to have been born closer to 5 BC than to 1 BC or 1 AD, this is irrelevant to the argument at hand. Does Wednesday actually \u201cbelong\u201d to the deity Woden? No, but that\u2019s what the name Wednesday suggests. If Jesus never existed, which is a real possibility, then he was never really born, and the epoch is based on an entirely mythical religious reference akin to an English-language day of the week. Plus the word Christ means \"Messiah\", so BC means before the Christian Messiah, not before a historical person. AD has the same implication in \"Lord\".\n\nBCE and CE are no more \u201chistorically appropriate\u201d than BC and AD are. Both sets of acronyms are used to reference years within the scheme of a 6th-century attempt to date years from the birth of a Christian deity, thus having cultural significance, not scientific or historical significance. One set of acronyms directly references this origin and are the naturally-occurring terms, while the other throws all connotations out in a move that can hardly be seen as less than revisionist. \u201cChristian Era\u201d would have been acceptable, but \u201cCommon\u201d makes no sense. Common to whom? Why?\n\nAs for BC and AD giving implicit expression to Christian-derived cultural terms, it is again no different than giving such expression to pagan terms seen in the weekdays and months, which are referenced ***far more often*** (try every single day) than BC and AD. When someone suggests changing Thor's Day (\"Thursday\") to \"Common Era Weekday #4\", get back to me.\n\n-----\n     Not everyone is Christian, so for non-christians it is silly to expect \n     them to refer to a year as being 2015 AD or \"In the Year of the Lord\" \n     when Jesus Christ is not their Lord.\n-----\n\nAs mentioned, our Western calendar has days, months and years named for various historical and persisting Western religions, ranging from Christianity to Norse and Roman paganism. If a non-pagan sees nothing wrong with referring to all of the days of the week using names honoring pagan gods and god-like objects, then why is Christianity any different? The fact that Christianity is still a major religious sect should have no effect whatsoever on someone who doesn't give Christianity any more credence than paganism anyhow.\n\n*/ENDQUESTIONS*\n\nAny other arguments are welcome, I'll be sure to respond. My main reason for posting this is that on Reddit/the Internet in general, I often get patronizingly told to use BCE/CE instead of BC/AD when I use the latter, so I'm certainly interested in hearing why I'm wrong here, and perhaps my mind can be swayed. I know this topic is ultimately trivial, but it speaks to the heart of so many debates and arguments within our society: RELIGION and POLITICS!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You tell the student that there have been *many* calendar systems throughout history.  You can even tell them that there are still alternate calendar systems in use today (for instance, in Japan, 2015 = Heisei 27).  Many of the old calendars were based on the births of religious figures or political leaders.  The modern Dionysian calendar, which set \"Year One\" at the birth of the religious figure Jesus, was invented in 525 and adopted by the Catholic church.  Due to the enormous influence of the church on Western civilization, it became widespread.  The BC/AD calendar also included a handy way of referring to dates in the distant past without switching to an alternate calendar scheme, which made it useful for historians.  Recently, many people choose to refer to BC/AD as BCE/CE in recognition of the fact that 1. we live in a world where only 30% of people are Christians and 2. it's probably not even the right date for the birth of Jesus.  \"Common Era\" is a much more *accurate* name for what the calendar really is: an arbitrary marking system that we use to make it easier to refer to points in time.\n\nPeople who haven't seen the BCE/CE notation before might have a moment of \"huh?,\" but it's really not that hard to understand that it means exactly the same thing as BC/AD.

We don't need to change it (and in my opinion those who are pledged to use BCE and CE with strangers are simply intellectual bullies).\n\nBut here's the problem with your argument: BCE and CE *are* historically more accurate and appropriate.  Leaving something ambiguous will always be a better thing to do than to answer something wrong.  We don't know 100% that Christ was born in the Year 0, so people who use BCE and CE are politically correct.\n\nHere's an example: let's say we're learning math and our problem is 11 * 11.  We don't really know, but we know 10 * 10, so we say it's probably 105.  When we answer, we say 105.  Saying 105 is like saying BC/AD.  Saying \"I don't know the answer because I don't know how to solve this problem yet\" is like saying BCE/CE.\n\nI think the word \"common\" was chosen because, well, there are few other words we could use and still remain secular (the word *general* comes to mind).  BCE/CE users mark Year 0 as the beginning of the common era because, well, that's how society views the split in history.  Notice how BCE/CE users don't mark 5 BC as the beginning of the Common era, even though you noted in your argument that 5 BC is more accurate to Christ's birth.  They are just copying what society has set, but using better names.\n\nTL;DR: We don't really need to change BC/AD, similar to the way that we don't need to change our numbers into base 12 or change the imperial system to the metric system.  Once something is so widespread, even if it's erroneous, it will most likely remain.

Structure is the foundation of good writing and good thinking; without it even the best idea can't be communicated effectively. (Grammar is taught in it's own dedicated class for at least a solid half a year, if not a whole year). \n\nThat's what I would start with - not even writing yet, but critical thinking. Structured thinking - because if you can't think clearly, how can you expect to write clearly? Taking a topic and breaking it down into discrete ideas. Understanding how those ideas interact to form an opinion, an argument, an emotion, a scene, etc. Learning to find and describe the purpose for each sentence in a piece of writing. \n\nThen, writing. A lot of writing. Writing on easy topics, in great numbers. Tedious, structured writing, again and again and again. An essay a week. Two essays a week! Learning to assign purpose to every sentence. Learning to communicate a concept in the form of a series of ideas, clearly, directly. \n\nThen, more complicated writing. Bending the structure. Emphasizing personal voice, looking carefully at word choice and sentence structure to create a particular feel to the writing. Persuasive writing and research papers (since they're common formats in academia). \n\nMore practically, I would preach the magical writing schedule: research, outline, rough and final. \n\n* Research: not necessarily literal academic research (although it could be), more generally a gathering of your *tools* into a single, easily accessible space. A brainstorm, a character map, even a photo of a scene or a list of points constitutes \"research.\" You want to know what you're going to be using to build your piece of writing. \n\n* Outline: This is, and I am 100% serious, the *most* important part of your writing process. This is where you identify the structure of your writing, where you get your thoughts in order, and where you can always refer back to if you get lost during the writing process. You take your research (tools) and you put them into their respective place. You identify the flow of the ideas in your writing. The outlining style can vary (I like to write out the introduction in it's entirety, and just bullet point the rest into place), but the function is the same - this is your anchor. \n\n* Rough - the messy, painful process of putting words on paper. Just do it. The more thorough your outline, the easier this is. \n\n* Final - clean up and proofread.\n\nThe great thing about this process is, the more you do it, the better you get. Eventually, your outline becomes your rough draft, and your rough draft becomes your final.

The sat doesn't really come close to answering \"Do you know how to study?\" Or \"Do you know how to recall information under pressure?\" The SAT isn't a test about studying, and that pressure is really taken off of studying efficiently by allowing people to take it until they get the score they want, so that as long as they know how to solve the problems in the end, it doesn't matter if they studied effectively along the way. The sat also doesn't touch recalling information under pressure. In fact, the emphasis is specifically not on recalling information, as evidenced by the fact that essay graders do not penalize false or made-up information, and the presence of formulas at the beginning of every math section. Finally, the sat only answer the question \"can you hold yourself accountable to a schedule?\" Very narrowly, like how it answers the first question I discussed. While it may require you to hold yourself accountable to a schedule during the test, I think anyone who has gone to college knows that sticking to a schedule during an hour-long test is a completely different beast from sticking to a month-long study schedule.\n\nThe SAT essay's relevance to academic performance is also only useful when teachers test in a very specific way: short-ish exams with an emphasis on quickly responding to long-answer questions. In my experience as a science major, this has little to do with the exams I take, and basically all the essay did was reduce my SAT score without revealing anything meaningful about my performance in school. Admittedly, there were a few core classes that tested in this way, but for most of these classes, the bulk of the grade was decided by essays written at home, in which time to organize your thoughts and put them on paper was abundant. Even for my friends in writing-intensive majors, they do not have to worry much about writing quickly -- many of their classes don't even have exams, and most of their performance is measured by term papers and research papers that they are given weeks or months to write. These take large amounts of time and thought devoted to organization and exploring ideas before even beginning to write. Unfortunately, both time and thought are in short supply when it comes to the SAT essay. \n\nIn short, although the I agree that an important aspect of the SAT is to measure future academic performance, I disagree that the essay is a useful tool for predicting a college student's performance because it does not reflect the types of work that will expected of most people in college."}, {"id": "2qzfbp", "body": "Timed essays, especially with as little time as the SAT gives, force test takers to come up with a BS answer without really thinking about it.

So maybe there's an obvious reason for there not to be such a provision that I haven't considered, but here's what I think:\n\nI know that trademarks require continued use to be demonstrated every few years in order to be maintained, but copyrights last continuously for the life of the author + 70 years regardless of whether they're being used or not. While I believe that the term should definitely be shortened, that's not really what I'm concerned with in this post.\n\nI've previously read that the percentage of works that remain profitable after multiple decades is in the low single-digits (I can't remember the exact percentage or number of years). Thus, the vast majority of works that remain under copyright aren't likely to be exploited at all for a period of many, many decades until they are finally released into the public domain (at which point they may not have nearly as much relevance, or they may not even be accessible anymore at all). I have come across this in many cases myself, in which I've found that large numbers of books are out of print and large numbers of TV shows have never been released in any purchasable format at all. In some cases, the company has even explicitly stated that the reason the shows won't be released is due to the fact that it wouldn't be profitable enough. So what's the point of the company continuing to hold the copyright?\n\nSome people might argue that one right granted by copyright is the right to control when a work is released, and thus that the copyright holder has the right not to release it. But surely in the vast majority of cases, the copyright holder would be open to the work's release...if it would be profitable. The Constitution states that the purpose of copyright is to promote the progress of the arts (or something like that), and if a work is being kept from the public solely for monetary reasons - with the motivation behind this decision being very unlikely to change in the future - isn't the copyright actually working against the progress of the arts? Obviously there is no possibility of the work \"promoting the progress of the arts\" if the public has absolutely no way to access it, but if there was a legal way to access it, then it would at least have a chance to do so. Yet current copyright law denies this.\n\nTherefore, while I do believe that other changes should be made to copyright law as well, I think that requiring a copyright holder to maintain continued use of the works for which they hold the copyrights would be a good first step. So long as the works are made available to the public sufficiently often and for a sufficient amount of time, the copyright holder would continue to hold the copyright up until the maximum term length. This still benefits the copyright holder because they will surely keep releasing any work that remains profitable sufficiently often to maintain the copyright as long as possible, but also benefits the public because books, TV shows, and other media that remain out of print or unavailable for a sufficient amount of time would become public domain, allowing legal access to them for anyone who desired (access that would likely be impossible under current copyright law).\n\nRequiring such continued use seems as though it would be especially beneficial as more media shifts to the digital realm. It seems highly likely that very large numbers of books, and presumably large amounts of other forms of media as well, will never even be converted to a digital format due to the copyright holder simply thinking it wouldn't be worth it. If continued use was required, this would either provide an additional incentive to the copyright holder to do so or allow members of the public who care about the works in question to facilitate their own digital conversions instead.\n\nI'll admit that I could foresee some problems with this, but I believe that the positive effects would definitely outweigh any negative ones. One initial problem would simply be determining how \"continued use\" should be defined, since any term specified and language used would inevitably be fairly arbitrary. For example, I don't think that making just a small number of copies available every so often or making copies only available for a short period of time every so often should count. I would suggest that the public should have the continued ability to purchase or otherwise legally obtain the works for a majority of the time within any given time period (which should probably be ~5-6 years; similar to the term for trademark law). While it might seem like a problem at first, I'm sure that it would be possible to figure out a satisfactory wording for such a provision, though it should be done in such a way that the term can't simply be extended in the way that the copyright term itself has been repeatedly extended.\n\nWhat might be the most major problem I could foresee would be the impact on the secondhand media industry. While I don't know for sure how large of a portion of the economy this makes up, or how many jobs are involved, it seems obvious that it could take a hit if people no longer needed to buy secondhand copies of media in order to access it. This wouldn't be a problem in cases where the media has never been available for purchase in the first place (as with many TV shows), but it might be in cases where the media is simply out of print. Despite this, I still believe that a continued use provision would be a good idea. While it may negatively impact secondhand media industries, I think that it would also open up opportunities for many more industries. The additional material that would be available in the public domain would allow the public to create adaptations, derivative works, and other new media inspired by it without fear of being sued for violating the copyright on a work that the copyright holder wasn't using and likely had no plans to use anyway. This seems as though it might even allow new sectors of the media industry to be created, and would surely allow it to expand at the very least. And there would surely still be some people who would want the original copies of out of print works, allowing the secondhand media industry to continue to exist in some form. However, given the continued shift to digital media and the fact that there currently is pretty much no secondhand market for digital media as far as I know, the secondhand media industry seems very likely to shrink over time regardless of any changes in copyright law, so the actual impact of a continued use provision may not be particularly large in the end after all.\n\nAdditionally, I suppose that there might be occasional cases in which works could return to profitability after long periods of being unprofitable and thus not being made available to the public (periods that would presumably be longer than those allowed by a continued use provision). However, as far as I know, cases such as these are quite rare and should not be viewed as a significant enough reason not to adopt a continued use provision.\n\nAnyway, I apologize that this is so long, but I've tried to describe my position as well as I can (though I might be able to come up with even more reasons for it if necessary) and tried to anticipate possible arguments against it as well. Again, I don't think I've ever seen anyone else suggest this as a possible solution for some of the problems with copyright law, so I'm genuinely interested to see whether anyone thinks this could be viable or not. Though shortening the current copyright terms (among other changes) would definitely be preferable, another extension might even be acceptable if absolutely necessary so long as a continued use provision was included as well. While some works wouldn't enter the public domain for an even longer period of time, many more would be likely to enter it much sooner than they otherwise would (and those that didn't would still have their availability to the public ensured), making this seem like a potentially reasonable compromise to me (if a compromise was necessary at all). If there are problems that I haven't foreseen or if I've underestimated the problems that I have foreseen, then I would definitely be open to changing my view on this (though I think it's very unlikely that my view that copyright law needs to be modified in general would change).\n\nTL;DR: Copyright law as it now stands causes most works to remain under copyright for decades without truly benefiting either the copyright holder or the public, while potentially causing works to become entirely unavailable by the time they should enter the public domain. This seems to violate the purpose of copyright as specified in the Constitution (which states that it's supposed to promote the progress of the arts) because the works are being kept away from public access for purely monetary reasons (i.e. copyright holders don't believe that making them available would be profitable) that are not very likely to change in the future. Adding a continued use provision (somewhat similar to that specified in trademark law) could provide an additional incentive for copyright holders to make works available to the public, and could allow works that continue to be out of print or entirely unavailable to enter the public domain before the maximum term would otherwise be up while allowing works that continue to be profitable to remain protected by copyright as long as possible. This would be especially beneficial as digital media continues to become more prevalent, since it would either encourage the copyright holder to digitize works that would otherwise not be likely to be digitized or allow the public to digitize these works themselves if the copyright holder still elects not to do so. While this might negatively impact secondhand media industries, it would surely benefit the public as a whole and would be almost certain to result in the expansion of other media industries. It may not even impact the secondhand media industry as much as it might seem as though it would, since the lack of a secondhand market for digital media seems likely to cause the secondhand media industry to shrink in the future regardless of any changes in copyright law. While there may be some cases in which works could return to profitability after long periods of not being profitable and thus having not been made available to the public, these cases are likely to be rare enough that they shouldn't hinder the adoption of a continued use provision. If there are other problems that I haven't foreseen, or if I've underestimated the problems that I have foreseen, then I would be open to changing my view on this.\n\nEdit: Minor sentence improvements.\n\nEdit 2: Added TL;DR.\n\nEdit 3: More minor sentence improvements."}, {"id": "cnb34xs", "body": "The biggest issue I see is that it'll just end up forcing copyright holders to create minimally valuable content just to hold ownership of the property.

Similar things have happened in other cases as well (for example, in the case of the 1994 Fantastic Four movie), but I don't believe that this would necessarily be relevant under a consideration of continued use. The work itself would have to continue being used, not just something based on it. However, I'll admit that this does technically bring up an interesting point regarding licensing rights. I'm not sure what the best way to handle them would be if continued use was required (for example, if a copyright holder sold the film rights for a work to another company and then failed to make the work available and lost the copyright before the film had actually been made), though I'd still have to be convinced that it wouldn't be possible to handle them in some way. In most cases, I don't think it would be an issue, anyway - I'm not sure why another company would be interested in buying film or other licensing rights in the first place if the actual copyright holder didn't think that the work was even worth releasing to the public at all, especially given that the unavailability of the work would lead to its entrance into the public domain, anyway (at which point the film company could still make a movie based on the work if they really wanted to - they just wouldn't have the exclusive right to do so).\n\nEdit: Minor sentence improvements.\n\nEdit 2: Now that I think about it, the licensing issue wouldn't be unique to a continued use provision. It seems as though it would still be an issue even under the current copyright system, though no one would have come across it for a long time since nothing has really left copyright for many years. Does anyone know how this would be handled? For example, how would it be handled in a case in which the life + 70 years term is finally a year or two from being over and the copyright holder sells the film rights, but the film company doesn't make the film before the term is up? I would assume that the film company would simply be accepting the risk that they might not make the film before the copyright has ended, and it seems as though this situation really wouldn't be much different from the situation I previously described as being possible under a continued use provision after all."}, {"id": "cnb34xs", "body": "The biggest issue I see is that it'll just end up forcing copyright holders to create minimally valuable content just to hold ownership of the property.

I am sure there are a lot of people out there who are eager to put him into pornography as a way of both shocking people's sensibilities (specifically because he is such a recognized symbol), and shitty warehouse owners eager to make a few bucks stamping out cheap, crappy, mouse ears.  Why on earth should be be helping those people?\n\nYes copyright's origin is providing content creators, and their families, a stream of income from the fruits of their work during their lifetimes, but surely if a piece of IP is still producing huge revenues close to a hundred years on we are dealing with something outside of that view that is also worth protecting.  \n\nI acknowledge there really is a conflict between what you are suggesting, art as a conversation that requires dynamic contribution by different voices for the benefit of all, and profiting from IP you created.  But if I wanted to actually contribute something to the public, some smart commentary I had about Mickey Mouse, I could do it in different ways.  I can make Road Runner without the road runner being Mickey Mouse.  I can make spaceballs without apropriating the star wars name.  I can make fifty shades of grey without appropriating twilight. Heck it is actually really rare for someone to take a public domain work and really do something of public merit with it.\n\nWhat public domain really does is stop us from having to figure out who owns, and how much they should be paid, every single little piece of media that is ancient.  That is a hugely useful function in this day and age but no one is out there trying to remake the vast, vast, majority of old public domain works.  \n\nWhere there are exceptions to this the new author is creating their own value as opposed to just appropriating it.  You want to make a Dracula movie, a From the Earth to the Moon remake, a Pride and Prejudice Series you had better be bringing something new and wonderful to the table or it is going to flop and you will lose a bunch of money.

While it might be great if everything would enter the public domain after only a few years, this doesn't really seem fair to copyright holders who have managed to produce works that are able to remain truly popular for a significant amount of time. While copyright is pretty much supposed to have the basic purpose that you've described, I don't see any problem with rewarding copyright holders whose works are more popular with longer terms. That's where a continued use provision would come in - copyright holders who have produced popular, profitable works would be allowed to continue holding the exclusive rights to them up until the maximum term length as long as they continue to make them available (yes, these terms should ideally be very significantly shorter than the current life-plus-70-years terms, but that's not necessarily relevant to my proposition), while copyright holders who have produced less popular works that aren't even profitable for them to make available at all would lose the copyright sooner.\n\nNow, even having said that, I do agree that many Mickey Mouse cartoons should have entered the public domain a long time ago (since the maximum copyright term should be much shorter). This would obviously benefit society more than allowing Disney to basically control their copyrights for an essentially infinite amount of time. Nevertheless, as I've previously stated, I would be open to allowing very long terms if necessary (even terms that would keep the earliest Mickey Mouse cartoons under copyright for a longer period of time) if it would mean that a continued use provision would be added to copyright law in return. I'm sure that such a provision would allow many more works to enter the public domain than it would keep out, so it seems like it would benefit both society and copyright holders enough to be a decent compromise (and could perhaps serve as a stepping stone to making other positive changes to copyright law in the future).

If either way would allow the copyright holder to retain the copyright, why not take the option that requires less effort and maintains the reputation of the work? You still haven't really addressed this.\n\nb) seems possible, I suppose, but giving the property a negative reputation simply to spite other companies still seems as though, again, it would take more effort than it would take to simply make the original work available. If the copyright holder wants to reduce the value the work could have for others, then they surely see value in it in the first place and thus it would be better to just make the work available rather than to lower its reputation (especially since making the reputation-lowering work available would still ensure that the copyright holder would retain the copyright for a few more years, anyway). I think I understand what you're suggesting, but you still haven't really addressed any reasons why producing a lower-quality work and making it available would be preferable to just making the original work available.\n\nIn the case of c), this obviously seems possible, but doesn't seem like a unique problem with regards to a continued use provision. A company could still produce a low-quality movie in order to market other products under current copyright law (and this obviously happens in many cases). I don't really see any reason why requiring continued use would make this any more likely.\n\nSo, yes, I agree that those could all be reasons that a company might produce a derivative work to avoid losing the copyright, but they only really seem to make sense if producing a derivative work would be the only way to avoid the loss. This seems as though it would make more sense in terms of retaining licensing rights than it would in terms of retaining the actual copyright itself. As I've already stated, you haven't really provided any reasons why you think a company would prefer to produce a derivative work solely for any of these purposes instead of just making the original work available, since this would also allow the retention of the copyright.\n\nI also agree that it may be somewhat tough to get the provision added to the law in the first place, but I still don't see how a copyright holder can make a truly rational argument against it. Most copyright holders are presumably motivated by profit, and a continued use provision wouldn't really take any potential for profit away. The only copyrights that the copyright holders would lose would be the ones that they didn't see as profitable in the first place, so they wouldn't actually be harmed by the loss. On the other hand, as I stated similarly in my previous reply to you, I find it extremely unlikely that lobbyists for large media companies would allow a drastic increase in the length of the copyright (though I do believe that this should really be done). This is why I have also suggested that if it is still necessary to increase the agreeability of the media companies and other copyright holders to the addition of a continued use provision, a further extension to the maximum length of copyright law could be granted at the same time (this way, they wouldn't really be on the \"losing end\" of the argument after all). It would really be preferable for this not to be necessary, but as a compromise, it seems worth it.\n\nWith regards to your suggestion of a condition based on continued investment of financial resources, I would be interested to know what you mean. Without at least a short description of this option, I'm not sure whether it would be palatable or not.\n\nAnother option that I've recently come up with could possibly be to consider a non-copyright-holder's use of a copyright that hasn't been used for some length of time (perhaps 5 years, or maybe even 10 to be especially lenient to the copyright holder) to be fair use. In this case, the copyright holder shouldn't be allowed to sue someone for utilizing their unused copyright (which seems unethical to me in the first place), but they could continuously start the length of time over at any point by meeting some minimum standard of use and availability. This probably wouldn't even necessitate a change in any law - all that it would require would be for courts to agree with such an interpretation. If the person using the unused copyrighted material without permission is simply acquiring a personal copy and has every intention to purchase the material if it ever is made available, then I could even see such an interpretation of fair use having a chance of already being acceptable in court (though it might still be controversial). In fact, I would be genuinely interested to know if this particular case could already be considered fair use - I've been unable to find a single concrete example of anyone ever being sued for making a personal copy of something that the copyright holder wasn't making available, so I don't know where the law would stand on this. Of course, even if that particular case could already be considered fair use, the interpretation of fair use would surely still need to be widened further in order to allow other technically unauthorized uses of an unused copyright, as I described above. However, I still definitely don't think that having such an interpretation of fair use would be better than requiring a continued use provision - if anything, such an interpretation would only be a temporary fix until a continued use provision could be adopted.\n\nTL;DR: All three of the cases you've described make sense as reasons why a copyright holder would rather produce a low-quality derivative work than lose a copyright, but don't really serve as reasons why the copyright holder would find this preferable to just making the original work available, since this would also prevent the loss of the copyright. (In fact, the reasons you've presented really seem more relevant to cases in which a company wants to avoid losing licensing rights than to cases in which they could lose an actual copyright they own.) While copyright holders might be seen as the \"losers\" in any situation that reduces their hold over their copyrights, I still don't really see how they would truly be harmed in any situation presented by a continued use provision. On the other hand, they obviously could argue that other changes to copyright (such as reduced term length) would harm them. If absolutely necessary in order to allow them to come out \"on top\" too, a continued use provision could be passed at the same time as an additional extension to the maximum copyright terms, though reducing the terms would still be preferable. I would be interested to know what you mean by saying that continued investment of financial resources could be required, though I've also been thinking that interpreting the use of a copyright that hasn't been used for a sufficient amount of time as fair use could possibly be another alternative to adding a continued use provision (though I definitely don't think this option would be better). Additionally, I would be interested to know if making a personal copy of copyrighted material that isn't officially available with the intention of purchasing it if it ever becomes available would already be considered fair use now (while not appearing particularly blatant, this seems like one of the most \"extreme\" cases that I could see possibly being considered fair use). This would at least slightly (though not even close to entirely) reduce the need for a continued use provision or some other type of reform to copyright law, since there would still technically be a legal way to obtain a copy. It would allow at least some potential for the promotion of progress in the arts, no matter what the purpose of making a personal copy would have actually been, as opposed to no potential if there was truly no way to obtain a copy at all. But this would really just be a temporary, partial fix until a continued use provision could be adopted.\n\nEdit: Minor sentence improvements."}, {"id": "2qz712", "body": "I've been thinking about this for a while, and I'm surprised that I don't think I've ever seen anyone else suggest it. So maybe there's an obvious reason for there not to be such a provision that I haven't considered, but here's what I think:\n\nI know that trademarks require continued use to be demonstrated every few years in order to be maintained, but copyrights last continuously for the life of the author + 70 years regardless of whether they're being used or not. While I believe that the term should definitely be shortened, that's not really what I'm concerned with in this post.\n\nI've previously read that the percentage of works that remain profitable after multiple decades is in the low single-digits (I can't remember the exact percentage or number of years). Thus, the vast majority of works that remain under copyright aren't likely to be exploited at all for a period of many, many decades until they are finally released into the public domain (at which point they may not have nearly as much relevance, or they may not even be accessible anymore at all). I have come across this in many cases myself, in which I've found that large numbers of books are out of print and large numbers of TV shows have never been released in any purchasable format at all. In some cases, the company has even explicitly stated that the reason the shows won't be released is due to the fact that it wouldn't be profitable enough. So what's the point of the company continuing to hold the copyright?\n\nSome people might argue that one right granted by copyright is the right to control when a work is released, and thus that the copyright holder has the right not to release it. But surely in the vast majority of cases, the copyright holder would be open to the work's release...if it would be profitable. The Constitution states that the purpose of copyright is to promote the progress of the arts (or something like that), and if a work is being kept from the public solely for monetary reasons - with the motivation behind this decision being very unlikely to change in the future - isn't the copyright actually working against the progress of the arts? Obviously there is no possibility of the work \"promoting the progress of the arts\" if the public has absolutely no way to access it, but if there was a legal way to access it, then it would at least have a chance to do so. Yet current copyright law denies this.\n\nTherefore, while I do believe that other changes should be made to copyright law as well, I think that requiring a copyright holder to maintain continued use of the works for which they hold the copyrights would be a good first step. So long as the works are made available to the public sufficiently often and for a sufficient amount of time, the copyright holder would continue to hold the copyright up until the maximum term length. This still benefits the copyright holder because they will surely keep releasing any work that remains profitable sufficiently often to maintain the copyright as long as possible, but also benefits the public because books, TV shows, and other media that remain out of print or unavailable for a sufficient amount of time would become public domain, allowing legal access to them for anyone who desired (access that would likely be impossible under current copyright law).\n\nRequiring such continued use seems as though it would be especially beneficial as more media shifts to the digital realm. It seems highly likely that very large numbers of books, and presumably large amounts of other forms of media as well, will never even be converted to a digital format due to the copyright holder simply thinking it wouldn't be worth it. If continued use was required, this would either provide an additional incentive to the copyright holder to do so or allow members of the public who care about the works in question to facilitate their own digital conversions instead.\n\nI'll admit that I could foresee some problems with this, but I believe that the positive effects would definitely outweigh any negative ones. One initial problem would simply be determining how \"continued use\" should be defined, since any term specified and language used would inevitably be fairly arbitrary. For example, I don't think that making just a small number of copies available every so often or making copies only available for a short period of time every so often should count. I would suggest that the public should have the continued ability to purchase or otherwise legally obtain the works for a majority of the time within any given time period (which should probably be ~5-6 years; similar to the term for trademark law). While it might seem like a problem at first, I'm sure that it would be possible to figure out a satisfactory wording for such a provision, though it should be done in such a way that the term can't simply be extended in the way that the copyright term itself has been repeatedly extended.\n\nWhat might be the most major problem I could foresee would be the impact on the secondhand media industry. While I don't know for sure how large of a portion of the economy this makes up, or how many jobs are involved, it seems obvious that it could take a hit if people no longer needed to buy secondhand copies of media in order to access it. This wouldn't be a problem in cases where the media has never been available for purchase in the first place (as with many TV shows), but it might be in cases where the media is simply out of print. Despite this, I still believe that a continued use provision would be a good idea. While it may negatively impact secondhand media industries, I think that it would also open up opportunities for many more industries. The additional material that would be available in the public domain would allow the public to create adaptations, derivative works, and other new media inspired by it without fear of being sued for violating the copyright on a work that the copyright holder wasn't using and likely had no plans to use anyway. This seems as though it might even allow new sectors of the media industry to be created, and would surely allow it to expand at the very least. And there would surely still be some people who would want the original copies of out of print works, allowing the secondhand media industry to continue to exist in some form. However, given the continued shift to digital media and the fact that there currently is pretty much no secondhand market for digital media as far as I know, the secondhand media industry seems very likely to shrink over time regardless of any changes in copyright law, so the actual impact of a continued use provision may not be particularly large in the end after all.\n\nAdditionally, I suppose that there might be occasional cases in which works could return to profitability after long periods of being unprofitable and thus not being made available to the public (periods that would presumably be longer than those allowed by a continued use provision). However, as far as I know, cases such as these are quite rare and should not be viewed as a significant enough reason not to adopt a continued use provision.\n\nAnyway, I apologize that this is so long, but I've tried to describe my position as well as I can (though I might be able to come up with even more reasons for it if necessary) and tried to anticipate possible arguments against it as well. Again, I don't think I've ever seen anyone else suggest this as a possible solution for some of the problems with copyright law, so I'm genuinely interested to see whether anyone thinks this could be viable or not. Though shortening the current copyright terms (among other changes) would definitely be preferable, another extension might even be acceptable if absolutely necessary so long as a continued use provision was included as well. While some works wouldn't enter the public domain for an even longer period of time, many more would be likely to enter it much sooner than they otherwise would (and those that didn't would still have their availability to the public ensured), making this seem like a potentially reasonable compromise to me (if a compromise was necessary at all). If there are problems that I haven't foreseen or if I've underestimated the problems that I have foreseen, then I would definitely be open to changing my view on this (though I think it's very unlikely that my view that copyright law needs to be modified in general would change).\n\nTL;DR: Copyright law as it now stands causes most works to remain under copyright for decades without truly benefiting either the copyright holder or the public, while potentially causing works to become entirely unavailable by the time they should enter the public domain. This seems to violate the purpose of copyright as specified in the Constitution (which states that it's supposed to promote the progress of the arts) because the works are being kept away from public access for purely monetary reasons (i.e. copyright holders don't believe that making them available would be profitable) that are not very likely to change in the future. Adding a continued use provision (somewhat similar to that specified in trademark law) could provide an additional incentive for copyright holders to make works available to the public, and could allow works that continue to be out of print or entirely unavailable to enter the public domain before the maximum term would otherwise be up while allowing works that continue to be profitable to remain protected by copyright as long as possible. This would be especially beneficial as digital media continues to become more prevalent, since it would either encourage the copyright holder to digitize works that would otherwise not be likely to be digitized or allow the public to digitize these works themselves if the copyright holder still elects not to do so. While this might negatively impact secondhand media industries, it would surely benefit the public as a whole and would be almost certain to result in the expansion of other media industries. It may not even impact the secondhand media industry as much as it might seem as though it would, since the lack of a secondhand market for digital media seems likely to cause the secondhand media industry to shrink in the future regardless of any changes in copyright law. While there may be some cases in which works could return to profitability after long periods of not being profitable and thus having not been made available to the public, these cases are likely to be rare enough that they shouldn't hinder the adoption of a continued use provision. If there are other problems that I haven't foreseen, or if I've underestimated the problems that I have foreseen, then I would be open to changing my view on this.\n\nEdit: Minor sentence improvements.\n\nEdit 2: Added TL;DR.\n\nEdit 3: More minor sentence improvements."}, {"id": "cnaxbzz", "body": "Simple workaround: If you are trying to use Copyright to purposefully suppress a work that you own, you can make it 'available' for the low, low price of $1 Trillion.

It would effectively replace the fee with the simple requirement that the copyrighted work be made available in some form.

While this might negatively impact secondhand media industries, it would surely benefit the public as a whole and would be almost certain to result in the expansion of other media industries.

Perhaps certain individual works might not be considered to provide a \"significant benefit\" to society (though I believe they would still provide at least some benefit), but all of the works that would enter the public domain due to a continued use clause as a whole would surely be enough to constitute a very significant benefit. Any individual work might not be popular enough for the copyright holder to believe it to be profitable to make it available, but in the public domain, it could have the potential to provide inspiration to at least a niche group of people, thus promoting the \"progress of the arts\" in this way. So while the work might be seen as having little monetary value (and thus little value in many copyright holders' eyes), it could still have cultural value if it was made available. If a copyright holder truly believes a work to have such little monetary value that it isn't worth it for them to personally make it available to the public, how is releasing the copyright so that it can still have cultural value harming the copyright holder in any way? If the copyright isn't being used and is likely to never be used again, the copyright holder isn't really gaining anything from it at all. So why would it be preferable to wait decades before it enters the public domain rather than allowing it to enter the public domain immediately? After all, it would still enter the public domain either way - a continued use provision would just make it happen much sooner, giving it the potential to further the progress of the arts for decades longer than it would have otherwise. The only potential reason to hold onto an unused copyright that I can see would be so that the copyright holder could sue anyone who is perceived to have violated it, which seems rather unethical to me if they aren't using it in the first place and surely works counter to copyright's purpose of promoting the progress of the arts. And as I stated in one of my arguments, the fact that we're moving farther into \"the digital age\" seems like a reason to support a continued use provision, not a reason to be against one. Perhaps keeping content available in digital form might be virtually free (I don't know for sure whether this is true or not), but making it available in the first place might not be, and thus many currently out of print or unavailable works might not ever be made available in digital form if copyright law remains in its current state. With regards to content that is already available digitally, all that the copyright holder would have to do to keep the copyright would be to maintain its availability (which doesn't always happen just because something is in digital form - I know of several cases in which certain digital media has already become unavailable to purchase in any way), and I don't see any reason why digital media should be excepted from this. I also don't really understand your final sentence - with a continued use provision, people would still have to pay for copyrighted content. The difference would be that content that a copyright holder isn't even giving people the option to pay for would lose its copyright after a few years, while content that remains available to purchase would still have its copyright last as long as the copyright term would allow.\n\nTL;DR: If a copyrighted work is still going to enter the public domain eventually, what's the point of letting a copyright holder retain it for decades without ever using it or having any intention of using it? If it entered the public domain much more quickly due to not being under continued use, then it would have much more of a potential to benefit the public (however small the benefit might actually be) without really harming the copyright holder in any significant way. If the copyright holder truly believes that they would be harmed by losing the copyright, then wouldn't such a belief go hand in hand with believing that it would be profitable to make it available (and thus they could simply do so in order to retain it)? Even if an individual work wouldn't necessarily provide a significant benefit to the public, the cumulative effect of all of the works entering the public domain would surely be significant.\n\nEdit: Added TL;DR and made minor sentence improvements."}, {"id": "2qz712", "body": "I've been thinking about this for a while, and I'm surprised that I don't think I've ever seen anyone else suggest it. So maybe there's an obvious reason for there not to be such a provision that I haven't considered, but here's what I think:\n\nI know that trademarks require continued use to be demonstrated every few years in order to be maintained, but copyrights last continuously for the life of the author + 70 years regardless of whether they're being used or not. While I believe that the term should definitely be shortened, that's not really what I'm concerned with in this post.\n\nI've previously read that the percentage of works that remain profitable after multiple decades is in the low single-digits (I can't remember the exact percentage or number of years). Thus, the vast majority of works that remain under copyright aren't likely to be exploited at all for a period of many, many decades until they are finally released into the public domain (at which point they may not have nearly as much relevance, or they may not even be accessible anymore at all). I have come across this in many cases myself, in which I've found that large numbers of books are out of print and large numbers of TV shows have never been released in any purchasable format at all. In some cases, the company has even explicitly stated that the reason the shows won't be released is due to the fact that it wouldn't be profitable enough. So what's the point of the company continuing to hold the copyright?\n\nSome people might argue that one right granted by copyright is the right to control when a work is released, and thus that the copyright holder has the right not to release it. But surely in the vast majority of cases, the copyright holder would be open to the work's release...if it would be profitable. The Constitution states that the purpose of copyright is to promote the progress of the arts (or something like that), and if a work is being kept from the public solely for monetary reasons - with the motivation behind this decision being very unlikely to change in the future - isn't the copyright actually working against the progress of the arts? Obviously there is no possibility of the work \"promoting the progress of the arts\" if the public has absolutely no way to access it, but if there was a legal way to access it, then it would at least have a chance to do so. Yet current copyright law denies this.\n\nTherefore, while I do believe that other changes should be made to copyright law as well, I think that requiring a copyright holder to maintain continued use of the works for which they hold the copyrights would be a good first step. So long as the works are made available to the public sufficiently often and for a sufficient amount of time, the copyright holder would continue to hold the copyright up until the maximum term length. This still benefits the copyright holder because they will surely keep releasing any work that remains profitable sufficiently often to maintain the copyright as long as possible, but also benefits the public because books, TV shows, and other media that remain out of print or unavailable for a sufficient amount of time would become public domain, allowing legal access to them for anyone who desired (access that would likely be impossible under current copyright law).\n\nRequiring such continued use seems as though it would be especially beneficial as more media shifts to the digital realm. It seems highly likely that very large numbers of books, and presumably large amounts of other forms of media as well, will never even be converted to a digital format due to the copyright holder simply thinking it wouldn't be worth it. If continued use was required, this would either provide an additional incentive to the copyright holder to do so or allow members of the public who care about the works in question to facilitate their own digital conversions instead.\n\nI'll admit that I could foresee some problems with this, but I believe that the positive effects would definitely outweigh any negative ones. One initial problem would simply be determining how \"continued use\" should be defined, since any term specified and language used would inevitably be fairly arbitrary. For example, I don't think that making just a small number of copies available every so often or making copies only available for a short period of time every so often should count. I would suggest that the public should have the continued ability to purchase or otherwise legally obtain the works for a majority of the time within any given time period (which should probably be ~5-6 years; similar to the term for trademark law). While it might seem like a problem at first, I'm sure that it would be possible to figure out a satisfactory wording for such a provision, though it should be done in such a way that the term can't simply be extended in the way that the copyright term itself has been repeatedly extended.\n\nWhat might be the most major problem I could foresee would be the impact on the secondhand media industry. While I don't know for sure how large of a portion of the economy this makes up, or how many jobs are involved, it seems obvious that it could take a hit if people no longer needed to buy secondhand copies of media in order to access it. This wouldn't be a problem in cases where the media has never been available for purchase in the first place (as with many TV shows), but it might be in cases where the media is simply out of print. Despite this, I still believe that a continued use provision would be a good idea. While it may negatively impact secondhand media industries, I think that it would also open up opportunities for many more industries. The additional material that would be available in the public domain would allow the public to create adaptations, derivative works, and other new media inspired by it without fear of being sued for violating the copyright on a work that the copyright holder wasn't using and likely had no plans to use anyway. This seems as though it might even allow new sectors of the media industry to be created, and would surely allow it to expand at the very least. And there would surely still be some people who would want the original copies of out of print works, allowing the secondhand media industry to continue to exist in some form. However, given the continued shift to digital media and the fact that there currently is pretty much no secondhand market for digital media as far as I know, the secondhand media industry seems very likely to shrink over time regardless of any changes in copyright law, so the actual impact of a continued use provision may not be particularly large in the end after all.\n\nAdditionally, I suppose that there might be occasional cases in which works could return to profitability after long periods of being unprofitable and thus not being made available to the public (periods that would presumably be longer than those allowed by a continued use provision). However, as far as I know, cases such as these are quite rare and should not be viewed as a significant enough reason not to adopt a continued use provision.\n\nAnyway, I apologize that this is so long, but I've tried to describe my position as well as I can (though I might be able to come up with even more reasons for it if necessary) and tried to anticipate possible arguments against it as well. Again, I don't think I've ever seen anyone else suggest this as a possible solution for some of the problems with copyright law, so I'm genuinely interested to see whether anyone thinks this could be viable or not. Though shortening the current copyright terms (among other changes) would definitely be preferable, another extension might even be acceptable if absolutely necessary so long as a continued use provision was included as well. While some works wouldn't enter the public domain for an even longer period of time, many more would be likely to enter it much sooner than they otherwise would (and those that didn't would still have their availability to the public ensured), making this seem like a potentially reasonable compromise to me (if a compromise was necessary at all). If there are problems that I haven't foreseen or if I've underestimated the problems that I have foreseen, then I would definitely be open to changing my view on this (though I think it's very unlikely that my view that copyright law needs to be modified in general would change).\n\nTL;DR: Copyright law as it now stands causes most works to remain under copyright for decades without truly benefiting either the copyright holder or the public, while potentially causing works to become entirely unavailable by the time they should enter the public domain.

"}, {"id": "cnbugbo", "body": "Honestly, I pretty much agree with almost everything that you've said here to at least some degree (though not entirely). I think the only thing that I don't agree with at all is the part in which you seem to condone piracy in certain cases, since I don't think that piracy should be acceptable in any situation. I really don't want to get into an argument about that, though. Nevertheless, I would be interested in knowing whether using the copyrights of the \"abandonware games and indie movies\" that you refer to (or any other unavailable works) without explicit permission could actually be considered fair use, especially if the use of the copyright is simply in order to produce a personal copy and especially if the person using the copy fully intends to purchase the game, movie, etc. if it ever is made officially available. I've expressed my interest in this in a reply to someone else as well, simply due to the fact that it seems like the most \"extreme\" case that I could see possibly being allowed under fair use and due to the fact that it would technically allow a legal copy to be obtained under at least some circumstances. The fact that the work isn't available would mean that there are absolutely no monetary damages at all, and if the person intended to buy the work if it was ever made available, then there wouldn't even be theoretical monetary damages. So long as it was only a personal copy and this person didn't personally make it available to anyone else, there wouldn't be any other potential for damage and it might have at least some possibility of inspiring this person in some way. However, the limited scope of such a case would mean that even if it could be considered to be fair use, the copyright would still prevent the work from being used in any other way, so its benefit to society would still be extremely limited. Therefore, even if this can be considered to be fair use (though I have no idea whether anyone here is actually qualified to try to determine this, I would be interested in whatever input I could get on it since I can't seem to find any cases in which anyone has ever been sued for making a personal copy of something that isn't officially available, and thus I don't know for sure where the law regarding fair use would stand on such a case), it definitely wouldn't negate the need for a continued use provision or some other major change to copyright law.\n\nAgain, other than in the case of your section relating to piracy, I think that I mostly agree with you. It does seem entirely possible that it could harm society more if it doesn't have access to the more popular works than if it doesn't have access to the myriad other works. I also think that I like the view you've expressed in your last paragraph. It seems as though it could be good for copyright to work similarly to the way you seem to be suggesting here, but I still think it would be a good idea to give a little more balance to the copyright holder's side of the debate than your suggestion would allow. I still think that a copyright holder who produces something especially popular should be rewarded, whether with longer terms (though still not ridiculously long) or with some other type of reward (I'm not sure what this would be). With everything that I've seen about how copyright is obviously far too skewed against the public and in favor of the copyright holder as it currently stands, I've basically just become too jaded to believe that copyright could truly be reformed in any way even remotely as drastic as that which you've suggested. I still think that a continued use provision would be more likely to pass than pretty much any other solution (even it would only be a partial solution that wouldn't allow more popular works to enter the public domain any sooner and which might require a compromise of allowing these works to stay out of the public domain for an even longer period of time), so it still seems like the best solution under the current circumstances. Perhaps in the future, society might change enough that a solution that would benefit the public more (but that would still have sufficient balance with the copyright holder's rights, since I do think that they are important as well) could be enacted, too.\n\nTL;DR: I agree with you for the most part, though I definitely don't agree with the section in which you seem to condone piracy (I don't think piracy should be allowed in any case, though I don't want to get into an argument about that here). I would be interested in knowing whether obtaining a personal copy of something that isn't officially available could be considered fair use, however, especially if the person obtaining the copy fully intends to purchase the work if it ever does become officially available. If this actually is considered legal, then that seems like it could be a small step in the right direction, though it definitely wouldn't have even close to the scope that really seems necessary in order to fix copyright law. While copyright may be better if it worked similarly to the way that you've described (with some minor changes to give a little more balance toward the copyright holder, since your view seems almost too skewed toward the public - which is obviously the opposite problem that current copyright law has), I just don't see that kind of reform happening anytime soon. For now, the addition of a continued use provision seems like the most likely reform to even have a chance of getting passed, and hopefully the state of society can change enough in the future that further reform can eventually be passed as well.\n\nEdit: Added TL;DR and made minor sentence improvements."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2qz1fp", "body": "**TL;DR: Planes 2 likely made 24 times is production cost back in worldwide box office, blu-ray + dvd and merchandising.

I also eliminate films costing minimal amounts of money to produce (e.g., a youtube video or independent film not in wide release).\n\nAs a target, the highest grossing film worldwide was Transformers: Age of Extinction, which [grossed] (http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Transformers-Age-of-Extinction#tab=summary) approximately 1.137 billion in its initial worldwide release and domestic US DVD and Blu-ray sales.  Additionally, lets assume that the film grosses another 87 million in worldwide secondary sales, and around 2 billion in merchandising in the next few years. These figures aren't public, but are based on estimates from the original trilogy published by [Variety] (http://variety.com/2014/film/news/transformers-the-anatomy-of-a-cross-platform-money-maker-1201245881/). Transformers [cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=transformers4.htm) $210 million to make. So, **Transformer's 4's revenue:production cost ratio is around 15.2** (3.2b:210m).\n\nTo beat this figure, Planes: Fire and Rescue would have to have a cumulative revenue more than $760 million (15.2 x [its production cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) of $50 million).\n\nWe know that its [worldwide box office] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) was $147 million. It [made] (http://www.the-numbers.com/weekly-video-sales-chart) 22 million in domestic US blu-ray and dvd sales. Additionally, using a traditional international dvd/blu-ray sales multipler, we can estimate roughly 35 million of international sales.

I would argue that this film will do so easily. Data shows that the Cars series (averaged) [http://www.cnbc.com/id/43525949]. 2 billion per year. The original Cars film made $10 billion in merchandising in 5 years (see previous cite). This $2 billion estimate was also made before Disney expanded its theme parks to include Cars-specific attractions. It is unclear if the Cars/Planes series is still generating $2/yr, and $10 billion/film. However, the merchandising channels have been plowed by former films, and Disney is primed to take advantage of the release of Planes films. So, it would not be unrealistic to think that Planes 2 would generate at least 10% of the merchandising revenue generated by Cars. If Planes 2 generates a mere 10% of the merchandising revenue that Cars 1 generated, it would generate **1.2 billion** in total box office, dvd + bluray, and merchandising. **This gives it a 24-times revenue:production cost ratio, about 1.6 times Transformers 4's ratio of 15.**\n\nTherefore, Planes 2 is likely the most financially successful film of the year.

Whether they possess a defunction or not, it did not force them in any considerable way to stalk, apprehend, sometimes harrass or torture, and kill another human being in a deliberate and calculated manner with thought to conceal their activity and expectation to continue murdering people.        \nIf someone like that is not culpable of their own actions our entire Criminal Justice system is defunct because no one is responsible for their actions. Why hold a thief responsible, his own disfunction drove him to steal? Murder your wife, not your fault blame your brain.     \nBut the criminal justice system doesn't presecute neurological or psychological abnormalities. They prosecute people who commit crimes.      \nI'm open to other forms of murder possibly being receptive to rehabilitation, spree murderers and rage murderers and other crimes of passion or momentary madness, just not serial murderers.    "}, {"id": "cnbeco6", "body": "&gt; legal system ultimately dictates whether a perpetrator is considered able to be rehabilitated.\n\nWell I think the whole point of this kind of CMV is that just because the law and the system is that way now doesn't mean it's necessarily right\n\nAlso you've misunderstood what I said about OCD. While immediate changes to the ritual do cause distress, the rituals change and develop over time. For example a sufferer who obsessively washes their hands, may slowly change and instead obsessively count or check. It seems that similar development could happen to an impulsive killer. Change and differences don't necessarily disprove compulsion. \n\n&gt; Whether they possess a defunction or not, it did not force them in any considerable way to stalk, apprehend, sometimes harrass or torture, and kill another human being in a deliberate and calculated manner with thought to conceal their activity and expectation to continue murdering people.\n\nYou seem to not be understanding my point. The kind of people we are talking about do *know* it's wrong, because people have told them - but they have no inner morality or understanding of what that means. Sort of like if I told you it was wrong to wear pink because the might God Thumthum will send you to hell and we'll all sure make your life miserable if you do wear pink - but you don't believe in Thumthum. So you know it's 'wrong' but the reason for it's 'wrongness' doesn't make any sense to you. You might still try to avoid it because you don't want us to make you miserable, but at your core it just doesn't seem like that big a deal. It's of course more abstract than this, because people can't really explain things like empathy and wrongness at all - so these people are told somethings wrong (like wearing pink) but never given a reason why, and can't at the most basic biological level understand it.\n\nI phrased myself slightly wrong, these people would rather not go to jail - but ultimately it's never a big enough deterrence to stop them as they tend to also have issues with this kind of cognitive decision making (immediate gratification of murder vs long term punishment of jail). Most of us would immediately say that the punishment is a good deterrent and we would avoid doing things that would send us a jail, but the dysfunction in the executive function doesn't allow for that in these people. Instead they would rather do the thing and then try not to get caught. So there are attempts at hiding - but normal people wouldn't do it in the first place.\n\nAnd my point was that I don't know how it should work in the legal system and if it suggests that these people are actually so beyond rehabilitation that if they're diagnosed with this that all pretence of ever leaving jail/facility should just immediately be dropped whether they tried to kill someone, succeeded or killed 10 people. I don't know what consequences it should have. Do we believe people are a product of their biology and thus nothing is ever anyone's fault because it was all predetermined by genes and subsequent reactions to stimuli? Or do we believe that people are somehow 'more' than their biology and should be able to overcome these shortcomings? I don't know. For me it seems perfectly reasonable at the moment to punish people for doing bad things and to hold them accountable, but equally if someone I loved had a brain tumour that effected their emotions and they yelled at me, I'd blame the tumour not the person - which seems hypocritical.\n"}, {"id": "cnav7tf", "body": "No, not if you had read the whole thing.

Many of these rules have an underlying meaning behind them and sometimes make sentences less ambiguous. However, I believe that the negatives outweigh the positives by a large margin.\n\n* People understand anyway \u2013 It doesn't matter if I say \u2018Who\u2019 or \u2018Whom\u2019; people will always understand. (Which, after all, is the purpose of language)\n* People correcting people (aka grammar nazis)\u2013 If someone uses one of the rules incorrectly, it\u2019s common to see someone else correct the person talking, despite the fact that they understood what he/she was trying to say perfectly well. This disrupts the conversation and wastes time that could have been spent elsewhere. \n* It feels natural \u2013 When it comes to using these grammar rules in conversation, we almost always want to say it the incorrect way. (unless you have been trained in grammar from a very young age) This usually results in a slight pause mid-conversation when we decide how to phrase a certain sentence. We could fix this by making it acceptable to break certain grammar rules when talking casually. \n* Interrupts the flow of the conversation \u2013 This is best explained in an example.  I say \u201cShe admired my^1 running down the street\u201d in a conversation with my friends. In a split second, my friends register the fact that I didn't use the word \u2018me\u2019, realize that it is grammatically correct, understand what I\u2019m trying to convey and go back to the conversation. This could\u2019ve been avoided if I had used the word \u2018me\u2019 instead of \u2018my\u2019 despite the fact that using \u2018my\u2019 is correct in this situation.    \n\nIt should be noted that I am not actually in favor of completely throwing out these rules. I just think that we shouldn't be required to use them in casual conversation. We would still use these rules in formal settings, in legal documents and would still be taught in schools. CMV\n\n\n^1 It is technically correct to use \u2018my\u2019 or \u2018me\u2019 in this sentence.

And they'd only do that if they had a reason to do so\n\nIn a casual conversation, there's generally no reason to agree on e.g. at, in or on the weekend; for a submission on an academic paper or a legal document, it might well make a big difference to your credibility (or even the precise legal meaning) so you need to make damn sure you use the correct one.

Basically your argument, just from a different perspective."}, {"id": "2qy7a9", "body": "This has been lurking in the back of my mind ever since listening to [Word Crimes]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv0H-vPoDc).\n\nThe English language has many [pesky grammar rules]( http://www.jpetrie.net/grammar/#past-perfect) that don\u2019t come naturally to many people. Many of these rules have an underlying meaning behind them and sometimes make sentences less ambiguous. However, I believe that the negatives outweigh the positives by a large margin.\n\n* People understand anyway \u2013 It doesn't matter if I say \u2018Who\u2019 or \u2018Whom\u2019; people will always understand. (Which, after all, is the purpose of language)\n* People correcting people (aka grammar nazis)\u2013 If someone uses one of the rules incorrectly, it\u2019s common to see someone else correct the person talking, despite the fact that they understood what he/she was trying to say perfectly well. This disrupts the conversation and wastes time that could have been spent elsewhere. \n* It feels natural \u2013 When it comes to using these grammar rules in conversation, we almost always want to say it the incorrect way. (unless you have been trained in grammar from a very young age) This usually results in a slight pause mid-conversation when we decide how to phrase a certain sentence. We could fix this by making it acceptable to break certain grammar rules when talking casually. \n* Interrupts the flow of the conversation \u2013 This is best explained in an example.  I say \u201cShe admired my^1 running down the street\u201d in a conversation with my friends. In a split second, my friends register the fact that I didn't use the word \u2018me\u2019, realize that it is grammatically correct, understand what I\u2019m trying to convey and go back to the conversation. This could\u2019ve been avoided if I had used the word \u2018me\u2019 instead of \u2018my\u2019 despite the fact that using \u2018my\u2019 is correct in this situation.    \n\nIt should be noted that I am not actually in favor of completely throwing out these rules. I just think that we shouldn't be required to use them in casual conversation. We would still use these rules in formal settings, in legal documents and would still be taught in schools. CMV\n\n\n^1 It is technically correct to use \u2018my\u2019 or \u2018me\u2019 in this sentence. However, they mean two different things: Using \u2018my\u2019 means that she admired my running (this is what I\u2019m trying to convey in the sentence). On the other hand, using \u2018me\u2019 means that she admired me (while I also happen to be running down the street). This rule adds clarity to my sentence.\n\nEdit: formatting\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In fact, at some point, they become the more dominant than the market dynamics themselves.  \n\nEvery market has infinite frictions.\n\nThere is no way to model infinite frictions.\n\nTherefore the market model does not adequately describe the behavior of poor people.\n\nTherefore to describe how income distribution affects the economy, you have to abandon the market.\n\nEven though there are ways to model *some* frictions, the most basic macro models treat the economy as a set of efficient markets.\n\nSomething like game theory might not have the same inherent bias, because it wouldn't have the same starting point as models using markets, so it wouldn't necessarily be a classist bias.\n\nOf course there's the argument \"but markets aren't the only part of the field.\"  I'm not trying to get into a semantic argument about the definition of \"field.\"  And lets be real, the concept of a market is pretty much what makes economics what it is. \n\n*********\n\nYou can read all this so the comments make sense, but everything below has been pretty much hashed out.\n\nEvery mathematical model requires basic assumptions, and the conclusions drawn from it will be inescapably colored by those assumptions.\n\nIn order to say that 1 apple plus another apple is 2 apples, you have to ignore time (eventually it's 0 apples) and space and all kinds of other things. Also, there are implicit definitions (\"plus\" means putting them next to each other or in the same container)\n\nIn economics, there seem to be base assumptions that make the math easier, but aren't strictly true.  You end up with conclusions that are false.  Of course for glaring inconsistencies, the models eventually get adjusted, but there's always a lag and a cost involved in refining the models, which makes it less likely to occur.  In the meantime, people latch onto those conclusions and use them for their own agenda.\n\nIn physics, there's the ideal gas law, etc.  These tend to hold pretty accurate and be pretty precise except at the very extremes.  In economics, the \"idealized laws\" often bear very little resemblance to reality (perfect labor market?  psht).  And the precise way in which they err almost always ignores the effects on poor people, just like treating the earth as flat will tend to cause you to err on the side of overestimating distances.  Rich people tend to behave much more like the idealized laws, and so when the models get close enough to base policy off of, they tend to err in their favor.\n\nFor instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.  However, this ignores the utility in preserving certain industries nationally, as well as incubation of industries to create a comparative advantage where one didn't exist before.  Of course you can patch together something that explains this, but the math is harder, and you would never actually predict it based off of the initial model.  \n\nBy presuming that people make the best economic decisions when information is evenly distributed, there is an implicit corollary that people not making the best economic decisions have less information. \n\nSo then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. While not accepted and clearly wrong, it is a valid conclusion to draw from the above assumptions.  So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\n\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I'm saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \n\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \n\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.  Not that they're consciously making up things to justify their relative wealth, but they lack information about real people's decision-making processes, and thus will tend to err one way versus the other.  Even if an economist disagrees with some of this, they will have to take classes where they are taught what has been filtered through this system. They will be more competitive for grants and fellowships if they work within the established frameworks.\n\nAlternative models would just start with different assumptions, and then you could go through the same process of continuously modifying the model until it can explain something like supply and demand.  \n\n\nEdit 1: it's a bit irrelevant to the discussion, but this video is what I'm talking about with entropy: http://youtu.be/e91D5UAz-f4?t=53m53s\n\nEdit 2: clarifications\n\nEdit 3: Removed distracting side-points and examples.\n\nEdit 4: Rephrased argument\n\n_________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That's just untrue. While simpler modeling is easier to do in both fields, they're taken less seriously.\n\n&gt;I agree, it has an effect. Sometimes it's the primary effect. But, when you have to correct the math for every little cost that comes up, you're never going to be able to take it all into account.\n\nThe consequence of economic modeling is that some variables will inevitably be left out. They cannot all be considered. That is impossible to do. That is why economists try to capture as much of them as possible. You won't get a 100% accurate replication of the real world. That is, again, impossible.

In fact, at some point, they become the more dominant than the market dynamics themselves.  \n\nEvery market has infinite frictions.\n\nThere is no way to model infinite frictions.\n\nTherefore the market model does not adequately describe the behavior of poor people.\n\nTherefore to describe how income distribution affects the economy, you have to abandon the market.\n\nEven though there are ways to model *some* frictions, the most basic macro models treat the economy as a set of efficient markets.\n\nSomething like game theory might not have the same inherent bias, because it wouldn't have the same starting point as models using markets, so it wouldn't necessarily be a classist bias.\n\nOf course there's the argument \"but markets aren't the only part of the field.\"  I'm not trying to get into a semantic argument about the definition of \"field.\"  And lets be real, the concept of a market is pretty much what makes economics what it is. \n\n*********\n\nYou can read all this so the comments make sense, but everything below has been pretty much hashed out.\n\nEvery mathematical model requires basic assumptions, and the conclusions drawn from it will be inescapably colored by those assumptions.\n\nIn order to say that 1 apple plus another apple is 2 apples, you have to ignore time (eventually it's 0 apples) and space and all kinds of other things. Also, there are implicit definitions (\"plus\" means putting them next to each other or in the same container)\n\nIn economics, there seem to be base assumptions that make the math easier, but aren't strictly true.  You end up with conclusions that are false.  Of course for glaring inconsistencies, the models eventually get adjusted, but there's always a lag and a cost involved in refining the models, which makes it less likely to occur.  In the meantime, people latch onto those conclusions and use them for their own agenda.\n\nIn physics, there's the ideal gas law, etc.  These tend to hold pretty accurate and be pretty precise except at the very extremes.  In economics, the \"idealized laws\" often bear very little resemblance to reality (perfect labor market?  psht).  And the precise way in which they err almost always ignores the effects on poor people, just like treating the earth as flat will tend to cause you to err on the side of overestimating distances.  Rich people tend to behave much more like the idealized laws, and so when the models get close enough to base policy off of, they tend to err in their favor.\n\nFor instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.  However, this ignores the utility in preserving certain industries nationally, as well as incubation of industries to create a comparative advantage where one didn't exist before.  Of course you can patch together something that explains this, but the math is harder, and you would never actually predict it based off of the initial model.  \n\nBy presuming that people make the best economic decisions when information is evenly distributed, there is an implicit corollary that people not making the best economic decisions have less information. \n\nSo then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. While not accepted and clearly wrong, it is a valid conclusion to draw from the above assumptions.  So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\n\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I'm saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \n\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \n\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.  Not that they're consciously making up things to justify their relative wealth, but they lack information about real people's decision-making processes, and thus will tend to err one way versus the other.  Even if an economist disagrees with some of this, they will have to take classes where they are taught what has been filtered through this system. They will be more competitive for grants and fellowships if they work within the established frameworks.\n\nAlternative models would just start with different assumptions, and then you could go through the same process of continuously modifying the model until it can explain something like supply and demand.  \n\n\nEdit 1: it's a bit irrelevant to the discussion, but this video is what I'm talking about with entropy: http://youtu.be/e91D5UAz-f4?t=53m53s\n\nEdit 2: clarifications\n\nEdit 3: Removed distracting side-points and examples.\n\nEdit 4: Rephrased argument\n\n_________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Of course there are models that do take it into account eventually, but the most readily accessible mathematics is biased against poor people.

"}, {"id": "2qy3qo", "body": "This is a much clearer way to say what I was trying to say:\n\nMarket frictions affect poor people more.  In fact, at some point, they become the more dominant than the market dynamics themselves.  \n\nEvery market has infinite frictions.\n\nThere is no way to model infinite frictions.\n\nTherefore the market model does not adequately describe the behavior of poor people.\n\nTherefore to describe how income distribution affects the economy, you have to abandon the market.\n\nEven though there are ways to model *some* frictions, the most basic macro models treat the economy as a set of efficient markets.\n\nSomething like game theory might not have the same inherent bias, because it wouldn't have the same starting point as models using markets, so it wouldn't necessarily be a classist bias.\n\nOf course there's the argument \"but markets aren't the only part of the field.\"  I'm not trying to get into a semantic argument about the definition of \"field.\"  And lets be real, the concept of a market is pretty much what makes economics what it is. \n\n*********\n\nYou can read all this so the comments make sense, but everything below has been pretty much hashed out.\n\nEvery mathematical model requires basic assumptions, and the conclusions drawn from it will be inescapably colored by those assumptions.\n\nIn order to say that 1 apple plus another apple is 2 apples, you have to ignore time (eventually it's 0 apples) and space and all kinds of other things. Also, there are implicit definitions (\"plus\" means putting them next to each other or in the same container)\n\nIn economics, there seem to be base assumptions that make the math easier, but aren't strictly true.  You end up with conclusions that are false.  Of course for glaring inconsistencies, the models eventually get adjusted, but there's always a lag and a cost involved in refining the models, which makes it less likely to occur.  In the meantime, people latch onto those conclusions and use them for their own agenda.\n\nIn physics, there's the ideal gas law, etc.  These tend to hold pretty accurate and be pretty precise except at the very extremes.  In economics, the \"idealized laws\" often bear very little resemblance to reality (perfect labor market?  psht).  And the precise way in which they err almost always ignores the effects on poor people, just like treating the earth as flat will tend to cause you to err on the side of overestimating distances.  Rich people tend to behave much more like the idealized laws, and so when the models get close enough to base policy off of, they tend to err in their favor.\n\nFor instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.  However, this ignores the utility in preserving certain industries nationally, as well as incubation of industries to create a comparative advantage where one didn't exist before.  Of course you can patch together something that explains this, but the math is harder, and you would never actually predict it based off of the initial model.  \n\nBy presuming that people make the best economic decisions when information is evenly distributed, there is an implicit corollary that people not making the best economic decisions have less information. \n\nSo then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. While not accepted and clearly wrong, it is a valid conclusion to draw from the above assumptions.  So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\n\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I'm saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \n\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \n\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.  Not that they're consciously making up things to justify their relative wealth, but they lack information about real people's decision-making processes, and thus will tend to err one way versus the other.  Even if an economist disagrees with some of this, they will have to take classes where they are taught what has been filtered through this system. They will be more competitive for grants and fellowships if they work within the established frameworks.\n\nAlternative models would just start with different assumptions, and then you could go through the same process of continuously modifying the model until it can explain something like supply and demand.  \n\n\nEdit 1: it's a bit irrelevant to the discussion, but this video is what I'm talking about with entropy: http://youtu.be/e91D5UAz-f4?t=53m53s\n\nEdit 2: clarifications\n\nEdit 3: Removed distracting side-points and examples.\n\nEdit 4: Rephrased argument\n\n_________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Because of that, when it is important, the field of aerodynamics zooms in with a model that takes very different fundamental assumptions.\n\nWhich is exactly what happens in economics.  I assume fluid dynamics is more difficult to model than a vacuum with air resistance -- is physics biased against fluid dynamics?  Just because some things are more difficult does not mean the system is biased against it.\n\n&gt;It seems like there are bits and pieces of such \"zoomed in\" models in behavioral economics, but they don't seem to be integrated into any overarching framework.\n\nMostly because we haven't figured out how to integrate them yet, and what the benefits are.

We want to produce things where the social benefit exceeds the social cost. A firm might be able to produce something where the social benefit exceeds the social cost, but the social benefit is smaller than the social cost plus the tax.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about.  You're calling it a \"'free lunch' left on the table,\" because you're so steeped in the assumptions that are taught in economics.  Regardless of the political issues with that, the only reason you call it a potential free lunch is because of the models that economics uses.  \n\nIt's a free lunch because the math of economics doesn't handle the costs.  You say \"social benefit\" and \"social cost\" like those are defineable.  There are essentially an infinite number of benefits and an infinite number of costs to any situation like this.  The math can't handle that, but there are maths that could.  There are essentially an infinite number of particles on the earth, yet we can deal with gravity.  \n\nIn real life, there is no free lunch.  GDP is just a number.  It's a number that is measured from real people doing real things.  If a company can sell dog food that has poison in it, they will tend to, and it will kill real dogs, and they will make a profit until people find out.  If you import all your food, then other countries can hold your entire population hostage.  These things might not be the theoretical equilibrium, but they are what actually happens.  You can add another term on the equation to take it into account, but at some point, you just have to admit that the model does not describe reality very well.  \n\nIt would be one thing if it was physics and we were just dealing with atoms, but these are actual humans getting screwed.  Having their lives absolutely ruined because of these numbers that don't reflect reality.  \n\nImagine you're an alien.  You see people giving each other pieces of paper and then food and resources are distributed based on those pieces of paper.  You would probably see it as some kind of signalling mechanism.. like a hormone.  The fact is the body depends on its cells.  And society depends on its citizens.  I don't care what the GDP is, if society is full of people losing it and shooting up schools and stuff, it is messed up.  \n\nIf your math purports to describe human behavior and doesn't take that sort of thing into account then it is wrong.

It's not just my beliefs.  It's reality.  Economics does not explain the way that poor people behave in the real world.  When poor people have to take whatever job they come across first, it should not be modeled as a \"labor market.\"  The real behavior has no resemblance to the model in cases like these.

I was saying that economics says this.. or at least makes it very easy to jump to this conclusion from the simplest models.  \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2qy3qo/cmv_the_field_of_economics_is_inherently_biased/cnaq7ml\n\n At the bottom of that comment are the most common conclusions drawn about poor people from economic theory.  They are drawn because they are the easiest to draw based on the mathematical frameworks.\n\nI'm not saying that poor people are stupid.  I'm saying that the dominant forces that drive their decisions are not the same as rich people in every situation. \n\nWhen poor people apply for jobs, they often have to take the first one that comes along.  This is not how a market behaves.  Yet if you talk to an economist, they will almost always model it as a market.  I'm saying the mathematical tools that economics has used to describe people's decisionmaking often describe rich people's behavior more readily than poor people's.  \n\nIn chemistry, there is a phase transition between solid and liquid.  Different mathematical frameworks are used to describe the behavior of those substances.  \n\nRich people make purchases like they have all the time and money in the world to do it.  Poor people make purchases under more extreme constraints.  The point is, the equilibriums shift because the dominant forces are different."}, {"id": "2qy3qo", "body": "This is a much clearer way to say what I was trying to say:\n\nMarket frictions affect poor people more.

You end up with conclusions that are false.

In economics, the \"idealized laws\" often bear very little resemblance to reality (perfect labor market?  psht).  And the precise way in which they err almost always ignores the effects on poor people, just like treating the earth as flat will tend to cause you to err on the side of overestimating distances.  Rich people tend to behave much more like the idealized laws, and so when the models get close enough to base policy off of, they tend to err in their favor.\n\nFor instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.  However, this ignores the utility in preserving certain industries nationally, as well as incubation of industries to create a comparative advantage where one didn't exist before.  Of course you can patch together something that explains this, but the math is harder, and you would never actually predict it based off of the initial model.  \n\nBy presuming that people make the best economic decisions when information is evenly distributed, there is an implicit corollary that people not making the best economic decisions have less information. \n\nSo then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. While not accepted and clearly wrong, it is a valid conclusion to draw from the above assumptions.  So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\n\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I'm saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \n\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \n\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.  Not that they're consciously making up things to justify their relative wealth, but they lack information about real people's decision-making processes, and thus will tend to err one way versus the other.  Even if an economist disagrees with some of this, they will have to take classes where they are taught what has been filtered through this system. They will be more competitive for grants and fellowships if they work within the established frameworks.\n\nAlternative models would just start with different assumptions, and then you could go through the same process of continuously modifying the model until it can explain something like supply and demand.  \n\n\nEdit 1: it's a bit irrelevant to the discussion, but this video is what I'm talking about with entropy: http://youtu.be/e91D5UAz-f4?t=53m53s\n\nEdit 2: clarifications\n\nEdit 3: Removed distracting side-points and examples.\n\nEdit 4: Rephrased argument\n\n_________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In fact, at some point, they become the more dominant than the market dynamics themselves.  \n\nEvery market has infinite frictions.\n\nThere is no way to model infinite frictions.\n\nTherefore the market model does not adequately describe the behavior of poor people.\n\nTherefore to describe how income distribution affects the economy, you have to abandon the market.\n\nEven though there are ways to model *some* frictions, the most basic macro models treat the economy as a set of efficient markets.\n\nSomething like game theory might not have the same inherent bias, because it wouldn't have the same starting point as models using markets, so it wouldn't necessarily be a classist bias.\n\nOf course there's the argument \"but markets aren't the only part of the field.\"  I'm not trying to get into a semantic argument about the definition of \"field.\"  And lets be real, the concept of a market is pretty much what makes economics what it is. \n\n*********\n\nYou can read all this so the comments make sense, but everything below has been pretty much hashed out.\n\nEvery mathematical model requires basic assumptions, and the conclusions drawn from it will be inescapably colored by those assumptions.\n\nIn order to say that 1 apple plus another apple is 2 apples, you have to ignore time (eventually it's 0 apples) and space and all kinds of other things. Also, there are implicit definitions (\"plus\" means putting them next to each other or in the same container)\n\nIn economics, there seem to be base assumptions that make the math easier, but aren't strictly true.  You end up with conclusions that are false.  Of course for glaring inconsistencies, the models eventually get adjusted, but there's always a lag and a cost involved in refining the models, which makes it less likely to occur.  In the meantime, people latch onto those conclusions and use them for their own agenda.\n\nIn physics, there's the ideal gas law, etc.  These tend to hold pretty accurate and be pretty precise except at the very extremes.  In economics, the \"idealized laws\" often bear very little resemblance to reality (perfect labor market?  psht).  And the precise way in which they err almost always ignores the effects on poor people, just like treating the earth as flat will tend to cause you to err on the side of overestimating distances.  Rich people tend to behave much more like the idealized laws, and so when the models get close enough to base policy off of, they tend to err in their favor.\n\nFor instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.  However, this ignores the utility in preserving certain industries nationally, as well as incubation of industries to create a comparative advantage where one didn't exist before.  Of course you can patch together something that explains this, but the math is harder, and you would never actually predict it based off of the initial model.  \n\nBy presuming that people make the best economic decisions when information is evenly distributed, there is an implicit corollary that people not making the best economic decisions have less information. \n\nSo then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. While not accepted and clearly wrong, it is a valid conclusion to draw from the above assumptions.  So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\n\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I'm saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \n\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \n\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.  Not that they're consciously making up things to justify their relative wealth, but they lack information about real people's decision-making processes, and thus will tend to err one way versus the other.  Even if an economist disagrees with some of this, they will have to take classes where they are taught what has been filtered through this system. They will be more competitive for grants and fellowships if they work within the established frameworks.\n\nAlternative models would just start with different assumptions, and then you could go through the same process of continuously modifying the model until it can explain something like supply and demand.  \n\n\nEdit 1: it's a bit irrelevant to the discussion, but this video is what I'm talking about with entropy: http://youtu.be/e91D5UAz-f4?t=53m53s\n\nEdit 2: clarifications\n\nEdit 3: Removed distracting side-points and examples.\n\nEdit 4: Rephrased argument\n\n_________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
