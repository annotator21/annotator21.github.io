It's the somewhat outdated copyright laws we have in Germany (\u00a722 KUG). So while you are perfectly fine to record them, you are not allowed to distribute or share those recordings, publicly or privately, without their explicit consent.\n\n\nI see where you are coming from and I wholeheartedly agree that whoever discharges powers of office (such as a police officer on duty) should expect to be held accountable for his/her behaviour by the people while acting in his/her official capacity. As a means of checks and balances, much like the press are supposed to be \"natural\" counter-balance to the government. \n\nAnd that is all well an good when we talk about (illegal) misconduct or misuse of power, i.e. police brutality or corruption. \n\n\n**However, consider this.**\n\nNot all police officers are bad or corrupt, especially not in Germany. You yourself state that cases of police violence are a rare occurence here. \n\nAnd for some officers privacy or anonymity is crucial and exposing them could not only be detrimental to an investigation, but also highly dangerous to their health or life for that matter.\n\nThere is a reason all kinds of police special units (i.e., SEK, GSG9 - for the non-Germans these are comparable to SWAT and the FBI HRT) wear balaclavas so their faces are covered. \n\nSay I'm a police investigator and have been investigatin organized crimes for months in trying to find evidence to make charges stick. Some day in a completely unrelated event, someone films me and puts my face all over youtube. This event doesn't even have to show me doing anything illegal or immoral. Maybe I'm just sitting around with some colleagues at a donut shop and someone films it and puts it on the internet because he thinks it's funny. Criminals have internet too, and now they see my face and maybe, just maybe, recongnize it and make a connection. This is is not only highly problematic to the investigation, because if they see me around them they will instantly know I'm police. But also it could get pretty bad for me privately. They now know what I look like and might find out where I live and all of a sudden my wife and two kids are in danger.... you see where I'm going with this?\n\n\nWhile I do agree that it is perfectly reasonable to expect to be put yourself under a lot of public scrutiny once you sign up for the police service. There is also a reasonable expectation that you might incur bodily harm while on duty. You knew that when you signed up for it.\n\n**I do not** however find it reasonable to expect an officer to forego all expectations of privacy and place his family in danger. It is after all a job, and when he/she comes home from work he/she should not have to fear for his/her life and that of his family.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnglk3r", "body": "If you're making taxpayer dollars at the time, you should be subject to recording, unless an exception is made by referendum.\n\nThey do it to us, why can't we do it to them?"}, {"id": "2rieng", "body": "Hello reddit,\n\nI'm from Germany and given that I've travelled through the United States for a couple of months and talked to a lot of (\"free minded\") people, my views about the importance of freedom have changed dramatically.\n\nWhat I've come to realize is that we the people are the one who make the law.\n(Theoretically) we delegate our authority to public officials and police men to have them enforce the laws **we** voted on to have in our society.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause we delegate a certain amount of authority to these people they are in a position in which they *could* abuse the power we give them.\n\nThus we need to be able to check on them and, in case of doubt, proof what really happened.\n\nThough here in Germany we are **not** allowed to film policemen! They have the same kind of personal rights as every other citizen.\nSo we basically give them *more* authority and rights (I can't just demand other citizens to show me their ID) but *equal* accountability and personal rights.\n\nIt's true that police violence is very rare here in Germany, but given our history I think it's absolutely **crucial** that we as the people have the opportunity to hold every authority accountable and challenge it (if necessary) so that something like the Third Reich cannot happen again.\n\nThough, most people I talk to don't see the reason why public officials should have less personal rights (e.g. be filmed without permission while on duty) than regular citizens, given the very rare cases of police-violence and power abuse and because \"they're people like you and I\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n--\ntl;dr: **CMV**: Public officials should **not** have an equal right to privacy and be able to decide whether or not they want to be filmed/recorded. They were elected by the people and we should be able to hold them accountable for their actions while on duty.

If there is specific indication of illegal publishing, seizing the photo-, videomaterial may be justified.\"\n\n(Original: \"Das Filmen oder Fotografieren eines polizeilichen Einsatzes begr\u00fcndet allein noch nicht die gegenw\u00e4rtige Gefahr, die Aufnahmen w\u00fcrden unter Versto\u00df gegen \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 33 KunstUrhG (Recht am eigenen Bild) verbreitet. Deuten konkrete Anhaltspunkte auf eine rechtswidrige Verbreitung der Aufnahmen hin, kann die Sicherstellung von Foto- und Filmmaterial gerechtfertigt sein.\")\n\nIt does not define what qualifies as specific indication of you publishing the material. A slightly annoyed demeanor *might* be enough. (my interpretation)\n\nIt's also important to know that the German definition of \"publication\" supposedly *includes* publication in private (e.g. family members). (I couldn't find the original law, though. It might be in \u00a7 17 Verbreitungsrecht or in a definition of the word \"\u00d6ffentlichkeit\" [public])\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If there is specific indication of illegal publishing, seizing the photo-, videomaterial may be justified.\"\n\n(Original: \"Das Filmen oder Fotografieren eines polizeilichen Einsatzes begr\u00fcndet allein noch nicht die gegenw\u00e4rtige Gefahr, die Aufnahmen w\u00fcrden unter Versto\u00df gegen \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 33 KunstUrhG (Recht am eigenen Bild) verbreitet. Deuten konkrete Anhaltspunkte auf eine rechtswidrige Verbreitung der Aufnahmen hin, kann die Sicherstellung von Foto- und Filmmaterial gerechtfertigt sein.\")\n\nIt does not define what qualifies as specific indication of you publishing the material. A slightly annoyed demeanor *might* be enough. (my interpretation)\n\nIt's also important to know that the German definition of \"publication\" supposedly *includes* publication in private (e.g. family members). (I couldn't find the original law, though. It might be in \u00a7 17 Verbreitungsrecht or in a definition of the word \"\u00d6ffentlichkeit\" [public])\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We DO and SHOULD have a right to privacy.\nBut to be realistic here: We've lost that right a long time ago. In our current information era there is very little privacy left for the individual.\n\nThus, I think, we in Germany should also be allowed to film other people in public spaces. They can decide whether or not they want the material to be published without them being blurred out.\n\nPublic servants should be no different.\n\n&gt; \"justify removing privacy of normal citizens\"\n\nThat's a *very* good point I have not really thought about yet.\nIt might indeed backfire by people (authorities) saying: \"You're right! We're protecting you and you have the right to hold us accountable for our actions on duty. So we are going to do the same thing, in order to keep everybody save.\"\nNow we have a dystopian futuristic society with cameras on every corner, virtually no privacy whatsoever and an even stronger government because people can now be declared *enemies of the system* even easier.\n\nBut I think this should be more like a wake-up call for people.\nWait a second, it's **our** country! **We** make the laws and decide what kind of laws we have.\n\nBut I will think about it more and it's a very good point!\n\n&gt; \"Have you ever managed employees beneath you?\"\nNo, I'm pretty young and still in University.\n\n&gt;\"I flourish when given independence, privacy, and autonomy. Vote for trustworthy people, and you won't have to spy on them to keep them in check.\"\n\nI agree! I've heard about stuff like \"Fed-Ex-Days\" where employees are given maximum autonomy and produce way better results. I'm a huge fan of that and think that it's best for both employers and employees. \n\nI belief the same could be true for police. You, as a policeman, want to feel that the people *trust* you and don't need to film every interaction you have with them, in order to be save. Understandable.\nBut *trust* should be a choice! If police were always respectful and polite nobody would even see the need to record them.\nBut sadly that is not our reality today. Power abuse *does* happen and sometimes has severe consequences for the individual.\n\nAnd wrongdoing by a policemen can do way bigger harm then wrongdoing of an employer. (Generally speaking)\n\nSo even though I agree with you (from my best perspective today) and would neither want to work with too little independence and trust nor employ people that I feel the need to *spy on*.\n\nThe problem with this is that our police is not *actually* elected by us. We've set up other authorities to determine for us if they should be police or not. \n\nThus I don't think the argument of trust, independence and privacy leading to better results and more content workers is applicable to police."}, {"id": "cng6cih", "body": "I agree with you about police officers, but what are you envisioning with public officials?

I tend to think this will occur, with malignant men being left in their graves, never aware of what the rest of us embark on. That's an option too, and such ideas of humanity uniting and making utopia and putting an end to evil, and resurrection, is an ancient idea that people say God promised.

In case one is not familiar currently the minimum wage is passed into passed as an hourly figure into law. To update the figure it requires another law to amend the older one. The Federal Government sets a minimum wage which is a universal minimum for all businesses operating within the United States. Individual states may opt to raise the minimum wage above that level if they wish.\n\nHard coding the minimum wage into law in this way is inefficient and usually damaging to most parties involved. Political parties and politicians suffer because it distracts them from working on other issues which may be more important, forcing them to make what should be trivial adjustments and sets up a perpetually recurring fight. Depending on which party has control of the house, senate, and white house it may be impossible to get any legislation through congress or the state level of government for years at a time. To get the minimum wage raised requires a large amount of political capital because it is such a controversial issue. Raising the minimum wage is a zero sum game with one of the two parties benefiting from action or lack of it. Due to this it is a toxic subject to breech in congress.\n\nWorkers suffer from the fighting in congress because for long periods of time they experience either low or no wage increases meaning that for many years their income does not keep track with the rate of inflation. Because of this they may not be able to buy the things they need with their paycheck thus defeating the point of minimum wage.\n\nBusinesses suffer because they have uncertainty over their labor costs from the fighting. While they may get savings due to declining wages relative to purchasing power in the long term they have to worry about not only the demands of the labor market but also the uncertainty of who will win a given election and what the political priorities of the newly elected majority will be. This creates uncertainty and may cause employers to delay hiring decisions and postpone growth.\n\nIn short there aren't many people who truly win with the way we currently adjust minimum wage. One of the key problems with the current system is we don't give bureaucrats the authority to do their job. It is the ultimate in micromanagement literally requiring an act of congress to do anything. This is a systemic issue in almost all areas of the federal government but it's especially acute here. At it's core congress should only focus on the big picture. It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.\n\n**The Cost of Labor**\n\nMinimum wage is a CMV in and of itself and has been discussed in many other threads on this sub in the past. **I don't want people to argue about whether or not there should be a minimum wage in this thread or the specific figure that the minimum wage should be.** The assumptions and limitations here are to limit what would invariably be off topic debates, I want to discuss this specific issue and not a broader one. Let's just go with the assumption that the existence of a minimum wage is a given and getting rid of it is not an option.\n\nThe greatest benefit to a minimum wage is that if someone is able to get a job and get enough hours to work full time they will have enough money that to support themselves without having to rely on public assistance. At the risk of being overly simplistic the key idea is that there is a given minimum amount of money that a person must spend every month to stay alive. There is a higher amount of money that a person must spend to have what society would consider an acceptable standard of living. If someone does not have the money to pay these costs then they will either eventually die and/or live in substandard conditions unless an outside force intervenes. Let's also assume that a person has no way of getting resources other than buying them at fair market value and can't grow, steal, beg, or barter for them.\n\nIf the we as a society decide that we should not let people die for lack of money, then the only way for them to get the resources they need is for everyone else who has money to pay a portion of their earnings in taxes. The taxes are then used to purchase these resources for the individuals that don't have the ability to buy them for themselves.\n\nIf you allow businesses to pay people less than what it costs for one person to afford these resources then you are shifting the cost of supporting that person from the owners of the business to everybody in society. This is unfair because the business is the one that is benefiting from the labor of this individual yet they are not paying market value for it. As such it should be able to establish that the amount of money necessary for self-sufficiency is the basic cost of human capital.\n\nThis makes more sense when you think of labor in the same way you would think of other commodities. If you were to take a crop such as coffee and allow farmers to lease or buy land at below market value then the price of coffee wouldn't be accurate. I don't think most people would think it would be fair to expect other people to pay for the farmer's land.\n\n**The Proposed Solution**\n\nWe have hopefully established that there is a basic cost for human capital. To calculate what the cost is for human labor all one would need to do is add up the costs necessary to buy the basic resources every year and then divide by the number of given working hours in a year. As above I would like to request that people not argue about the exact definitions of what should be included in the definition of necessary resources and how many hours is fair to work in a week, those are all debates for other CMVs.\n\nThis should theoretically be very easy but we here we run into another problem with the minimum wage. Not all areas have equal costs of living and thus the cost of necessary resources is dependant entirely on where you are located and what the lowest cost for those goods in that area is. This changes on not only a city by city basis but also on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis within a city. You could have millions of different answers for minimum wages dependant on many different factors.\n\nTo simplify this we could group similar areas into different regions and run this calculation for each. This approach would make more sense for businesses because they could make more efficient decisions about where they should hire labor from based on the cost of living. For higher paying jobs they already do this, but this could see an explosion of jobs in low cost areas due to the low minimum wage. One of the core principles of economics is that incentives matter. If costs aren't accurate then the decisions that companies make will be biased and it will result in a more inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nThe next thing you would need to address is how do you get the data on the cost of living. For the most part we are already collecting this data for the consumer price index. The CPI would not be useful for this however because it includes data on all things in the economy, not just the basic resources needed to maintain life. To get this right you would need to create a new price index specifically for the minimum wage.\n\nAdditionally prices constantly change, that is the reason for automatic updates to the minimum wage to begin with. If you had the data you could update the minimum wage as frequently as desired. Practically speaking however, changing the minimum wage frequently would create a compliance nightmare for businesses and regulators. To reduce this burden making it so the minimum only adjusts on longer timescales is more beneficial. The best approach here is likely to update the minimum wage on an annual basis.\n\nTo offset variations in market prices and within regions as well as the risk of having incomplete or faulty data it would only make sense that the minimum wage has some sort of padding on top of it as a margin of error. As an initial estimate I would assume this margin of error would somewhere between 1.5% and 7%, because the rates of inflation are usually between 2%-3% within a given calendar year. However the exact number of course could be adjusted based on data and you would need to determine how variable prices and the commonality of errors to find the optimum value. Developing a formula would allow you to make minimum wages dynamically adjust based on the previous year's volatility or specific conditions in a certain region. When calculating margins of error it would likely be better to err on the side of a higher wage than a lower one.\n\n(**tl;dr**) What you'd end up with is:\n\nMinimum Hourly Wage = ( Regional Minimum Wage Price Index for Year / Full Time Working Hours per Year ) * ( 1 + Padding Margin Percentage )\n\n**Previous attempts at this idea**\n\nIn the 1970s during the period of double digit inflation rates this idea was floated by the Democrat party and made significant headway but received substantial opposition because of the high interest rates and the fear that these would remain for a long period of time.\n\nEdit: /u/srak has pointed out that this has existed in Belgium since 1919.\n\nFeel free to point out any problems you see in the idea of the minimum cost of human capital since this is essential to the promise that the wages should automatically adjust. Without that assumption everything else doesn't make any sense. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The Federal Government sets a minimum wage which is a universal minimum for all businesses operating within the United States.

Political parties and politicians suffer because it distracts them from working on other issues which may be more important, forcing them to make what should be trivial adjustments and sets up a perpetually recurring fight.

One of the key problems with the current system is we don't give bureaucrats the authority to do their job. It is the ultimate in micromanagement literally requiring an act of congress to do anything. This is a systemic issue in almost all areas of the federal government but it's especially acute here. At it's core congress should only focus on the big picture. It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.\n\n**The Cost of Labor**\n\nMinimum wage is a CMV in and of itself and has been discussed in many other threads on this sub in the past. **I don't want people to argue about whether or not there should be a minimum wage in this thread or the specific figure that the minimum wage should be.** The assumptions and limitations here are to limit what would invariably be off topic debates, I want to discuss this specific issue and not a broader one. Let's just go with the assumption that the existence of a minimum wage is a given and getting rid of it is not an option.\n\nThe greatest benefit to a minimum wage is that if someone is able to get a job and get enough hours to work full time they will have enough money that to support themselves without having to rely on public assistance. At the risk of being overly simplistic the key idea is that there is a given minimum amount of money that a person must spend every month to stay alive. There is a higher amount of money that a person must spend to have what society would consider an acceptable standard of living. If someone does not have the money to pay these costs then they will either eventually die and/or live in substandard conditions unless an outside force intervenes. Let's also assume that a person has no way of getting resources other than buying them at fair market value and can't grow, steal, beg, or barter for them.\n\nIf the we as a society decide that we should not let people die for lack of money, then the only way for them to get the resources they need is for everyone else who has money to pay a portion of their earnings in taxes. The taxes are then used to purchase these resources for the individuals that don't have the ability to buy them for themselves.\n\nIf you allow businesses to pay people less than what it costs for one person to afford these resources then you are shifting the cost of supporting that person from the owners of the business to everybody in society. This is unfair because the business is the one that is benefiting from the labor of this individual yet they are not paying market value for it. As such it should be able to establish that the amount of money necessary for self-sufficiency is the basic cost of human capital.\n\nThis makes more sense when you think of labor in the same way you would think of other commodities. If you were to take a crop such as coffee and allow farmers to lease or buy land at below market value then the price of coffee wouldn't be accurate. I don't think most people would think it would be fair to expect other people to pay for the farmer's land.\n\n**The Proposed Solution**\n\nWe have hopefully established that there is a basic cost for human capital. To calculate what the cost is for human labor all one would need to do is add up the costs necessary to buy the basic resources every year and then divide by the number of given working hours in a year. As above I would like to request that people not argue about the exact definitions of what should be included in the definition of necessary resources and how many hours is fair to work in a week, those are all debates for other CMVs.\n\nThis should theoretically be very easy but we here we run into another problem with the minimum wage. Not all areas have equal costs of living and thus the cost of necessary resources is dependant entirely on where you are located and what the lowest cost for those goods in that area is. This changes on not only a city by city basis but also on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis within a city. You could have millions of different answers for minimum wages dependant on many different factors.\n\nTo simplify this we could group similar areas into different regions and run this calculation for each. This approach would make more sense for businesses because they could make more efficient decisions about where they should hire labor from based on the cost of living. For higher paying jobs they already do this, but this could see an explosion of jobs in low cost areas due to the low minimum wage. One of the core principles of economics is that incentives matter. If costs aren't accurate then the decisions that companies make will be biased and it will result in a more inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nThe next thing you would need to address is how do you get the data on the cost of living. For the most part we are already collecting this data for the consumer price index. The CPI would not be useful for this however because it includes data on all things in the economy, not just the basic resources needed to maintain life. To get this right you would need to create a new price index specifically for the minimum wage.\n\nAdditionally prices constantly change, that is the reason for automatic updates to the minimum wage to begin with. If you had the data you could update the minimum wage as frequently as desired. Practically speaking however, changing the minimum wage frequently would create a compliance nightmare for businesses and regulators. To reduce this burden making it so the minimum only adjusts on longer timescales is more beneficial. The best approach here is likely to update the minimum wage on an annual basis.\n\nTo offset variations in market prices and within regions as well as the risk of having incomplete or faulty data it would only make sense that the minimum wage has some sort of padding on top of it as a margin of error. As an initial estimate I would assume this margin of error would somewhere between 1.5% and 7%, because the rates of inflation are usually between 2%-3% within a given calendar year. However the exact number of course could be adjusted based on data and you would need to determine how variable prices and the commonality of errors to find the optimum value. Developing a formula would allow you to make minimum wages dynamically adjust based on the previous year's volatility or specific conditions in a certain region. When calculating margins of error it would likely be better to err on the side of a higher wage than a lower one.\n\n(**tl;dr**) What you'd end up with is:\n\nMinimum Hourly Wage = ( Regional Minimum Wage Price Index for Year / Full Time Working Hours per Year ) * ( 1 + Padding Margin Percentage )\n\n**Previous attempts at this idea**\n\nIn the 1970s during the period of double digit inflation rates this idea was floated by the Democrat party and made significant headway but received substantial opposition because of the high interest rates and the fear that these would remain for a long period of time.\n\nEdit: /u/srak has pointed out that this has existed in Belgium since 1919.\n\nFeel free to point out any problems you see in the idea of the minimum cost of human capital since this is essential to the promise that the wages should automatically adjust. Without that assumption everything else doesn't make any sense. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

As above I would like to request that people not argue about the exact definitions of what should be included in the definition of necessary resources and how many hours is fair to work in a week, those are all debates for other CMVs.\n\nThis should theoretically be very easy but we here we run into another problem with the minimum wage. Not all areas have equal costs of living and thus the cost of necessary resources is dependant entirely on where you are located and what the lowest cost for those goods in that area is. This changes on not only a city by city basis but also on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis within a city. You could have millions of different answers for minimum wages dependant on many different factors.\n\nTo simplify this we could group similar areas into different regions and run this calculation for each. This approach would make more sense for businesses because they could make more efficient decisions about where they should hire labor from based on the cost of living. For higher paying jobs they already do this, but this could see an explosion of jobs in low cost areas due to the low minimum wage. One of the core principles of economics is that incentives matter. If costs aren't accurate then the decisions that companies make will be biased and it will result in a more inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nThe next thing you would need to address is how do you get the data on the cost of living. For the most part we are already collecting this data for the consumer price index. The CPI would not be useful for this however because it includes data on all things in the economy, not just the basic resources needed to maintain life. To get this right you would need to create a new price index specifically for the minimum wage.\n\nAdditionally prices constantly change, that is the reason for automatic updates to the minimum wage to begin with. If you had the data you could update the minimum wage as frequently as desired. Practically speaking however, changing the minimum wage frequently would create a compliance nightmare for businesses and regulators. To reduce this burden making it so the minimum only adjusts on longer timescales is more beneficial. The best approach here is likely to update the minimum wage on an annual basis.\n\nTo offset variations in market prices and within regions as well as the risk of having incomplete or faulty data it would only make sense that the minimum wage has some sort of padding on top of it as a margin of error. As an initial estimate I would assume this margin of error would somewhere between 1.5% and 7%, because the rates of inflation are usually between 2%-3% within a given calendar year. However the exact number of course could be adjusted based on data and you would need to determine how variable prices and the commonality of errors to find the optimum value. Developing a formula would allow you to make minimum wages dynamically adjust based on the previous year's volatility or specific conditions in a certain region. When calculating margins of error it would likely be better to err on the side of a higher wage than a lower one.\n\n(**tl;dr**) What you'd end up with is:\n\nMinimum Hourly Wage = ( Regional Minimum Wage Price Index for Year / Full Time Working Hours per Year ) * ( 1 + Padding Margin Percentage )\n\n**Previous attempts at this idea**\n\nIn the 1970s during the period of double digit inflation rates this idea was floated by the Democrat party and made significant headway but received substantial opposition because of the high interest rates and the fear that these would remain for a long period of time.\n\nEdit: /u/srak has pointed out that this has existed in Belgium since 1919.\n\nFeel free to point out any problems you see in the idea of the minimum cost of human capital since this is essential to the promise that the wages should automatically adjust.

I am thoroughly impressed :)."}, {"id": "2rhve5", "body": "Note: While this general argument may apply to other countries points made below will be specific to the point of view of the United States.\n\nRecently it's been in the news that many states have increased minimum wages this year without action from the federal government. In case one is not familiar currently the minimum wage is passed into passed as an hourly figure into law. To update the figure it requires another law to amend the older one. The Federal Government sets a minimum wage which is a universal minimum for all businesses operating within the United States. Individual states may opt to raise the minimum wage above that level if they wish.\n\nHard coding the minimum wage into law in this way is inefficient and usually damaging to most parties involved. Political parties and politicians suffer because it distracts them from working on other issues which may be more important, forcing them to make what should be trivial adjustments and sets up a perpetually recurring fight. Depending on which party has control of the house, senate, and white house it may be impossible to get any legislation through congress or the state level of government for years at a time. To get the minimum wage raised requires a large amount of political capital because it is such a controversial issue. Raising the minimum wage is a zero sum game with one of the two parties benefiting from action or lack of it. Due to this it is a toxic subject to breech in congress.\n\nWorkers suffer from the fighting in congress because for long periods of time they experience either low or no wage increases meaning that for many years their income does not keep track with the rate of inflation. Because of this they may not be able to buy the things they need with their paycheck thus defeating the point of minimum wage.\n\nBusinesses suffer because they have uncertainty over their labor costs from the fighting. While they may get savings due to declining wages relative to purchasing power in the long term they have to worry about not only the demands of the labor market but also the uncertainty of who will win a given election and what the political priorities of the newly elected majority will be. This creates uncertainty and may cause employers to delay hiring decisions and postpone growth.\n\nIn short there aren't many people who truly win with the way we currently adjust minimum wage. One of the key problems with the current system is we don't give bureaucrats the authority to do their job. It is the ultimate in micromanagement literally requiring an act of congress to do anything. This is a systemic issue in almost all areas of the federal government but it's especially acute here. At it's core congress should only focus on the big picture. It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.\n\n**The Cost of Labor**\n\nMinimum wage is a CMV in and of itself and has been discussed in many other threads on this sub in the past. **I don't want people to argue about whether or not there should be a minimum wage in this thread or the specific figure that the minimum wage should be.** The assumptions and limitations here are to limit what would invariably be off topic debates, I want to discuss this specific issue and not a broader one. Let's just go with the assumption that the existence of a minimum wage is a given and getting rid of it is not an option.\n\nThe greatest benefit to a minimum wage is that if someone is able to get a job and get enough hours to work full time they will have enough money that to support themselves without having to rely on public assistance. At the risk of being overly simplistic the key idea is that there is a given minimum amount of money that a person must spend every month to stay alive. There is a higher amount of money that a person must spend to have what society would consider an acceptable standard of living. If someone does not have the money to pay these costs then they will either eventually die and/or live in substandard conditions unless an outside force intervenes. Let's also assume that a person has no way of getting resources other than buying them at fair market value and can't grow, steal, beg, or barter for them.\n\nIf the we as a society decide that we should not let people die for lack of money, then the only way for them to get the resources they need is for everyone else who has money to pay a portion of their earnings in taxes. The taxes are then used to purchase these resources for the individuals that don't have the ability to buy them for themselves.\n\nIf you allow businesses to pay people less than what it costs for one person to afford these resources then you are shifting the cost of supporting that person from the owners of the business to everybody in society. This is unfair because the business is the one that is benefiting from the labor of this individual yet they are not paying market value for it. As such it should be able to establish that the amount of money necessary for self-sufficiency is the basic cost of human capital.\n\nThis makes more sense when you think of labor in the same way you would think of other commodities. If you were to take a crop such as coffee and allow farmers to lease or buy land at below market value then the price of coffee wouldn't be accurate. I don't think most people would think it would be fair to expect other people to pay for the farmer's land.\n\n**The Proposed Solution**\n\nWe have hopefully established that there is a basic cost for human capital.

If they can't even do their simplest job what makes you think they would be able to react with tailored solutions every year?\n\n&gt;  Which really seems to be the objective of your proposal - to say that inflation ought not to impact the lowest earning members of society.\n\nIf living costs and wages do not go up then the paycheck of an individual will no longer be enough to cover the cost of living and the government will have to pick up the tab. Somebody is paying for inflation, either the company or everyone else.\n\n&gt; Within that context I think it is important to keep in mind that lowering the minimum wage through inflation can act as a kind of economic safety valve - driving down the costs of labor in periods of high inflation (which would almost certainly be one of the things the inflation is naturally attempting to correct).\n\nIt is impossible to lower the cost of labor below the minimum cost of production. All failing to raise the minimum wage is doing is giving a business employing that individual a subsidy by everyone else. "}, {"id": "2rhve5", "body": "Note: While this general argument may apply to other countries points made below will be specific to the point of view of the United States.\n\nRecently it's been in the news that many states have increased minimum wages this year without action from the federal government. In case one is not familiar currently the minimum wage is passed into passed as an hourly figure into law. To update the figure it requires another law to amend the older one. The Federal Government sets a minimum wage which is a universal minimum for all businesses operating within the United States. Individual states may opt to raise the minimum wage above that level if they wish.\n\nHard coding the minimum wage into law in this way is inefficient and usually damaging to most parties involved. Political parties and politicians suffer because it distracts them from working on other issues which may be more important, forcing them to make what should be trivial adjustments and sets up a perpetually recurring fight. Depending on which party has control of the house, senate, and white house it may be impossible to get any legislation through congress or the state level of government for years at a time. To get the minimum wage raised requires a large amount of political capital because it is such a controversial issue. Raising the minimum wage is a zero sum game with one of the two parties benefiting from action or lack of it. Due to this it is a toxic subject to breech in congress.\n\nWorkers suffer from the fighting in congress because for long periods of time they experience either low or no wage increases meaning that for many years their income does not keep track with the rate of inflation. Because of this they may not be able to buy the things they need with their paycheck thus defeating the point of minimum wage.\n\nBusinesses suffer because they have uncertainty over their labor costs from the fighting. While they may get savings due to declining wages relative to purchasing power in the long term they have to worry about not only the demands of the labor market but also the uncertainty of who will win a given election and what the political priorities of the newly elected majority will be. This creates uncertainty and may cause employers to delay hiring decisions and postpone growth.\n\nIn short there aren't many people who truly win with the way we currently adjust minimum wage. One of the key problems with the current system is we don't give bureaucrats the authority to do their job. It is the ultimate in micromanagement literally requiring an act of congress to do anything. This is a systemic issue in almost all areas of the federal government but it's especially acute here. At it's core congress should only focus on the big picture. It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.\n\n**The Cost of Labor**\n\nMinimum wage is a CMV in and of itself and has been discussed in many other threads on this sub in the past. **I don't want people to argue about whether or not there should be a minimum wage in this thread or the specific figure that the minimum wage should be.** The assumptions and limitations here are to limit what would invariably be off topic debates, I want to discuss this specific issue and not a broader one. Let's just go with the assumption that the existence of a minimum wage is a given and getting rid of it is not an option.\n\nThe greatest benefit to a minimum wage is that if someone is able to get a job and get enough hours to work full time they will have enough money that to support themselves without having to rely on public assistance. At the risk of being overly simplistic the key idea is that there is a given minimum amount of money that a person must spend every month to stay alive. There is a higher amount of money that a person must spend to have what society would consider an acceptable standard of living. If someone does not have the money to pay these costs then they will either eventually die and/or live in substandard conditions unless an outside force intervenes. Let's also assume that a person has no way of getting resources other than buying them at fair market value and can't grow, steal, beg, or barter for them.\n\nIf the we as a society decide that we should not let people die for lack of money, then the only way for them to get the resources they need is for everyone else who has money to pay a portion of their earnings in taxes. The taxes are then used to purchase these resources for the individuals that don't have the ability to buy them for themselves.\n\nIf you allow businesses to pay people less than what it costs for one person to afford these resources then you are shifting the cost of supporting that person from the owners of the business to everybody in society. This is unfair because the business is the one that is benefiting from the labor of this individual yet they are not paying market value for it. As such it should be able to establish that the amount of money necessary for self-sufficiency is the basic cost of human capital.\n\nThis makes more sense when you think of labor in the same way you would think of other commodities. If you were to take a crop such as coffee and allow farmers to lease or buy land at below market value then the price of coffee wouldn't be accurate. I don't think most people would think it would be fair to expect other people to pay for the farmer's land.\n\n**The Proposed Solution**\n\nWe have hopefully established that there is a basic cost for human capital. To calculate what the cost is for human labor all one would need to do is add up the costs necessary to buy the basic resources every year and then divide by the number of given working hours in a year. As above I would like to request that people not argue about the exact definitions of what should be included in the definition of necessary resources and how many hours is fair to work in a week, those are all debates for other CMVs.\n\nThis should theoretically be very easy but we here we run into another problem with the minimum wage. Not all areas have equal costs of living and thus the cost of necessary resources is dependant entirely on where you are located and what the lowest cost for those goods in that area is. This changes on not only a city by city basis but also on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis within a city. You could have millions of different answers for minimum wages dependant on many different factors.\n\nTo simplify this we could group similar areas into different regions and run this calculation for each. This approach would make more sense for businesses because they could make more efficient decisions about where they should hire labor from based on the cost of living. For higher paying jobs they already do this, but this could see an explosion of jobs in low cost areas due to the low minimum wage. One of the core principles of economics is that incentives matter. If costs aren't accurate then the decisions that companies make will be biased and it will result in a more inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nThe next thing you would need to address is how do you get the data on the cost of living. For the most part we are already collecting this data for the consumer price index. The CPI would not be useful for this however because it includes data on all things in the economy, not just the basic resources needed to maintain life. To get this right you would need to create a new price index specifically for the minimum wage.\n\nAdditionally prices constantly change, that is the reason for automatic updates to the minimum wage to begin with. If you had the data you could update the minimum wage as frequently as desired. Practically speaking however, changing the minimum wage frequently would create a compliance nightmare for businesses and regulators. To reduce this burden making it so the minimum only adjusts on longer timescales is more beneficial. The best approach here is likely to update the minimum wage on an annual basis.\n\nTo offset variations in market prices and within regions as well as the risk of having incomplete or faulty data it would only make sense that the minimum wage has some sort of padding on top of it as a margin of error. As an initial estimate I would assume this margin of error would somewhere between 1.5% and 7%, because the rates of inflation are usually between 2%-3% within a given calendar year. However the exact number of course could be adjusted based on data and you would need to determine how variable prices and the commonality of errors to find the optimum value. Developing a formula would allow you to make minimum wages dynamically adjust based on the previous year's volatility or specific conditions in a certain region. When calculating margins of error it would likely be better to err on the side of a higher wage than a lower one.\n\n(**tl;dr**) What you'd end up with is:\n\nMinimum Hourly Wage = ( Regional Minimum Wage Price Index for Year / Full Time Working Hours per Year ) * ( 1 + Padding Margin Percentage )\n\n**Previous attempts at this idea**\n\nIn the 1970s during the period of double digit inflation rates this idea was floated by the Democrat party and made significant headway but received substantial opposition because of the high interest rates and the fear that these would remain for a long period of time.\n\nEdit: /u/srak has pointed out that this has existed in Belgium since 1919.\n\nFeel free to point out any problems you see in the idea of the minimum cost of human capital since this is essential to the promise that the wages should automatically adjust. Without that assumption everything else doesn't make any sense. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

You don't need CFA certification to vote.\n\n&gt;We already have a federal minimum wage, you could implement this without changing anything at all about how the system works.\n\nYet, to implicate your system you'd have to edit the 10th amendment.\n\n&gt;As for getting rich if you only put the basics in the price index I don't think anyone would be getting rich.\n\n[The average apartment in manhattan rents for $4000/month.](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140515/central-harlem/manhattans-average-rents-hit-4000-report-finds) based on this, a minimum wage employee would have to make $48K a year post-tax JUST for housing.

This is unrealistic.\n\n"}, {"id": "cng1wlq", "body": "&gt; Yet, to implicate your system you'd have to edit the 10th amendment.\n\nI don't understand why. We already have a federal minimum wage, you aren't changing if it exists or not you are just changing the way in which the minimum wage is calculated.\n\nCurrently the legal justification for the minimum wage is based on the interstate commerce clause of the constitution. [This has already been decided in case law](http://www.streetlaw.org/en/Page/375/Justifying_the_Implied_Powers_of_the_Federal_Government) and I don't think it would introduce any new case.\n\n&gt; Source? It's relatively easy to measure politics, you have a plethora of mediums in terms of analyzing, learning and participating in politics. \n\nGenerally speaking though there are far more resources available for predicting markets. We have at least 3 full time television networks on US cable dedicated to trying to do it and have thousands of economists and analysts all making predictions. Market data is readily available and easy to find. All you need to do is buy a connection to the bloomberg API and you can get more data than you ever wanted. High Frequency Traders make a living off trying to predicting the market.\n\nI'll try to find a source on using predictive analytics to determine the output of politics. I know of [at least one startup](https://www.fiscalnote.com/) that their entire business is on predicting politics. However there aren't nearly as many of these companies. Data is more spotty you are limited to what is on the news, election data, opinion polls, and focus groups. I don't know if you've looked at congress recently but I don't have any idea what is going to pass or not pass and I don't think even the parties themselves do.\n\n&gt; The average apartment in manhattan rents for $4000/month. based on this, a minimum wage employee would have to make $48K a year post-tax JUST for housing. This would mean that the man taking your order at burger king would be making in excess of $60K per year. This is unrealistic.\n\nBut a minimum wage employee wouldn't be able to afford the average apartment. The whole point of a price index is that it is based on the **minimum** cost of living. That doesn't mean living on the upper east side with a view of central park, that might mean living in New Jersey or Queens and taking the train to work every day.\n\nEven if you were just going to take Manhattan prices you would be taking rents at say the 15th percentile or roughly 2 standard deviations below the median for the price index. Think studio apartments in Harlem. Surely that wouldn't cost anywhere near $4k a month.\n\nNote: I'm not from NYC so please forgive me if I don't have good local knowledge."}, {"id": "cng11b8", "body": "&gt;Raising the minimum wage is a zero sum game\n\nNegative, see [deadweight loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss)\n\n&gt;This creates uncertainty and may cause employers to delay hiring decisions and postpone growth.\n\nNo barista in the US is being denied a job due to what may happen in 2016.\n\n&gt;It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.\n\nGood luck trying to abolish states' rights.

If minimum wage gets raised the republicans will not do will with their base. If it does not the democrats will not do well.\n\nAs for DWL surely you would have this as a factor in increasing the supply of labor but reducing the demand. However theoretically the net effect on the economy should be the same because the money that they were getting from tax money would be eliminated so you would in theory be able to lower taxes. This however veers into should we have a minimum wage.\n\nIf you have research you would like to link me to I will be happy to read it in but in the interest of keeping on topic I don't want to continue this thread."}, {"id": "2rhve5", "body": "Note: While this general argument may apply to other countries points made below will be specific to the point of view of the United States.\n\nRecently it's been in the news that many states have increased minimum wages this year without action from the federal government. In case one is not familiar currently the minimum wage is passed into passed as an hourly figure into law. To update the figure it requires another law to amend the older one. The Federal Government sets a minimum wage which is a universal minimum for all businesses operating within the United States. Individual states may opt to raise the minimum wage above that level if they wish.\n\nHard coding the minimum wage into law in this way is inefficient and usually damaging to most parties involved. Political parties and politicians suffer because it distracts them from working on other issues which may be more important, forcing them to make what should be trivial adjustments and sets up a perpetually recurring fight. Depending on which party has control of the house, senate, and white house it may be impossible to get any legislation through congress or the state level of government for years at a time. To get the minimum wage raised requires a large amount of political capital because it is such a controversial issue. Raising the minimum wage is a zero sum game with one of the two parties benefiting from action or lack of it. Due to this it is a toxic subject to breech in congress.\n\nWorkers suffer from the fighting in congress because for long periods of time they experience either low or no wage increases meaning that for many years their income does not keep track with the rate of inflation. Because of this they may not be able to buy the things they need with their paycheck thus defeating the point of minimum wage.\n\nBusinesses suffer because they have uncertainty over their labor costs from the fighting. While they may get savings due to declining wages relative to purchasing power in the long term they have to worry about not only the demands of the labor market but also the uncertainty of who will win a given election and what the political priorities of the newly elected majority will be. This creates uncertainty and may cause employers to delay hiring decisions and postpone growth.\n\nIn short there aren't many people who truly win with the way we currently adjust minimum wage. One of the key problems with the current system is we don't give bureaucrats the authority to do their job. It is the ultimate in micromanagement literally requiring an act of congress to do anything. This is a systemic issue in almost all areas of the federal government but it's especially acute here. At it's core congress should only focus on the big picture. It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.\n\n**The Cost of Labor**\n\nMinimum wage is a CMV in and of itself and has been discussed in many other threads on this sub in the past. **I don't want people to argue about whether or not there should be a minimum wage in this thread or the specific figure that the minimum wage should be.** The assumptions and limitations here are to limit what would invariably be off topic debates, I want to discuss this specific issue and not a broader one. Let's just go with the assumption that the existence of a minimum wage is a given and getting rid of it is not an option.\n\nThe greatest benefit to a minimum wage is that if someone is able to get a job and get enough hours to work full time they will have enough money that to support themselves without having to rely on public assistance. At the risk of being overly simplistic the key idea is that there is a given minimum amount of money that a person must spend every month to stay alive. There is a higher amount of money that a person must spend to have what society would consider an acceptable standard of living. If someone does not have the money to pay these costs then they will either eventually die and/or live in substandard conditions unless an outside force intervenes. Let's also assume that a person has no way of getting resources other than buying them at fair market value and can't grow, steal, beg, or barter for them.\n\nIf the we as a society decide that we should not let people die for lack of money, then the only way for them to get the resources they need is for everyone else who has money to pay a portion of their earnings in taxes. The taxes are then used to purchase these resources for the individuals that don't have the ability to buy them for themselves.\n\nIf you allow businesses to pay people less than what it costs for one person to afford these resources then you are shifting the cost of supporting that person from the owners of the business to everybody in society. This is unfair because the business is the one that is benefiting from the labor of this individual yet they are not paying market value for it. As such it should be able to establish that the amount of money necessary for self-sufficiency is the basic cost of human capital.\n\nThis makes more sense when you think of labor in the same way you would think of other commodities. If you were to take a crop such as coffee and allow farmers to lease or buy land at below market value then the price of coffee wouldn't be accurate. I don't think most people would think it would be fair to expect other people to pay for the farmer's land.\n\n**The Proposed Solution**\n\nWe have hopefully established that there is a basic cost for human capital. To calculate what the cost is for human labor all one would need to do is add up the costs necessary to buy the basic resources every year and then divide by the number of given working hours in a year. As above I would like to request that people not argue about the exact definitions of what should be included in the definition of necessary resources and how many hours is fair to work in a week, those are all debates for other CMVs.\n\nThis should theoretically be very easy but we here we run into another problem with the minimum wage. Not all areas have equal costs of living and thus the cost of necessary resources is dependant entirely on where you are located and what the lowest cost for those goods in that area is. This changes on not only a city by city basis but also on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis within a city. You could have millions of different answers for minimum wages dependant on many different factors.\n\nTo simplify this we could group similar areas into different regions and run this calculation for each. This approach would make more sense for businesses because they could make more efficient decisions about where they should hire labor from based on the cost of living. For higher paying jobs they already do this, but this could see an explosion of jobs in low cost areas due to the low minimum wage. One of the core principles of economics is that incentives matter. If costs aren't accurate then the decisions that companies make will be biased and it will result in a more inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nThe next thing you would need to address is how do you get the data on the cost of living. For the most part we are already collecting this data for the consumer price index. The CPI would not be useful for this however because it includes data on all things in the economy, not just the basic resources needed to maintain life. To get this right you would need to create a new price index specifically for the minimum wage.\n\nAdditionally prices constantly change, that is the reason for automatic updates to the minimum wage to begin with. If you had the data you could update the minimum wage as frequently as desired. Practically speaking however, changing the minimum wage frequently would create a compliance nightmare for businesses and regulators. To reduce this burden making it so the minimum only adjusts on longer timescales is more beneficial. The best approach here is likely to update the minimum wage on an annual basis.\n\nTo offset variations in market prices and within regions as well as the risk of having incomplete or faulty data it would only make sense that the minimum wage has some sort of padding on top of it as a margin of error. As an initial estimate I would assume this margin of error would somewhere between 1.5% and 7%, because the rates of inflation are usually between 2%-3% within a given calendar year. However the exact number of course could be adjusted based on data and you would need to determine how variable prices and the commonality of errors to find the optimum value. Developing a formula would allow you to make minimum wages dynamically adjust based on the previous year's volatility or specific conditions in a certain region. When calculating margins of error it would likely be better to err on the side of a higher wage than a lower one.\n\n(**tl;dr**) What you'd end up with is:\n\nMinimum Hourly Wage = ( Regional Minimum Wage Price Index for Year / Full Time Working Hours per Year ) * ( 1 + Padding Margin Percentage )\n\n**Previous attempts at this idea**\n\nIn the 1970s during the period of double digit inflation rates this idea was floated by the Democrat party and made significant headway but received substantial opposition because of the high interest rates and the fear that these would remain for a long period of time.\n\nEdit: /u/srak has pointed out that this has existed in Belgium since 1919.\n\nFeel free to point out any problems you see in the idea of the minimum cost of human capital since this is essential to the promise that the wages should automatically adjust. Without that assumption everything else doesn't make any sense. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Deflation actually raises real wages and decreases the cost of living which increases the standard of living for poor people and the middle class. Let prices (including the price of labor) be set by the market, you know, supply and demand."}, {"id": "cngznqg", "body": "&gt; Almost all of your entire post was spent making the case for a minimum wage, and you tell us you don't want us to respond to that?\n\nYes because search showed this issue has been discussed [at length on this sub before](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/income#wiki_minimum_wage). While I haven't read all of the other CMVs regarding minimum wage I don't think anything expressed here is by any means revolutionary. This topic however according to the search feature has not been posted before.\n\nThe answer to the question I am searching to is \"Should minimum wages adjust automatically?\". This assumes that minimum wages are a reality and at they are here to stay, which is a pretty safe assumption. The only reason I explain the logic behind my thinking is to give an explanation of how I get the numbers rather than just pulling it out of the air. The first section of the post is about the problem with the current system, the second is about a justification for the cost of minimum wage, and the third is how to calculate it based on that cost.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about the opposing side, it's that I don't want to rehash stuff over and over again. If you are interested go checkout the other CMVs.\n\n&gt;  It is a barrier to entry for youth and low skilled workers,\n\nIt is, however youth workers should likely be in school anyways instead of working. Low skilled workers should probably be off fixing the first two words in the description. It doesn't make sense to change or make an exception just for teens who are dependants. Nor should we set the minimum wage higher to allow people to support a family based on it. You have to figure the most common case which I'm guessing is single young low skilled workers.\n\n&gt; I reject the idea that if someone chooses to buy someone elses labor that was offered to them freely and voluntarily that they should now be responsible for all of that persons spending habits and cost of living.\n\nSo the person should be on welfare why they are working for you and we should pay for that person's cost of living so you can get cheap wages? This does not seem fair.\n\nPeople have a limited number of hours available to them in the day. Low income people are also usually more vulnerable because they are uneducated and may feel powerless and not have the slightest clue on how to engage in salary negotiations. If they agree to work for a wage that won't afford them a given minimum expenses then they are doing society at large disservice by working because we have to support them. They would likely be better off being unemployed and instead using the time to participate in a job training and do job searches.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily be against allowing workers to work part time (say up to 20 hours a week) for below the minimum wage for all jobs. The problem with this however is you would encourage employers to lay off full time minimum wage employees and replace them entirely with part time workers. I think the only way you could do this is you used the same criteria as immigration laws where you must demonstrate that there are no full time workers available to fill the position or had a similar restriction.\n\n&gt; If you want to help poor people, you should be against inflationary monetary policy. Deflation actually raises real wages and decreases the cost of living which increases the standard of living for poor people and the middle class. \n\nThe greatest and longest period of deflation the United States has ever had was the Great Depression. We saw how much that helped the poor and middle class. Inflation helps encourage spending by giving people fear that their money will be less in the future than it is now, so it is better to buy now than later. Deflation does the opposite, people don't want to spend money because they know it will be worth more in the future.\n\nIt might be good for the middle class but it is bad for businesses, especially small businesses which are the primary employers of people in the US economy. This causes them to engage in layoffs which will eventually hurt the middle class and the poor."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2rh4rz", "body": "One of the most common interpertations of Romeo and Juliet is that it's a satire of how young people act.

Rather,  the main theme of the story is about the importance of forgiveness.  My argument relies heavily on another Shakespeare play,  the Tempest.  \n\nIn the Tempest,  two major characters are Ferdinand, and Miranda.  They're essentially the Romeo and Juliet of their play.  Although the rivalry between their families is one-sided,  Miranda's father, Propsero, hate's Ferdinand's father because Ferdinand's father had wronged Prospero in the past.  In the Tempest,  two teens also meet and fall in love very quickly.    Ferdinand and Miranda meet each other,  fall in love,  and decide to get married all in the span of an afternoon,  however,  they have a happy ending,  while Romeo and Juliet die.  \n\nIt has been a full year since I was in an English class,  but I remember in my class,  my professor said that most of Shakespeare\u2019s plays follow what's called \"the rule of time\".

For this reason,  I don't believe the amount of time that passed in the play is evidence that R&amp;J is satire. \n\nIf we're going to look at the relationships of the characters through the eyes of a cynic the relationship between Ferdinand and Miranda is even more rash and impulsive than the relationship between Romeo and Juliet.  Early on in the play,  it's revealed that Ferdinand and Prospero are the only human men Miranda has ever seen in her life, \u201cThis, / Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first /  That e'er I sigh'd for\u201d.  Also,  immediately after they meet,  before they've even kissed,  Ferdinand agrees to become a slave to win Prospero's favour.  If Shakespeare did want to  mock irrational decisions made by teens,  then the Tempest would have been a better opportunity than Romeo and Juliet.\n\nSo,  why did Romeo and Juliet\u2019s relationship fail and why did Ferdinand and Miranda's relationship prosper?  Romeo and Juleit's families were unable to forgive each other until after the two teens died.  The families of Ferdinand and Miranda were able to reconcile before anyone died.  Prospero is actually put in the position to kill Ferdinand's father after taking him prisoner.

Ferdinand and Miranda meet each other,  fall in love,  and decide to get married all in the span of an afternoon,  however,  they have a happy ending,  while Romeo and Juliet die.  \n\nIt has been a full year since I was in an English class,  but I remember in my class,  my professor said that most of Shakespeare\u2019s plays follow what's called \"the rule of time\".  The rule of time states that all the events in the play should happen in a relatively short timespan.  From what I can remember, most of Shakespeare\u2019s plays follow this,  with Merchant of Venice being one of the few exceptions.   For this reason,  I don't believe the amount of time that passed in the play is evidence that R&amp;J is satire. \n\nIf we're going to look at the relationships of the characters through the eyes of a cynic the relationship between Ferdinand and Miranda is even more rash and impulsive than the relationship between Romeo and Juliet.  Early on in the play,  it's revealed that Ferdinand and Prospero are the only human men Miranda has ever seen in her life, \u201cThis, / Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first /  That e'er I sigh'd for\u201d.  Also,  immediately after they meet,  before they've even kissed,  Ferdinand agrees to become a slave to win Prospero's favour.  If Shakespeare did want to  mock irrational decisions made by teens,  then the Tempest would have been a better opportunity than Romeo and Juliet.\n\nSo,  why did Romeo and Juliet\u2019s relationship fail and why did Ferdinand and Miranda's relationship prosper?  Romeo and Juleit's families were unable to forgive each other until after the two teens died.  The families of Ferdinand and Miranda were able to reconcile before anyone died.  Prospero is actually put in the position to kill Ferdinand's father after taking him prisoner.   Rather than murdering Ferdinand's father,  Prospero chooses to forgive him even though he still hates what Ferdinand's father did to him.\n\n\u201cThough with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick,\n\nYet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury\n\nDo I take part. **The rarer action is**\n\n**In virtue than in vengeance**. They being penitent,\n\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\n\nNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel.\n\nMy charms I\u2019ll break, their senses I\u2019ll restore,\n\nAnd they shall be themselves.\u201c\n\nBecause the cycle of vengence is broke in the Tempest,  Miranda and Ferdinand get a happy ending. \n\nThe Capulets and the Montagues are not able to reconcile until the deaths of Romeo and Juliet have occurred.   During the masquerade Tybalt realizes that Romeo has attended the party,  even though members of house Montague are banned from attending.  Tybalt wishes to kill Romeo for this,  but Lord Capulet stops him as Romeo isn't a bad guy,   \u201cAnd, to say truth, Verona brags of him\n / To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:\u201d.  Tybalt however,  instead of forgiving Romeo for attending a party without an invitation,  decides to let his hatred for Romeo fester,  treating Romeo's actions as a personal insult. \u201cI will withdraw: but this intrusion shall / Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.\u201d.  Tybalt and Romeo would later have an altercation after Romeo and Juliet get married.  Tyblat is unaware of this marriage and still hates Romeo,  while Romeo refuses to fight \u201c\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love: / And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender / As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.\u201d.  This inability to forgive each other is what leads to the deaths of numerous characteres.  \n\nThe ending to Romeo and Juliet is very bitter-sweet,  the two teens are dead,  but it was their death that had caused the vendetta to stop.  The deaths of Romeo and Juliet causes  the Capulets and Montagues finally reconcile,  after seeing what their hatred did to their families, and the family of the Prince. \u201cWhere be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!/ See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, / That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. / And I for winking at your discords too / Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd\u201d.   The deaths that occurred in the play were a result of the inability to forgive,  and the ending of the play is the characters realizing that. \n\n\nEdit: It has beeb just about three hours since I posted this, and nobody has responded. I'm going to bed,  I'll look at any responses tomorrow after my first class\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

What this has led to is a police culture of being able to take a human life at the first sign that an officer's life is in danger, even remotely. \n\nIf a person is actually committed to being a benevolent protector of the public, he or she should be willing to take a greater personal risk in being that protector. It is my view that many officers should be disarmed of the ability to use lethal force - guns should only be carried under circumstances in which there is an actual chance of having to draw them in a fight for one's life i.e. police are going after a known dangerous individual. \n\nThis would undoubtedly lead to an increase in officers not being able to brandish a lethal weapon in situations where they previously would have. Some police officers would die where they wouldn't have before. But many fewer unnecessary civilian deaths would occur. In my opinion, cops being lethally armed and authorized to take lethal action whenever they feel threatened is not worth the cost we have been witnessing where many avoidable civilian deaths occur.\n\nI think it is somewhat tragic that carrying a gun is what in many ways defines what an American police officer is - someone with the ability to kill at any time should they feel it is necessary. In an ideal world where our culture did not dictate that police carry guns I think it would be great if every morning individual officers made a reasonable choice as to whether or not they would need a gun that day for whatever reason. Unfortunately this culture could not exist in America today.\n\nObviously in place of guns I would have increased use of tazers, not just the short-range handheld kind but also the adapted shotgun models that reach a range similar to that of a gun. Rubber bullets would also be acceptable. \n\nMy main point is that cops should be taking a greater personal risk in serving the public as our current system of valuing police life above the citizenry is what has led to such endemic unnecessary police violence.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

What this has led to is a police culture of being able to take a human life at the first sign that an officer's life is in danger, even remotely. \n\nSource? What is the basis for making that connection? What makes you think police officers think their lives are more important than the civilians they serve? What makes you think that culture exists? Do you know any cops? \n\n&gt; he or she should be willing to take a greater personal risk in being that protector.\n\nAnd they are. They are at an effectively infinite greater personal risk than you or I *with* their guns. \n\n&gt; guns should only be carried under circumstances in which there is an actual chance of having to draw them in a fight for one's life\n\nThere is *always* an actual chance of needing to draw them in a fight for one's life. Literally anyone could be concealing a weapon at any time. \n\n&gt; many fewer unnecessary civilian deaths would occur. \n \nSource? Would unnecessary civilian deaths really occur less, or would the complete toothlessness of law enforcement lead to an increase in violent crime? \n\n&gt;In an ideal world where our culture did not dictate that police carry guns ... Unfortunately this culture could not exist in America today.\n\nSo are you talking about policy or culture? Either way, the phrase \"in an ideal world\" almost always precedes a moot point. \n\n&gt; in place of guns I would have increased use of tazers ... Rubber bullets would also be acceptable. \n\nJust a point of clarity, rubber bullets are intended for crowd dispersal, not individual subdual. There's still a good chance that getting hit directly with a rubber bullet could kill or maim someone. From wiki:\n\n*\"In a study of injuries in 90 patients injured by rubber bullets, one died, 17 suffered permanent disabilities or deformities and 41 required hospital treatment after being fired upon with rubber bullets.\"*\n\nPresumably those injured in that study were hit with rubber bullets in a riot control situation. What typically happens in this scenario is that the bullets are fired at the ground, then bounce up and hit people in the crowd at an oblique angle and a reduced speed. This works because in a crowd, the bullet is likely to hit *somebody*, regardless of the angle. There is no such guarantee with an individual suspect. That's why police officers are taught to aim for center-of-mass when subduing a target, because it's the easiest way to actually hit your target and not send a stray bullet sailing off towards god knows what, and that center-mass training isn't going to change. \n\nI agree that more nonlethal options should be explored, and the R+D resources are definitely there to develop them, but rubber bullets are probably not the answer. \n\n***\n\nI'd also like to take this moment to make an argument that I think had been entirely under-represented in this most recent public dialogue about police violence. This applies mostly to the Garner case. \n\nWe live in a world with guns. I don't like that. I wish guns didn't exist. A lot of people feel like I do, and a lot don't. But that's irrelevant. Guns exist, and people have them. People will continue to have them. If they're made illegal, the people who have them will be criminals. \n\nThe conclusion we have come to as a society is that armed police forces are necessary for our safety. This is essentially a premise of the American experience. \n\nWhat no one seems to be talking about is the fact that we send these armed people to enforce stupid, unjust laws. The cigarette taxes in New York are ridiculous, unjust, an affront to the dignity and personal liberty of smokers, and they create a black market which puts armed police at odds with everyday citizens trying to make a buck. If we didn't have our cops enforcing stupid, low-level laws, many of which should never have been in place to begin with, we would reduce police violence without reducing their capacity to protect us. \n\nDitto for the war on drugs. We accept as a simple matter of statistics that black men are enormously more likely to be victims of police violence than any other group, and it's plain that the war on drugs is the most transparently racist body of law in place in this country. It takes fathers away from countless children, turns black neighborhoods into breeding grounds for crime, and provides illegal income to gangs. The link between these laws and the inordinately high rates of interaction between police and black communities is crystal clear. Why are we not in the streets by the hundred thousand screaming to have this awful program torn out by the roots? \n\nFor my part I think it's because it requires a few seconds of thought to see the connection, whereas a cop shooting a kid --even a kid who was attacking him-- makes an impression immediately. \n\nTL;DR Police violence is the symptom. Unjust laws are the problem. No one is protesting the problem because it's not dramatic and doesn't make national news.

Just because that is over does not mean that we should get rid of an amendment there for the means of protection against government, especially in this day and age where the government has the power and weaponry it does vs what civilians may have. As an outsider, I'm sure you can see the power trip the US government has...now imagine the people themselves were to suffer from this within the country itself. 2A is there to ensure the people have a means to fight against those with power...and who is trying to continually take those rights away? The same people who have more power and the ones we don't want having too much power. See the issue there?\n\nNow let's look at the crime aspect. The main focus on the issue of \"gun crime\" is the violence aspect. People can become violent if they so choose to. If they have a weapon, they can do a lot of harm. Now mind you anything can be a weapon. A firearm just happens to be most effective, but there are plenty of murders and robberies commuted with weapons other than guns. Studies from the CDC and FBI have shown that guns are not as big of an issue as the media portrays it to be. When it comes to violent crime, guns do not hold the majority. People just like to ignore this fact.\n\nOn the news all you hear is \"gun crime, murder, robbery, etc\" but those are the stories that catch viewers eyes, thus they watch, see commercials which fund the news station, more views = more money from ad revenue...the media is a business and people at the head of those businesses can choose to show what they want to try and change the views of others. If you own a news media and don't like guns, will you show pro-gun stories? No. Will you show just the opposite? Definitely. That is where the problem lies in making it seem like a bigger deal than it is, thus the projection that the country has a gun problem. \n\nCrime is the true problem, not the tool that is involved. Why is \"gun crime/violence\" the issue? Shouldn't all crime and violence seem  to be equally as bad. Let's say someone is shot to death and another is stabbed to death...why focus more on the tool used than the fact a person was killed?\n\nNow do bear in mind, we are different people from different places with different histories. What may work over there may not work for us, vice versa. Let's compare this to illegal immigration...we have far more guns than illegal immigrants, yet many have decided it's too late to find out who is legal and who isn't. Now try that with the hundreds of millions of guns in the US. It's damn near impossible to efficiently regulate at this point. Yes laws can be passed but places such as Chicago have shown that a gun ban does not stop crime committed with a gun. \n\nIn most of Europe's case, guns were heavily restricted from the get go, this regulation is easier over there. At this point the US needs to try to prevent crime by improving the economic status of the country to reduce the incentive for certain crime, as well as deter criminals with stricter punishments. We did it when car jackings blew up decades ago...now if you carjack someone, you go to federal prison. Federal prison (from my understanding) has whats known as \"hard time\". Whatever sentence you are given is final. No good behavior leniency, no parole...you get served 25 years, you stay 25 years, period. I also think prisoners have way too much freedom thus many do not take prison so seriously. If prison was simply solitary confinement for the whole sentence, more would fear going, and could deter crime from happening due to fear of a true punishment. None of this slap on the wrist garbage. These people have not proven themselves fit to be among society, why keep releasing them? This is where our crime problem continues, repeat offenders who were not punished enough to learn not to do it again.

Mind you, a gun is not the only weapon out there and crime has little to do with guns and is based around social and economic issues, not the tool used for crime.\n"}, {"id": "cnih0lz", "body": "Again i point to Europe and ask you why its citizens are safe ( at least as safe as americans) with out all needing to be armed"}, {"id": "cnih0lz", "body": "Again i point to Europe and ask you why its citizens are safe ( at least as safe as americans) with out all needing to be armed"}, {"id": "cnjrrbq", "body": "That question is really difficult to answer but has little to do with the level of guns per capita or the availability of firearms. \n\nThe Czech republic has the most liberal firearm laws in Europe. Firearms license are shall issue, and anyone from a Euro-zone or NATO nation can get a firearm with a license without difficulty. Citizens are allowed to carry concealed weapons. \n\nYet, crime rate with firearms is very, very low. And the intentional homicide rate per 100,000 citizens is 1.0, well below the European average of 3.0, and quite comparable to the rate of Poland (1.2) which has the most restrictive firearms laws in Europe. \n"}, {"id": "cnih0lz", "body": "Again i point to Europe and ask you why its citizens are safe ( at least as safe as americans) with out all needing to be armed"}, {"id": "cnipwpw", "body": "Well for one, the US isn't some 3rd world country. The U.S. Is generally considered safe. Now, the point of needing firearms to be safe is a commonly misunderstood point by many. To put it this way, a firearm does not keep you safe. It is mind set and situational awareness and precautionary practices that keep you safe (not going anywhere dangerous, locking your doors at night, not answering the door to someone you do not know, not being alone when out at night, staying in well lit and populated areas, etc). \n\nWith all those and many more practices in mind, you can live a safe life. Now with that said, how many times on the news do you hear a witness to a crime say \"I didn't think something like that could happen in a place like this\"? There is no populated place on this earth that is crime free as people cause crime and people are everywhere. Among the entirety of crime that could happen, violent crime is among a percentage of said crime. Violent criminals can come singular, as a group, and come armed with many types of weapons or even their fists and feet.  No matter how safe you try to be, you can still become a victim of violent crime, which is the point where a weapon can keep you safe by giving you a plan B to trying to live your life.\n\nGoing back to what I said in a previous post about firearms already being heavily prevalent in the U.S., getting rid of them will be difficult even if they were outright banned. Since criminals can get ahold of these firearms, they sometimes commit violent crime with them. Now let's take gang on gang violence out of the equation and look at crime they commit on individuals. Since it is likely they will be armed when commuting a violent crime, what is the best way to defend yourself with against them? A weapon of your own. Now there are varying degrees of weapons you can carry, but the most common and effective is the typical hand gun. When your life is put at risk, you should do all you can to survive.\n\nI have been involved in 2 situations where my firearm has had to come out...one being a robbery attempt, to which he ran away when he saw I also had a gun, and another where all a group of people (12) wanted to do nothing more than harm me because they got evicted and placed the blame on me because I was the only one around. To focus on the second mentioned situation, they came at me with blunt weapons. If they caught up to me, one strike to the head with that crow bar could have killed me. The firearm I presented caused a group of 12 violent people to be at disadvantage of one person. Everybody went home that day because they felt furthering their attack would cause me to shoot, and they wanted to live more than they wanted to hurt me. In that situation, pepper spray, a stun gun, or a blunt weapon of my own would not have saved me. My firearm on the other hand did keep me safe. Not all attacks will happen like that, bunt bear in mind criminals like to take advantage of the weak and attack in groups as you may have seen from various robberies caught on film.\n\nNow as preciously stated, firearms are easier for criminals to obtain in the US, thus they will commonly, but not always, use them. In nations where firearms where restricted that is less so the case. Can they get ahold of them, yes, is it easy? Well that depends. Mind you, there are some easy to make firearms...crude yet effective for the criminals task. As stated in my situation against those 12, criminals can and tend to attack in groups. A weapon that does not put you at an advantage against a group means they will likely win. Bear in mind, not all criminals per coming a violent act will let you live. A relative of mine faced that exact issue. \n\nTo finish, Europe still has a large amount of violent crime. Since firearms are not as common there, you do not see as many guns used in crime than in U.S., where as many criminals use guns here. Having a gun of your own puts you on an equal playing field when it comes to surviving. Let's say a large and strong person breaks into the home of a small physically weak person with intent to do harm such as a former spouse seeking revenge, or a home invasion rape scenario...that smaller person can now effectively take down the larger attacker where as a weapon requiring physical strength would have been of no advantage to the weaker person. Now let's take my girlfriend for example. Smaller, weaker, cannot physically take on a larger and stronger attacker, she has asthma thus cannot use pepper spray or run away without high risk of breathing problems. She practices situational awareness and over all safety to avoid a situation where her life is at risk, and if that fails, her 9mm is there as her last resort.

Are you looking at the big picture?\n\n\nWe live in a world where there is a strong front against police. While most wouldn't dare, some people don't care and will try to attack a police officer. Just like the military, the cops are reminded frequently that we are common targets (including our families and other close associates). Knowing this, why would a half decent-minded person willingly put on his/her uniform, but no holster?\n\n\nA much better and more plausible solution would be to focus on training and discipline. Punish bad behavior and make it an example. Not sure about the police, but in most situations the military is ironically not trained to \"shoot to kill\" in most circumstances. A shot to the leg, foot, or arm works just as well. The goal is to incapacitate and capture, not to kill. On an insensitive note, death brings a lot of paperwork.\n\n\nBut really, let's be honest with ourselves: [some police officers suck](http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/dashcam-shows-cops-shooting-an-unarmed-man-333655619609). And due to our very biased media, we're only shown the instances in which they suck the most. No one (not even my local news station) would report a cop saving a homeless puppy, or helping a little girl with her math homework.

Both shots failed (one missed and the other hit and had no effect). The UK stopped trials with them soon after and went back to the standard taser because it worked better (reliability, performance, effectiveness and safety were mentioned). Rubber bullets are also possible (especially against rioters) but still are less effective than tasers. \n\nOverall against unarmed people or against people armed with melee weapons the police could use tasers or rubber bullets or water cannons but against someone armed with a gun then the best solution is the police armed with a gun.   \n\nSource http://news.sky.com/story/1116684/taser-shotgun-tests-scrapped-by-home-office"}, {"id": "2rgszm", "body": "The stated mission of police is to \"serve and protect\" the people, and obviously from what we've seen recently in the news this mission is being strayed from.\n\nI am against the idea that police should be especially respected and revered as it contributes to their own idea that their lives matter more than those of the citizenry.

Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame. \n\n(3) Enjoying the moment is possible, but doesn't make life have a point.

Most of them will never fully utilize their fitness in a meaningful way. In the long run, their progress will definitely be lost because their bodies will eventually fail, and they will die. Yet, knowing they can't keep their fitness in a single lifetime (let alone eternity), they strive to work out and build themselves. Why is that? \n\n&gt;Every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home\n\n~Matsuo Basho\n\nAs mortal beings, we are relatively short-sighted. But, maybe that isn't a depressing idea. Maybe it's a great thing. Maybe it's beautiful that we can find so much meaning, so many experiences and so much emotion in such a short time frame, even if none of it lasts. Individually, we'll live and die and the universe won't even have had a chance to blink. And yet, maybe we'll get to have lived pretty well here.

Instead we take pleasure from silly things like a 2 minute song that gets stuck in our head, or a person that says 'have a nice day', and that gives us the motivation to carry on and be productive, contributing to humankind's future advancement. We are part of the largest team effort in the world, whether we know it or not every positive action we make is working towards building a better world for future generations, it could be 2000 actions from now where something important happened, but you could unwittingly be the start of that 2000 action chain that leads to greatness with something as simple as a hello.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnfqwin", "body": "All your points seem to be on quite a selfish level (no offense).

I'm sure you've seen the image of our solar system where the Earth is just a pixel on the screen, life only exists on that one pixel, the rest of the solar system is barren nothingness, spread every human out across our solar system and we could all comfortably live in our own floating space mansions with acres of garden because there are so few of us compared to the vast universe we live in. Hell the stars far outnumber us yet all of us humans have the potential to do far more in our lifetime than a random star will ever have in it's thousands of years of life. \n\nEven if you choose not to have a child you could still influence someone's life, if you show malice to people maybe you drive a man to depression. Show him compassion maybe he decides there is good in the world and he goes on to contribute to science or to become a great musician that inspires thousands of others, or maybe he just becomes a great father that raises a great kid that goes on to do great things. \n\nHundreds of people you show compassion to probably won't even register it, but that doesn't matter, if even one person takes on board a good action that you've done and becomes a better person for it (and trust me, even if you don't ever know about it, it will happen) then you have contributed to humanity's future advancement and possible immortality. We won't get to see it but does that really matter? We weren't made to live forever even if we could be in the future, we were made to take joy from the little things and I honestly believe that is an evolutionary trait. If we didn't take joy in the little things then humanity long ago would have said 'what's the point?' given up, and died out. Instead we take pleasure from silly things like a 2 minute song that gets stuck in our head, or a person that says 'have a nice day', and that gives us the motivation to carry on and be productive, contributing to humankind's future advancement. We are part of the largest team effort in the world, whether we know it or not every positive action we make is working towards building a better world for future generations, it could be 2000 actions from now where something important happened, but you could unwittingly be the start of that 2000 action chain that leads to greatness with something as simple as a hello.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnfrdxb", "body": "Life is lived from the perspective of the person living it.

And I would like to quote Laplace by saying, \"I had no need of that [god] hypothesis\" to say so. I have not only learned about how it works, i've actually made models describing tiny pieces of it. And the insights they have gained me go far beyond what i observed in my plots, or my equations, or even my explanations. Being immersed in science and the mathematical and computer modeling of nature, and in particular of life, have given me a very special outlook on it. An outlook i try to share with anyone who cares to listen.\n\nI slowly built up this outlook by taking physical chemistry 1  and 2 (thermodynamics and kinetics), genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, metabolic biochemistry and learning/teaching myself statistical mechanics and mathematical physics and dynamical systems.\n\nI realised quite some time ago that life is just probability. Life is a whole bunch of different systems working because of two things: sheer numbers and affinity. Which become probabilities. That's all it is.\n\nLife is a fight against equilibrium. One system pushes in one direction, which causes another to push back in a feedback loop. If you look at it closely, there is no conscious thought, just probability. Item A is created by item B and destroyed by item C. So the more there is of B, the more we create of A; while the more there is of C, the more we destroy A. Each interaction (creation or annihilation) has its associated energy, which sort of 'weights' the probability of an event. It may be that destruction of A by C is so favourable that for every C to destroy A, you'd need 100 B's just to make up the loss in A's. Now imagine this using all the alphabets on earth and make it non-linear (not always in the same proportion), add feedback loops at various stages and cross link interactions from all over the map. This is life.\n\nWe're also organic computers. Our brains actually work just like traditional computers, only we don't use electrons. We use ions--both positive and negative--and molecules to relay messages from neuron to neuron. But we also use different types of positive and negative ions and molecules, Ca^2+ , K^+ , Na^+ , glutamate, dopamine, serotonine, GABA and many more. And it's all about effectively dispersing energy in different ways.\n\nI already mentioned there is no conscious process involved in any of this equilibration interplay. But what makes life truly precious is that it is more than the sum of its parts. \n\nI have seen this in my short exposure to science, and the research i did over the summer. Especially the research i did during the summer. It was on mathematically and computationally modelling interacting [kinesin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesin) movements along [microtubules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule). The simulation was a couple of *very* simple movement rules, with interaction energies (think of the weights i talked about in the section about items A, B and C earlier) set up in a realistic way. There were also entrance and exit parameters. This very simple abstraction of a biological 1D (1 dimension) system (movement is only in one axis, and in this case only 1 direction) presented very weird behaviours. I also helped develop a mathematical theory to approximate these findings, and that was *extremely hard*, and not completely right. This deceptively simple system gave me further evidence that life is fucking precious. But i didn't stop there. I made more codes (but not more theories) for increasingly complex systems, which kept being 1D but presented other interactions, and some the possibility of movement in the backwards direction. They all behaved in different and increasingly more complex ways, presenting strange shapes and behaviours, all in 1 dimension. Yet they are still highly simplified abstractions of a tiny little part of a huge whole we call life.\n\nAs my career as a scientist moves forward, as i learn more about the simulation of nature via mathematics and programming, i confirm what i have thought for as long as i remember having the power of thought. That nature is fucking awesome, weird, complicated, exciting, scary, or whatever adjective you may ascribe to it; but most of all, that its crowning jewel--life--is precious. Precious not because it was created by a god, which has been proven to not have been necessary by the de-novo and 'environmental' (from scratch) synthesis of aminoacids, lipids, liposomes, XNAs, and self-assembling molecules in-lab and the discovery of aminoacids, lipids, and complex organic molecules in space. Precious not because i, or anybody else says so. But precious because of how unlikely, delicate and mind-boggingly complex it all is, more than anything else out there, because it actually involves or interacts with everything else out there."}, {"id": "2rgs7o", "body": "*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post.

It matters to OTHERS how old you are when you die. If you were to drop dead now, your parents (assuming they are alive), your friends, and those close to you in general will be pained by this.

This is a short list of people mixing those some alive today and some dead. But they all had a huge impact on us today. They are all remembered. And for a very long time, they will all be remembered. Yes, eventually the DNA you pass to your descendents will be so diluted it will be unrecognizable. But that does not mean that the contributions you made to others' lives have all been meaningless.\n\nYou won't know what you did for others, but they will know what you did for them. Think about a lesson a dead loved one taught you. Do you REALLY think it is meaningless because that person does not know how it impacted you?\n\n&gt;  Assuming there is no afterlife, life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die. Death is the great eraser.\n\nI think that if we consider a worldview in which there is no afterlife (a worldview which I do share with you), it makes life itself more meaningful. Imagine for a second that there IS an eternal afterlife. Human average lifespan is approximately 80 years. Compared to ETERNITY, that is nothing. Imagine an electron located at the center of the universe. Every second, that electron moves the distance of one electron towards one \"edge\" of the universe (which is expanding). That electron's goal is to reach one end of the universe and then turn around and go to the opposite edge. Assuming expansion is faster than size of one electron per second, that is eternity. That is how long it will take to complete that cycle. It does not end. Any period of time you consider is as meaningful as one yoctosecond (10^-24) when there is an eternity. When we have such limited time to live and be with our loved ones, everything we do is meaningful. Every second we do not love our loved ones is a waste.\n\nThink about what is needed for an afterlife view, ESPECIALLY with the Judeo-Christian view: that sort of worldview says there is love more important than the love that your REAL friends and your REAL family, who choose to spend their limited time with you. Those who love you here in this life will die. Yes. But the limited time you have to love your family and friends is more than enough. \n\nIf we are looking from the religious viewpoint on a meaning of life then yes, in a sense an atheistic view of life does not have an overall meaning. But you can give it your own meaning. You said in a different comment that you want the moments with your girlfriend and with reddit to last forever. It won't, but you sure as fuck can make all the best of the time you DO have. Everyone wants something impossible at some point. But as nonreligious people (in this case I just include you and me, but I suppose others can feel this way as well), we have to settle for what we have, or perhaps for what we CAN have.

It is comparable to that, too. \n\nIt makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die. Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness. Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing. To me, it is as if my life had never happened. \n\nI'll put it another way. Imagine the time before you were born. Have you remembered it yet? Of course not. You didn't exist. This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth. When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness, and I return to it permanently. I might as well have never lived. \n\nTo anticipate a few responses:\n\n(1) Helping others doesn't matter. They will die too. And then their descendants will die, on and on and on, until eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death. Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me, assuming they all die, then my life is still pointless and meaningless. For I will be dead and won't know what I did, and once they die, they won't know either. \n\n(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me \"immortal.\" I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness. Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame. \n\n(3) Enjoying the moment is possible, but doesn't make life have a point. For once I die, all memories and all point is gone. \n\nPlease change my view from this depressing sentiment.
