Anscombe argued that many of the mistakes in modern ethics are due to philosophers attempting to find a foundation for the stark \"either-or\" conception of morality that we got from Christianity, and that we should return to the more fine grained virtue ethics of the Greeks.

It was around 2004 and I was young and I had read Richard Clarke's book *Against All Enemies* and come out of it hating George W. Bush. I still have very strong negative opinions of the man and think history will judge him as one of our worst presidents. I was perfectly primed to believe Loose Change when I saw it. I say this not because you should care what my personal feelings are, but to establish that I am not a guy who couldn't believe that our government could do something like this. I still believe that they *could*. I just don't believe that they *did*. \n\nThe problem I have with the pro-conspiracy crowd is that they will do or say anything to support their narrative, but they will not give the time of day to other explanations. They have refused to change their stance when evidence and logic has overwhelmingly proved them wrong. In fact, they refuse to even acknowledge arguments or evidence that don't support their claims. \n\nI'll go through some of the major points here.\n\n**Building 7**\n\nThis was a major lynchpin in the early days of the conspiracy movement. Many people would simply hold up signs or post on messageboards \"Google WTC7\". I believe the idea was that they thought WTC7 wasn't reported on in the early days of/after 9/11, but I always found this weird because I clearly remember that it was. It just wasn't a focus because it was smaller and had been evacuated. The conspiracy crowd says this building wasn't hit by a plane and that it fell at freefall speed for no reason. I find this frustratingly specious, because while it wasn't hit by a plane, we have known for years exactly why it fell, and that it did not fall at freefall speeds. WTC 7 was hit by a very large section of the collapsing WTC1, which was on fire. This started a fire in 7 that burned unfought all day long. Every professional on the ground knew it was going to collapse (which is why the BBC reported it early). This makes it doubly dangerous to believe WTC7 conspiracies because you would have to believe the FDNY was in on it. They looked at it on an up close and personal level and knew it was coming down. To say it was demolished would be to say that the firefighters who were there are lying. This is not only incredibly offensive but it makes the conspiracy too big (who let them in on it and why? Why haven't any of them spilled the beans? What could they have been paid that was worth more than 343 of their brothers' lives?)\n\n**\"The buildings fell at freefall speeds\"**\n\nThis has been debunked for many years. There are videos where you can count from collapse initiation to the ground and see for yourself that the buildings fell at speeds consistent with such a collapse-- which is shockingly fast, but not freefall speed. To still be saying this after it has been so thoroughly proven wrong is not a mistake, it's a lie. \n\n**\"There was molten steel at ground zero\"**\n\nNot only is there zero evidence of molten steel at ground zero (besides pics that were proven to be photoshopped), a demolition wouldn't cause molten steel either. All that's here are eyewitness reports, which are notoriously unreliable. The most likely explanation is that people saw warped and deformed steel and used the casual term \"molten\" to describe it. \n\n**\"Larry Silverstein profited from the attacks\"\"** \n\nNo he didn't. And this is inconsistent with any conspiracy narrative. [**Edit:** see comments for further discussion of this point. Removed a superfluous reference here.]\n\n\nI could go point-by-point on many other aspects of this event, but my larger point here is that *the pro conspiracy crowd knows all of these arguments too, and refuses to acknowledge them.* That's not how facts or truth or logic or reasoning or science works. That's not how an investigation works. That's not how you get to the truth of a matter. \n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the 9/11 conspiracy theory is that it isn't a theory at all. A theory is a narrative. A theory explains. A theory adjusts for new information and corrects for mistaken, incomplete, or outdated information. The 9/11 conspiracy theory is none of this. It doesn't explain anything. It isn't internally or externally consistent. It doesn't make more sense than the mainstream narrative. It does not outcompete the mainstream narrative in the idea marketplace. In fact, no two believers in the inside job conspiracy seem to actually agree on all of the details. It only seeks to poke holes in the mainstream account, and refuses to acknowledge its own failures.\n\nI believe most conspiracy theorists do not understand the full mainstream narrative because it is difficult, complicated, goes back many years, and requires knowledge of geopolitics that can't really be grasped by youtube videos with scary music. The alternative theories are vague, exciting, make you feel like you have special knowledge, and are infinitely more appealing to people who are intellectually lazy. \n\nAm I saying that every detail we know or think we know about 9/11 is correct? No. Am I saying the US is perfect, or even innocent in this? No. It was blowback from our foreign policy in the Middle East. \n\nI am saying that 19 Arabs hijacked 4 planes and crashed them on 9/11/2001. This directly resulted in damage to the Pentagon, the collapse of WTCs 1, 2, and 7, and extensive damage to the rest of the WTC complex, and required no explosives and no cooperation from the US government. \n\nIn 13 years, the conspiracy crowd has not come up with a competing narrative that more accurately or more logically describes what happened that day.\n\nChange my view. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Many people would simply hold up signs or post on messageboards \"Google WTC7\". I believe the idea was that they thought WTC7 wasn't reported on in the early days of/after 9/11, but I always found this weird because I clearly remember that it was. It just wasn't a focus because it was smaller and had been evacuated. The conspiracy crowd says this building wasn't hit by a plane and that it fell at freefall speed for no reason. I find this frustratingly specious, because while it wasn't hit by a plane, we have known for years exactly why it fell, and that it did not fall at freefall speeds. WTC 7 was hit by a very large section of the collapsing WTC1, which was on fire. This started a fire in 7 that burned unfought all day long. Every professional on the ground knew it was going to collapse (which is why the BBC reported it early). This makes it doubly dangerous to believe WTC7 conspiracies because you would have to believe the FDNY was in on it. They looked at it on an up close and personal level and knew it was coming down. To say it was demolished would be to say that the firefighters who were there are lying. This is not only incredibly offensive but it makes the conspiracy too big (who let them in on it and why? Why haven't any of them spilled the beans? What could they have been paid that was worth more than 343 of their brothers' lives?)\n\n**\"The buildings fell at freefall speeds\"**\n\nThis has been debunked for many years. There are videos where you can count from collapse initiation to the ground and see for yourself that the buildings fell at speeds consistent with such a collapse-- which is shockingly fast, but not freefall speed. To still be saying this after it has been so thoroughly proven wrong is not a mistake, it's a lie. \n\n**\"There was molten steel at ground zero\"**\n\nNot only is there zero evidence of molten steel at ground zero (besides pics that were proven to be photoshopped), a demolition wouldn't cause molten steel either. All that's here are eyewitness reports, which are notoriously unreliable. The most likely explanation is that people saw warped and deformed steel and used the casual term \"molten\" to describe it. \n\n**\"Larry Silverstein profited from the attacks\"\"** \n\nNo he didn't. And this is inconsistent with any conspiracy narrative. [**Edit:** see comments for further discussion of this point. Removed a superfluous reference here.]\n\n\nI could go point-by-point on many other aspects of this event, but my larger point here is that *the pro conspiracy crowd knows all of these arguments too, and refuses to acknowledge them.* That's not how facts or truth or logic or reasoning or science works. That's not how an investigation works. That's not how you get to the truth of a matter. \n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the 9/11 conspiracy theory is that it isn't a theory at all. A theory is a narrative. A theory explains. A theory adjusts for new information and corrects for mistaken, incomplete, or outdated information. The 9/11 conspiracy theory is none of this. It doesn't explain anything. It isn't internally or externally consistent. It doesn't make more sense than the mainstream narrative. It does not outcompete the mainstream narrative in the idea marketplace. In fact, no two believers in the inside job conspiracy seem to actually agree on all of the details. It only seeks to poke holes in the mainstream account, and refuses to acknowledge its own failures.\n\nI believe most conspiracy theorists do not understand the full mainstream narrative because it is difficult, complicated, goes back many years, and requires knowledge of geopolitics that can't really be grasped by youtube videos with scary music. The alternative theories are vague, exciting, make you feel like you have special knowledge, and are infinitely more appealing to people who are intellectually lazy. \n\nAm I saying that every detail we know or think we know about 9/11 is correct? No. Am I saying the US is perfect, or even innocent in this? No. It was blowback from our foreign policy in the Middle East. \n\nI am saying that 19 Arabs hijacked 4 planes and crashed them on 9/11/2001. This directly resulted in damage to the Pentagon, the collapse of WTCs 1, 2, and 7, and extensive damage to the rest of the WTC complex, and required no explosives and no cooperation from the US government. \n\nIn 13 years, the conspiracy crowd has not come up with a competing narrative that more accurately or more logically describes what happened that day.\n\nChange my view. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It's a shell game, and several false stories ***have*** been inserted.  The thing about false stories though, is that you want them to strain credibility to the point where only fringe whackjobs are willing to believe them.  \n\nThe one thing that the American government can always rely on, is the fact that very few people among the public, and generally only basement dwelling outcasts like me, are willing to accept the idea that the government would be willing to do something like this to its' own people.  At its' core, this is the real reason in my mind, why virtually everyone who still insists on believing the official story of 9/11, still does so.  It's because if people start to realise that the government truly is unspeakably, psychopathically, demonically evil, they will lose the government as a parent, and they will have to become sovereign, grow up, and learn to think for and rely on themselves.  They do not want to do that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruEUCwVgHdk\n\nb}  Blaming Al Qaeda for controlled demolition is not consistent with the image of them, that the government wants to convey.  Namely that Islamic terrorists are the equivalent of Tusken raiders; a bunch of poor, primitive, desperate, Third World, swarthy brown people with virtually no resources of their own, other than old Russian armaments from the Cold War, and their own willingness to scream, \"Allah Ackbar!\" and blow people up.  It makes the terrorists much more intimidating if you depict them as being capable of great things, while still being rank amateurs with virtually no resources.\n\nhttp://media.popcultcha.com.au/media/catalog/product/s/i/sid100007.png\n\nRemote controlled demolition (especially against targets like the WTC) is not consistent with the desperate suicide bomber image.  Flying planes into the buildings, on the other hand, absolutely is.  A big part of the reason why is because it's a logical means of bringing down the buildings, whereas the government wants the public to view terrorists as being inherently insane, and an inexplicable force of nature in general terms; because in the Hitchcockian sense, anything that is inexplicable is automatically more scary.  Ramming planes is something that the proverbial suicidal, Wahhabist \"snackbars,\" (to quote 4chan) would do.

Later...\n\nSusan Lindauer's[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Lindauer) and her YouTube video titled [CIA WhistleBlower Susan Lindauer EXPOSES Everything! \"Extreme Prejudice\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68LUHa_-OlA) (1hr 36min 12sec)\n\n['9/11 was an inside job': Full speech by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at UN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4phNuwx8Hs) (33min 49sec)\n\nI saw the first video, but not the second one. Susan goes into a lot of detail about what she did for the US government/knows/doesn't know and tries to clarify what she knows from what she's heard from what she thinks. In conclusion, her theory is that the planes hit the buildings, and they were -also- hit by planted explosives, with the plane crashes providing cover for a demolition. That the government didn't cause the hijackings, but that they certainly took advantage of it, and were actively waiting/hoping for a situation like that to occur (and asking about potential hijackings with their foreign contacts).\n\nSo, if you believe she's not lying, she provides a compelling narrative. \n\nI can't personally verify that the twin towers even existed - I never went to New York and saw them with my own eyes. I'm relying on second or third-hand accounts for just about everything about this. So, the question is, how reliable is this information? What -does- one know first hand? Well, I've seen and been inside large buildings before, so I have some concept of them/the fact that they just don't collapse for no reason like a fort made out of cardboard. The towers were very large and in a well-known city of millions. I think someone would have noticed if they were still there/not collapsed. \n\nAnd then you just keep going through the data step by step as to the probability of each particular fact being likely or unlikely, or not just that, but known factualness versus seemingly plausibleness. E.g., evaluating whether something is evidence versus suspicion.\n\nThen there's stuff like, do you know anyone who's into metallurgy? Architecture/engineering? Maybe they have some first-hand experiences with materials/etc.?\n\nAs far as there being multiple theories... well, one comes out with a suspicion and then examines how plausible that suspicion is. One might have multiple suspicions that all seem plausible. And with your multiple theories, think, \"What evidence would help determine if it's more likely to be theory X rather than theory Y, or vice versa?\"\n\nAnother, with the person presenting the information, is their motive to be accurate, or to push an agenda? If it's an agenda, they may or may not be accurate depending on what serves them best. If it's accuracy, then evaluate on how competent they seem and so forth.\n\nMaybe contact the engineering department at a university, see if they've done any case studies on this?\n\nI think perhaps cynicism towards the government may be just as much to blame for failure to work this through objectively as disbelief that the government would do such a thing would cause someone to maintain a narrow view.\n\nWith the Sony hack, however... so many people are so very interested in this story, nations, individuals, companies... I think the public might be able to piece something very interesting together from all of this. Here's a good source of info: [\nA Breakdown and Analysis of the December, 2014 Sony Hack](https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2014/12/a-breakdown-and-analysis-of-the-december-2014-sony-hack/) by Risk Based Security. I think this situation might reawaken interest in piecing together, \"Ok, what do we *really* know about 9/11?\""}, {"id": "2pwuz4", "body": "I believed the 9/11 conspiracy theories as soon as I heard them. It was around 2004 and I was young and I had read Richard Clarke's book *Against All Enemies* and come out of it hating George W. Bush. I still have very strong negative opinions of the man and think history will judge him as one of our worst presidents. I was perfectly primed to believe Loose Change when I saw it. I say this not because you should care what my personal feelings are, but to establish that I am not a guy who couldn't believe that our government could do something like this. I still believe that they *could*. I just don't believe that they *did*. \n\nThe problem I have with the pro-conspiracy crowd is that they will do or say anything to support their narrative, but they will not give the time of day to other explanations. They have refused to change their stance when evidence and logic has overwhelmingly proved them wrong. In fact, they refuse to even acknowledge arguments or evidence that don't support their claims. \n\nI'll go through some of the major points here.\n\n**Building 7**\n\nThis was a major lynchpin in the early days of the conspiracy movement. Many people would simply hold up signs or post on messageboards \"Google WTC7\". I believe the idea was that they thought WTC7 wasn't reported on in the early days of/after 9/11, but I always found this weird because I clearly remember that it was. It just wasn't a focus because it was smaller and had been evacuated. The conspiracy crowd says this building wasn't hit by a plane and that it fell at freefall speed for no reason. I find this frustratingly specious, because while it wasn't hit by a plane, we have known for years exactly why it fell, and that it did not fall at freefall speeds. WTC 7 was hit by a very large section of the collapsing WTC1, which was on fire. This started a fire in 7 that burned unfought all day long. Every professional on the ground knew it was going to collapse (which is why the BBC reported it early). This makes it doubly dangerous to believe WTC7 conspiracies because you would have to believe the FDNY was in on it. They looked at it on an up close and personal level and knew it was coming down. To say it was demolished would be to say that the firefighters who were there are lying. This is not only incredibly offensive but it makes the conspiracy too big (who let them in on it and why? Why haven't any of them spilled the beans? What could they have been paid that was worth more than 343 of their brothers' lives?)\n\n**\"The buildings fell at freefall speeds\"**\n\nThis has been debunked for many years. There are videos where you can count from collapse initiation to the ground and see for yourself that the buildings fell at speeds consistent with such a collapse-- which is shockingly fast, but not freefall speed. To still be saying this after it has been so thoroughly proven wrong is not a mistake, it's a lie. \n\n**\"There was molten steel at ground zero\"**\n\nNot only is there zero evidence of molten steel at ground zero (besides pics that were proven to be photoshopped), a demolition wouldn't cause molten steel either. All that's here are eyewitness reports, which are notoriously unreliable. The most likely explanation is that people saw warped and deformed steel and used the casual term \"molten\" to describe it. \n\n**\"Larry Silverstein profited from the attacks\"\"** \n\nNo he didn't. And this is inconsistent with any conspiracy narrative. [**Edit:** see comments for further discussion of this point. Removed a superfluous reference here.]\n\n\nI could go point-by-point on many other aspects of this event, but my larger point here is that *the pro conspiracy crowd knows all of these arguments too, and refuses to acknowledge them.* That's not how facts or truth or logic or reasoning or science works. That's not how an investigation works. That's not how you get to the truth of a matter. \n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the 9/11 conspiracy theory is that it isn't a theory at all. A theory is a narrative. A theory explains. A theory adjusts for new information and corrects for mistaken, incomplete, or outdated information. The 9/11 conspiracy theory is none of this. It doesn't explain anything. It isn't internally or externally consistent. It doesn't make more sense than the mainstream narrative. It does not outcompete the mainstream narrative in the idea marketplace. In fact, no two believers in the inside job conspiracy seem to actually agree on all of the details. It only seeks to poke holes in the mainstream account, and refuses to acknowledge its own failures.\n\nI believe most conspiracy theorists do not understand the full mainstream narrative because it is difficult, complicated, goes back many years, and requires knowledge of geopolitics that can't really be grasped by youtube videos with scary music. The alternative theories are vague, exciting, make you feel like you have special knowledge, and are infinitely more appealing to people who are intellectually lazy. \n\nAm I saying that every detail we know or think we know about 9/11 is correct? No. Am I saying the US is perfect, or even innocent in this? No. It was blowback from our foreign policy in the Middle East. \n\nI am saying that 19 Arabs hijacked 4 planes and crashed them on 9/11/2001. This directly resulted in damage to the Pentagon, the collapse of WTCs 1, 2, and 7, and extensive damage to the rest of the WTC complex, and required no explosives and no cooperation from the US government. \n\nIn 13 years, the conspiracy crowd has not come up with a competing narrative that more accurately or more logically describes what happened that day.\n\nChange my view. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Also, I am not convinced they were responsible for hacking Sony. As a result, this really isn't a CMV about North Korea. http://www.wired.com/2014/12/evidence-of-north-korea-hack-is-thin/\n\nMy view is that the hack of Sony Pictures did much more good than harm, and therefore we should celebrate it (and encourage more hacking of big companies), not condemn it. I make this argument for numerous reasons, including:\n\n1) These major picture studios (like Sony) are basically evil.  And they deserve the fate of their evilness being exposed.  For decades they have been oppressing artists, imposing stupidity on us (and pretending it is culture), and been working harder than any other group to censor the internet and destroy it. The breaking of this news alone justifies the hack, in my opinion:\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2014/12/18/7417891/google-condemns-sony-project-goliath\n\nThis is by far the most important news to come from the leak.  and the people of reddit are probably very familiar with efforts of the movie studios to close down the internet to preserve their shitty business model. We need to oppose this, and outright condemn these bastards. Good for the hackers for making this public.\n\n2) This hack exposed the absolute stupidity that is Hollywood.  the most obvious example is that it conclusively proved that Jonah Hill is suffering from severe brain damage and needs to get help immediately. The only alternative is that he is illiterate and doesn't know what the words \"clean and rad and powerful\u201d mean. (warning: extreme depravity here, click at your own risk) http://time.com/3627859/jump-street-men-in-black-crossover-sony-pictures-hack/\n\n3) it proved (ok, maybe \"proved\" is a stretch, but provided good evidence) that hollywood is both racist and sexist. The racist part was shown by Sony's president being casually racist against Obama. the sexist part was shown by the fact that we got definitive proof they are aware and encourage that female actors are paid less than male ones. http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/14/sony-pictures-email-hack-greed-racism-sexism or http://www.cnet.com/news/13-revelations-from-the-sony-hack/\n\n4) We are all better off for not being subjected to more idiotic commercials for that stupid movie \"the interview\".  There is no chance that this movie was anything but total stupidity (and not even funny stupidity). I am so sick of seth rogan and james flacco (or whatever the fuck his name is), that I am glad this movie isn't coming out. good riddens. But further, it exposed how little these people (the honchos at these picture studios who pulled this movie) really care about art or public expression, and how vial and craven their greed is. I would consider dropping this movie a problem if it was a documentary or something that actually made us smarter, but it's just shit. even so, i would have expect the studios to defend their shitty movies on principle, but they didn't. and it is beneficial to know.\n\n5) all the outrage is total bullshit. and we as a society have benefited by shining a light on this. The key example is that you have all these government people calling this hack \"terrorism\" (yes, i am not confusing the threats on theaters with the hack. both are independently being called terrorism). and it is enlightening to see how shameless these idiots are in calling anything \"terrorism\". we benefit from that too.\n\n5) In all seriousness, I have heard that a bunch of SSNs were exposed by regular employees, and that seems to be a major problem.  So I am not ignoring that. But i haven't heard of any significant problems resulting, and assume that this being such a public hack, those people who have had their information published will have pretty strong grounds for defending themselves.\n\n6) I was going to put this higher on the list, but  I'm not sure they really did any more than say it wasn't a problem in their opinion. that said, it is sick that the US State Department is in cahoots with shitty films like this. it's messed up that the government has any say in making movies, and that this was exposed is a good thing. http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/12/18/state-dept-the-interview/\n\n...\n\nI could go on, there is so much embarrassing shit in this hack, it is great.  But my rant being over, I would be all for someone changing my view.  And let me give you some pointers on how to do that. (1) I am in favor of file sharing and dislike IP law in general. So don't waste your effort trying to convince me otherwise, (2) I think your best bet is to try to show that there is more actual harm here than I think (again, don't use IP as an example). But I feel like a lot of good was done, so you are going to have to show a hella-ton of harm, (3) like i said, let's not make this about north korea. but even if you do, you should know that i hate both the north korean and the american governments. so, i couldn't care less if they both got wrecked. i don't think you can convince me that the USA is some force for good and innocent and all that bullshit. (4) please please please don't tell me about freedom of speech unless you know something about the law.  This is not a 1st amendment issue, because there is no state action here.\n\nOk, let's hear the arguments.  thanks in advance. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We need to oppose this, and outright condemn these bastards. Good for the hackers for making this public.\n\n2) This hack exposed the absolute stupidity that is Hollywood.  the most obvious example is that it conclusively proved that Jonah Hill is suffering from severe brain damage and needs to get help immediately. The only alternative is that he is illiterate and doesn't know what the words \"clean and rad and powerful\u201d mean.

So don't waste your effort trying to convince me otherwise, (2) I think your best bet is to try to show that there is more actual harm here than I think (again, don't use IP as an example). But I feel like a lot of good was done, so you are going to have to show a hella-ton of harm, (3) like i said, let's not make this about north korea. but even if you do, you should know that i hate both the north korean and the american governments. so, i couldn't care less if they both got wrecked. i don't think you can convince me that the USA is some force for good and innocent and all that bullshit. (4) please please please don't tell me about freedom of speech unless you know something about the law.  This is not a 1st amendment issue, because there is no state action here.\n\nOk, let's hear the arguments.  thanks in advance. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For decades they have been oppressing artists, imposing stupidity on us (and pretending it is culture), and been working harder than any other group to censor the internet and destroy it. The breaking of this news alone justifies the hack, in my opinion:\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2014/12/18/7417891/google-condemns-sony-project-goliath\n\nThis is by far the most important news to come from the leak.  and the people of reddit are probably very familiar with efforts of the movie studios to close down the internet to preserve their shitty business model. We need to oppose this, and outright condemn these bastards. Good for the hackers for making this public.\n\n2) This hack exposed the absolute stupidity that is Hollywood.  the most obvious example is that it conclusively proved that Jonah Hill is suffering from severe brain damage and needs to get help immediately. The only alternative is that he is illiterate and doesn't know what the words \"clean and rad and powerful\u201d mean. (warning: extreme depravity here, click at your own risk) http://time.com/3627859/jump-street-men-in-black-crossover-sony-pictures-hack/\n\n3) it proved (ok, maybe \"proved\" is a stretch, but provided good evidence) that hollywood is both racist and sexist. The racist part was shown by Sony's president being casually racist against Obama. the sexist part was shown by the fact that we got definitive proof they are aware and encourage that female actors are paid less than male ones. http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/14/sony-pictures-email-hack-greed-racism-sexism or http://www.cnet.com/news/13-revelations-from-the-sony-hack/\n\n4) We are all better off for not being subjected to more idiotic commercials for that stupid movie \"the interview\".  There is no chance that this movie was anything but total stupidity (and not even funny stupidity). I am so sick of seth rogan and james flacco (or whatever the fuck his name is), that I am glad this movie isn't coming out. good riddens. But further, it exposed how little these people (the honchos at these picture studios who pulled this movie) really care about art or public expression, and how vial and craven their greed is. I would consider dropping this movie a problem if it was a documentary or something that actually made us smarter, but it's just shit. even so, i would have expect the studios to defend their shitty movies on principle, but they didn't. and it is beneficial to know.\n\n5) all the outrage is total bullshit. and we as a society have benefited by shining a light on this. The key example is that you have all these government people calling this hack \"terrorism\" (yes, i am not confusing the threats on theaters with the hack. both are independently being called terrorism). and it is enlightening to see how shameless these idiots are in calling anything \"terrorism\". we benefit from that too.\n\n5) In all seriousness, I have heard that a bunch of SSNs were exposed by regular employees, and that seems to be a major problem.  So I am not ignoring that. But i haven't heard of any significant problems resulting, and assume that this being such a public hack, those people who have had their information published will have pretty strong grounds for defending themselves.\n\n6) I was going to put this higher on the list, but  I'm not sure they really did any more than say it wasn't a problem in their opinion. that said, it is sick that the US State Department is in cahoots with shitty films like this. it's messed up that the government has any say in making movies, and that this was exposed is a good thing. http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/12/18/state-dept-the-interview/\n\n...\n\nI could go on, there is so much embarrassing shit in this hack, it is great.  But my rant being over, I would be all for someone changing my view.  And let me give you some pointers on how to do that. (1) I am in favor of file sharing and dislike IP law in general. So don't waste your effort trying to convince me otherwise, (2) I think your best bet is to try to show that there is more actual harm here than I think (again, don't use IP as an example). But I feel like a lot of good was done, so you are going to have to show a hella-ton of harm, (3) like i said, let's not make this about north korea. but even if you do, you should know that i hate both the north korean and the american governments. so, i couldn't care less if they both got wrecked. i don't think you can convince me that the USA is some force for good and innocent and all that bullshit. (4) please please please don't tell me about freedom of speech unless you know something about the law.  This is not a 1st amendment issue, because there is no state action here.\n\nOk, let's hear the arguments.  thanks in advance. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This was a shitty movie, and unlikely on its own to generate a sequel or action figures or anything. so the money generated to sony was largely going to be just in ticket sales for a regular shitty movie.  and all the costs were already paid out when they made the movie, so that side was done.  Sony budgets for so many flops a year, so that was already factored into the plan when they decided to make it.\n\nBut now, it is entirely possible that the resulting publicity from this hack makes the movie MORE popular and makes them more money. Id say, not just likely, but almost guaranteed.  it will undoubtedly make them more likely to make a sequel and have to hire more janitors and more junior programmers to make sure their data is better protected in the future. \n\nso i see this as likely a new benefit for both sony and the general economy and the little guy janitors."}, {"id": "cn0nj99", "body": "This was not an hack attack against a nuclear power plant. if that was the case, yeah, id be worried.  \n\nand the financials and all that being released, GOOD! it makes society better off to have more information. that is the basis of capitalism.

"}, {"id": "2pwbpf", "body": "I want to start by saying that I am not an apologist for the North Korean government.  Also, I am not convinced they were responsible for hacking Sony. As a result, this really isn't a CMV about North Korea. http://www.wired.com/2014/12/evidence-of-north-korea-hack-is-thin/\n\nMy view is that the hack of Sony Pictures did much more good than harm, and therefore we should celebrate it (and encourage more hacking of big companies), not condemn it. I make this argument for numerous reasons, including:\n\n1) These major picture studios (like Sony) are basically evil.  And they deserve the fate of their evilness being exposed.  For decades they have been oppressing artists, imposing stupidity on us (and pretending it is culture), and been working harder than any other group to censor the internet and destroy it. The breaking of this news alone justifies the hack, in my opinion:\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2014/12/18/7417891/google-condemns-sony-project-goliath\n\nThis is by far the most important news to come from the leak.  and the people of reddit are probably very familiar with efforts of the movie studios to close down the internet to preserve their shitty business model. We need to oppose this, and outright condemn these bastards. Good for the hackers for making this public.\n\n2) This hack exposed the absolute stupidity that is Hollywood.  the most obvious example is that it conclusively proved that Jonah Hill is suffering from severe brain damage and needs to get help immediately. The only alternative is that he is illiterate and doesn't know what the words \"clean and rad and powerful\u201d mean. (warning: extreme depravity here, click at your own risk) http://time.com/3627859/jump-street-men-in-black-crossover-sony-pictures-hack/\n\n3) it proved (ok, maybe \"proved\" is a stretch, but provided good evidence) that hollywood is both racist and sexist. The racist part was shown by Sony's president being casually racist against Obama. the sexist part was shown by the fact that we got definitive proof they are aware and encourage that female actors are paid less than male ones. http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/14/sony-pictures-email-hack-greed-racism-sexism or http://www.cnet.com/news/13-revelations-from-the-sony-hack/\n\n4) We are all better off for not being subjected to more idiotic commercials for that stupid movie \"the interview\".  There is no chance that this movie was anything but total stupidity (and not even funny stupidity). I am so sick of seth rogan and james flacco (or whatever the fuck his name is), that I am glad this movie isn't coming out. good riddens. But further, it exposed how little these people (the honchos at these picture studios who pulled this movie) really care about art or public expression, and how vial and craven their greed is. I would consider dropping this movie a problem if it was a documentary or something that actually made us smarter, but it's just shit. even so, i would have expect the studios to defend their shitty movies on principle, but they didn't. and it is beneficial to know.\n\n5) all the outrage is total bullshit. and we as a society have benefited by shining a light on this. The key example is that you have all these government people calling this hack \"terrorism\" (yes, i am not confusing the threats on theaters with the hack. both are independently being called terrorism). and it is enlightening to see how shameless these idiots are in calling anything \"terrorism\". we benefit from that too.\n\n5) In all seriousness, I have heard that a bunch of SSNs were exposed by regular employees, and that seems to be a major problem.  So I am not ignoring that. But i haven't heard of any significant problems resulting, and assume that this being such a public hack, those people who have had their information published will have pretty strong grounds for defending themselves.\n\n6) I was going to put this higher on the list, but  I'm not sure they really did any more than say it wasn't a problem in their opinion. that said, it is sick that the US State Department is in cahoots with shitty films like this. it's messed up that the government has any say in making movies, and that this was exposed is a good thing. http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/12/18/state-dept-the-interview/\n\n...\n\nI could go on, there is so much embarrassing shit in this hack, it is great.  But my rant being over, I would be all for someone changing my view.  And let me give you some pointers on how to do that. (1) I am in favor of file sharing and dislike IP law in general. So don't waste your effort trying to convince me otherwise, (2) I think your best bet is to try to show that there is more actual harm here than I think (again, don't use IP as an example). But I feel like a lot of good was done, so you are going to have to show a hella-ton of harm, (3) like i said, let's not make this about north korea. but even if you do, you should know that i hate both the north korean and the american governments. so, i couldn't care less if they both got wrecked. i don't think you can convince me that the USA is some force for good and innocent and all that bullshit. (4) please please please don't tell me about freedom of speech unless you know something about the law.  This is not a 1st amendment issue, because there is no state action here.\n\nOk, let's hear the arguments.  thanks in advance. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But I feel like a lot of good was done, so you are going to have to show a hella-ton of harm, (3) like i said, let's not make this about north korea. but even if you do, you should know that i hate both the north korean and the american governments. so, i couldn't care less if they both got wrecked. i don't think you can convince me that the USA is some force for good and innocent and all that bullshit. (4) please please please don't tell me about freedom of speech unless you know something about the law.  This is not a 1st amendment issue, because there is no state action here.\n\nOk, let's hear the arguments.  thanks in advance. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even if that is an exaggeration, you'll find this fear to be near the top of the list of human phobias. Why, then, do we FORCE children in school through this? Not only do I think that forcing children to face this fear DOES NOT make them any more used to it than they were before, but it actually causes PTSD in regards to public speaking and social situations later in life and makes it less likely that the average person will be willing to engage in public speaking when they actually have something to say. I'm not saying public speaking shouldn't be a part of school, but it should be a choice for the natural public speakers and should not used as an initiation practice into public life or adulthood. I am mainly speaking from my own personal experience when I say that being forced to stand in front of a crowd of people and lie through my teeth (spouting off words I don't really understand or care about at a deep level) caused severe psychological damage and panic attacks. I don't see any virtue in getting a frightened child to perform this act when they are not ready, and is there any evidence that doing this actually helps people or makes them stronger, smarter, or more capable? \n\n****EDIT\nI'd like to thank everyone for your replies, now I have a more accurate picture of the cultural attitudes surrounding this issue. I think I have misused the word \"desensitization\" since it is a therapeutic method to correct phobia. So the type of desensitization which I am referring (a type of numbing) will have to be researched in more depth.\n\n**Edit 2  This is a response I posted which clears up some of my views on the points people have raised:\n\nExcept forcing small children into these situation may actually exacerbate the problem. You and I both know that being forced into these situations can cause lasting trauma and does not help us get over these experiences. The best we can do is suppress them and pretend they helped us when they didn't. There are things in life that aren't avoidable, but to artificially induce these threatening situations on a child before they are psychologically ready to handle them, without proper care and training beforehand, can cause lasting effects. My argument from the beginning is that there is a reason why surveys show public speaking to be feared more than death. Unlike math, unlike science, unlike other subjects that can be done on an individual level--being placed before an assembly of witnesses triggers one of humanity's deepest fears, which is fear of ostracism. Reading out loud and gym class, other activities where you are performing before others can place a child in the mindset that they are about to be socially ostracized. That can cause serious trauma, that stuff runs really deep in the psyche. Children should instead be taught with care and more adequate preparation to stand in front of others, how to deal with pressure and the perception of judgment, than just being thrown into it cold turkey.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Unfortunately, we have to face uncomfortable situations in the real world.  Most people will have to give presentations in their line of work, whether it be to customers, coworkers, or bosses.  Nobody likes doing this and its always stressful.  At least having some low risk experience on how to prepare and deliver a speech/presentation will help alleviate the anxiety.  Also, an adult has to maintain their composure and handle stressful to the best of their abilities.  Public speaches are a crash course in this.\n\n&gt;How about not forcing children to trauma whatsoever period?\n\nStress/anxiety does not equal trauma.  Yes, there are a few cases where children genuinely do suffer from social anxiety, and they should be accomodated, but the majority of children are totally capable of delivering speeches, and should be assigned to do it, even if it might cause some stress."}, {"id": "cn0m89o", "body": "Math is a subject, one that many kids don't like, but public speaking is *many people's worst fear.* How is this point being glossed over like it means nothing?\n\n&gt;If you have a deathly fear of speaking in front of 30 classmates at 10 years old, how the hell are you supposed to speak to a group of people in a professional setting?\n\nThis makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

If children are genuinely in a terrified state, being coerced to do things that their stress level cannot handle, then we are systematically abusing children and setting them up for serious psychological problems down the road, and this needs to stop. \n\n&gt;For the record, I do believe you.

Anyone can do that. It's about preparing a well thought out argument/presentation, researching facts, finding elements that support your presentation, and conveying information. Public speaking isn't always reserved for politicians either. At my job my coworkers and I are often asked to explain work flow changes or lead the team meetings. This does take some skill, as well as preparation. I don't have some glamorous or high paying job, but it's part of the deal. \n\nPublic speaking isn't just about the act of public speaking - it's about interacting and conveying a message. Unless you don't want to ever talk to other people you need to know how to do this. Yes it can cause some anxiety for some, but it is a skill that needs to be learned. If anyone's anxiety is so bad then maybe they can get disability accomodation after having their doctor submit the paperwork to the school. True anxiety does need to be managed - but unfortunately if it was just an option for everyone and not a requirement then a lot more people would claim anxiety instead of just putting in the work. \n\nIf anything, people with true anxiety would not want other people using anxiety of public speaking as an excuse to get out of it. One may be anxious, but it shouldn't damage them. If a person is being treated by a doctor for anxiety then I could see waiving the requirement of public speaking. Personally I don't like when people who don't suffer from a disability claim it to get out of doing things, when I suffer daily from that particular ailment. I feel it downplays the severity of it. I wouldn't want an entire population of people to be unsensitive to the condition of anxiety. It is severe and needs medical treatment. It is not to be taken lightly, and if you can just claim it without proof that could cause problems. People wouldn't take anxiety seriously as a medical condition, which it should be.\n\nTL;DR: We can't just let people out of doing things because they say they have a medical condition.

I do, but I partially disagree with the question. The fact everyone does it means people have support. If you have ever, and I mean EVER, snickered, laughed, scoffed, rolled your eyes, sneered, or done ANYTHING that was not 100% supportive of a classmate's presentation then you kind of prove my point: everyone futzes up at some point. EVERYONE. Even natural public speakers.\n\nNow here is where I disagree with your question: I have seen people struggle with public speaking. I have NEVER seen ANYONE traumatized or even affected for longer than a few days by a bad presentation. You seem to be generalizing your own experience to all people. Yes, many people fear public speaking. But having experiences such as yours is not the norm.\n\nNow to clarify: the 85% statistic was a mere hypothetical. I have no idea what the actual statistic is. I used it as an example to indicate that even when that many fear public speaking, an amount that is very likely above the number that would be found by chance, it is still a good idea to teach it.\n\n&gt; Serious question--why would you be threatened by a person who refuses to speak publicly because they are afraid of it?

For instance Hall of Fame Inductees, Nobel Laureates and Academy Award winners have to give speeches. \n\n* Between those (and other) needs, pubic speaking can greatly impact your ability to function economically, politically and socially. It is important for a lot of things, and almost any leadership role requires more or less the ability to speak to a group of more than one person. Public speaking may not be 100% required for every life, but it's pretty important for easily 95% of people, in one form or another. \n\nSchools are designed to prepare people for life in \"the real world.\" If a school can do something to help 95% of people be better prepared, that's a positive thing for the school to do. **Can you agree that in general, for people NOT like you, public speaking is a) important for life a a broad number of ways, and b) a good thing for schools to teach?** If you can't agree that is (in general) true, then we have a problem, and you are somewhat delusional. \n\nNow, for at least 50% of people, telling the class something is a total non-issue. For the other 50%, they might not want to do it. For 80% of those 50%, they suck it up and do it no problem. Now, the final 10% might be more than a little miffed, and surely you fall into the last 10% (bear in mind these numbers are the grossest approximations, and are not meant to actually be statistics). But still, I think that 3 out of 4 times, those people ought to do it. In some cases the issue might be a lack of preparation, and a teacher helping students be more confident in what they have to say can fix that. In some cases they ought to \"grow a pair,\" and get over petty fears. After all, many philosophers, contemporary or historical, have argued that the qualities of mental toughness, overcoming fears and trying new, difficult things are vital. Those qualities may lead to people leading more fulfilling, interesting lives, or strengthening their character and becoming superior people. Most fears can be defeated, and doing difficult things, such as overcoming fears, builds character. \n\nNow I did leave a final 2.5% of people, one out of 40, and I'm also sure you would be in that category. However, in the end, the decision comes down to a few things: \n\n* A true fear of public speaking is an irrational fear. There is no reason to care THAT much about how people will judge you over the act of giving a small presentation. Fear of rejection is real, but it should be overcome. Furthermore, in all my years I don't remember a single time I talked about a bad presentation in school. People who are THAT anxious really are afraid of something that doesn't exist. The fact is, none of their peers care at all either way, and may or may not even be paying attention. No one is going to have to face terrible rumors about stuttering or accidentally misspeaking. The fear is unfounded. For a number of reasons, this ought to be overcome to help you become a more able and mentally more resilient person in general. The goal for all students should be overcoming this anxiety, either by repetition, \"toughening up,\" or therapy techniques, or a combination of the three. \n\n* Public speaking is an important skill, as mentioned above. If at all possible, it should be taught. While some students may have trouble physically doing it, or trouble mentally coping with the process of doing so, in the end, the final goal should be to be able to give a good presentation and learn those skills. \n\nI think only in the worst cases, once other options are exhausted, should a student be totally exempt from all forms of public speaking in class, and this should be discussed with anyone who might be able to help, including teachers, parents, counselors and therapists. Now, you might be one of the worst cases, judging on your comments. But for 99% of people, I think it is legitimate to \"force\" a student towards the goal of making a good public presentation. So I guess maybe I agree with you, but in practice, for 99% of students it should not be abolished. \n\n"}, {"id": "2pw8jp", "body": "According to this [Psychology Today](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-real-story-risk/201211/the-thing-we-fear-more-death) article, we fear public speaking more than death.

This suggests that the anxiety was less about the act of standing up and speaking but about the possible incorrectness and unimportance of the material being presented. If this is so, then it was the lack of proper preparation that needs to be addressed, by the teacher creating a more engaging topic and helping students learn how to research, make notecards, etc. and then the students going through an adequate amount of preparation. Like anything, doing certain work beforehand will lessen anxiety and increases chances of success, which would lead to greater comfort in the future.\n\nSecond, I find it inappropriate to call public speaking an \"initiation practice,\" unless the claim is extended to treat all education and assessment as simply an act of initiation. The goal of education is to provide knowledge and create/hone skills. Public speaking is a valuable skill, even if you can argue it isn't strictly necessary. Requiring students to participate in some form of public speaking is in service on that larger goal. Ideally, students will begin at a young age with small, simple speaking assignments and progress to more complicated presentations as their skills and confidence accrue. When well designed, these cumulative projects, over the course of years, work to combat the anxiety before it can become crippling.\n\nFinally, let's be clear that students are never actually forced to do public speaking. They always have the option of simply not completing an assignment. Of course, their grade will suffer. The same rules applies for every style of project. If a student is truly as afraid as you suggest, they can forgo it and take the consequences of that choice. This is the way things work; if they opt out of certain career choices because of their fear, there are other kinds of consequences.

It was embarrassing feeling like I was behind my peers in a lot of regards and being happy to just pass a test.

I don't think the mere exercising of the powers I mentioned is in and of itself abusive or totalitarian. I am just listing powers that, for good or for evil, the state currently possesses.\n\nThat said, once the state has the obligation or the right to make regulations, laws or licenses in order to protect the public interest (many of the ones you mention are perfectly reasonable examples of this), it needs only extend this principle for fiscal and moral reasons to the ability to reproduce. The state could make the following argument:\n\n\"Having children without the ability to financially or emotionally care for them causes massive societal drain. Between the money that needs to be spent to care for these children and the link between crime and poverty, the state has, for the public interest, a compelling interest in regulating and preventing reproduction of its citizens.\"\n\nThis argument (to me, at least) is consistent with the government's stated goals and current powers and is a much more forceful argument than many of the things I listed. My other main point is that, had this argument been made and won half a century ago, we would not see the prohibition on childbirth as anything different than many of the other ones I listed."}, {"id": "cn0o6nf", "body": "In most of your examples the state is preventing or regulating things where as with the issue of sterilization you're talking about the state acting upon an individual in an invasive manner that forces further dependency on the state (reversing the proceedure)."}, {"id": "cn0iu6c", "body": "&gt; The ability to travel to a different country.\n\nIs something perpetrated by the far right and fear of immigration (e.g. Daily Mail).

They have multiple classes or professions at max level.\n\n2.)They have hard to come by items and equipment, putting them in a higher perceived skill ceiling over the player base.\n\nGenerally, these two concepts get thrown around in discussions or arguments, to kind of say \"My experience speaks louder than yours, so be silent.\" I don't think this is inherently true for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFirstly, with multiple max level characters, the modern MMO scheme makes it impossible to take any real amount of time or commitment to getting to level cap. Even then, it's merely a time commitment as it's not something that is particularly difficult, it just takes time. Even if someone has every conceivable level maxed out, it only speaks to how long they have feasibly had their account and not how good or respect worthy they are.\n\n\nAs far as gear is concerned, in the modern MMO space, if you just put enough time in 90% of the time you'll walk away with the best gear available. MMOs have long since shied away from difficult meaningful content that is little more than a barrier that needs to be jumped through, compared to MMOs from years ago like Everquest or Final Fantasy XI, where not only did it take a specific amount of skill but took months or years of working on a specific item to completion. \n\nI do believe in the basic modicum of respect to all other players, but I actually lose respect towards people who use these two aspects of the game to measure a person's ability to play or their value to a group, and while I doubt I am, I'm willing to accept I may be wrong.
