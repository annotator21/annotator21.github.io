I wanna say this is how Jersey is set up, but I forget.\n\nThe worst is no exit numbers at all, a la Chicago. Then again, Chicago is also where 90 East goes south and 90 West goes north."}, {"id": "2qgkou", "body": "There are two major methods of identifying highway exits in the United States. One is to identify them by mile marker, the other is to use a simple ordinal system.\n\nThe state of New York identifies highway exits by simply choosing one end of the highway and starting to count exits up one at a time. For example, exit 1 on I-90 is located in Yonkers, while exit 61 is the last before the Pennsylvania border. [A list of the exits.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway#Mainline_2)\n\nThis has a number of significant problems. First, the addition of new exits results in the addition of extremely confusing \"A\" and \"B\" exits. It's much easier than renumbering all the exits on the highway, but it's also extremely confusing. Second, portions of the highway not on the main line need a separate system. The NYS Thruway uses B1-B3 for the connector to the Massachusetts Turnpike. And third, there is no way of knowing how far it is to the next exit. I know I got on at exit 12 and need to get off at exit 20, but I have no idea if the distance is 20 miles or 120 miles.\n\nThe second option is far superior. States like Ohio and Pennsylvania identify highway exits by the mile marker. If you get on the highway at exit 20 and plan to get off at exit 120, you know that you will be driving 100 miles. This is very sensible. Also, adding a new exit is simple! If there is no other exit in that highway mile, adding a new number is trivial. In the case of multiple exits in the same mile, A and B is easy to understand and also alerts drivers to the fact that multiple exits will be happening in a short space of road.\n\nFinally, states like New York are *already* numbering the miles on their highways to use in support of law enforcement and emergency crews to identify the location of accidents. It would be relatively easy to change the system and there would be only benefits to adopting the mile marker system.\n\nCMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You've based it around shame. Shame is an emotional feeling and is experienced differently by varying people within varying societies. What is shameful for you is not necessarily shameful for me.\n\n2. You're assuming they took a last minute turn that was not planned. This is highly unlikely. Sony is a corporation, their primary function (and from an executive standpoint, their sole function) is to make profits. They analyze risk vs. reward. When they believed releasing the movie was more risky, which was very fair to believe considering the potential blow back of provoking an attack and endangering innocent lives, they held back. They are a CORPORATION, not a GOVERNMENT. Governments do not succumb to terrorism, corporations do. When they had the media openly supporting their release and their consumers demanding it, they now see the reward clearly outweighing any risks, thus they can profit. No one shamed them into anything.\n\n3. You seem to be teetering on the idea of morality without explicitly stating it. I do not want to put words in your mouth, but I have reread your argument (to be fair, it was a rather short one) many times and it appears to me that you're trying to say that Sony did a *wrong* thing (not releasing the movie initially), and that makes an otherwise *wrong thing* (pirating a movie) become a *right* thing (because they deserve it).

So if they do a good job, then they would get more money. In a salary situation they get paid a set amount of money and that is it.\n\nYou see spending money isn't just spending money. It's also a form of communication. By choosing to spend money you are telling people things like \"I like this\", \"I want more of this\", \"This is the best option for me\", and the like. Whereas not spending money says things like \"I don't like this\", \"This is of lower quality\", \"I prefer spending my money on other things\", and the like.\n\nBy not spending money on the things you watch, regardless of how Sony bungled the release, you are sending the wrong messages to other people in the industry. Mangled releases have destroyed acting careers as the ability to sell tickets/downloads/TV air time is measured and compared between actors, someone in a series of flops in a row (for whatever reason) is unlikely to get another job.\n\nMoreover, Sony doesn't have money. The way that Sony has money is because we (the consumers) gave Sony money in exchange for something that we want. So, either we give money for *The Interview* which they then give to the actors and crew or we give money for *any other movie* which they then give to actors and crew of *The Interview* at the expense of another set of actors and crew.\n\nIf you pay for the things you consume then you will get more of it, the creative people get paid, and the whole thing works. If you don't pay for the things you consume then the whole system gradually breaks down, it's not going to immediately be destroyed in perpetuity forever because one person pirated one thing, just that something that used to work well works gradually less well over time until it breaks completely."}, {"id": "cn5njcg", "body": "If the case is that the crew would lose a significant amount of money due to this, I feel that the responsibilty should fal on Sony.

The fact that they weren't able to reach deals with all the big players (Netflix, Apple Store, etc) is probably just as likely due to unreasonable terms from said players as much as if not more than Sony.\n\nI don't think there's any evidence to suggest that Sony intentionally created or lied about an international incident for money, and the online rental/sales of the interview are less $ then a moderate theatrical release.  It cost $44 million to make, and made $1 million on Christmas eve on its release.\n\nIf you don't want to reward the studio for mismanagement, don't see it.

I think they are the shittiest creatures on this planet and if I had a time machine I would almost certainly do my best to make sure they were never adopted as pets.\n\nNow for a long time I was impartial to the ownership of cats, it did not really bother me, but a month or so back some of our neighbours got one.  Since that happened it has been giving us hell.  The damn thing keeps stealing food from our house, scratching furniture and coming home at night to find a cat on your bed if you happen to be allergic to them is the worst thing ever.  So, why don't I just keep my house closed you might ask?  Well I live in South Africa and due to the expense of air-conditioning we primarily cool our house by leaving windows and doors open.  Additionally I do not see why we should be forced to change our lifestyle so the neighbours can own a cat.  \n\nBasically I feel cat ownership should be illegal mainly as it negatively impacts the lives of other people in your community forcing them to adapt to your cat.  Additionally cats do a great deal of damage to the local environment by killing many small birds and reptiles.  For example we had chameleons in our yard for quite some time and they were awesome, but then our neighbour's cat killed them all.\n\nNow I know there are probably people who somehow manage to keep their cats confined to their house or yard somehow and I have no issue with these people.   Let them be able to apply for a cat ownership license and be subject to a fine if their cat happens to wander into your yard.\n\nEdit - Additionally I found that the region where I live has legislature that it is illegal if dogs are not \"properly and adequately fenced to keep such a dog inside when it is not on a leash, unless the dog is confined to the premises in some other manner\".  In essence I feel this law should apply to cats as well.\n\n\n2nd edit - View has been changed by stevegcook.  The fact that cats can be kept indoors means that legislation holding cat-owners responsible for their cats is feasible.

I'm fine with doubling that cost since my plan probably includes more people.\n\nBut anyways, there's three main reasons I think we should do this:\n\n1. Moral/philosophical reasons: The US first put blacks through years of slavery. Then, in the Jim Crow south, their property was deliberately taken from them, often in ways that law enforcement would ignore or even support. But even after the Civil Rights act, the problems were still there. Many blacks were forced into lower-income neighborhoods. Many of them still received lower-quality education, not only because of segregation, but also because people didn't want to allocate resources to \"black areas.\" In addition to the fact that they don't have access to the networking that many whites did, I believe all of these made it so that blacks systematically were deprived of any shot at equality. The issue with this is that they all consented to the governance of the US just as much as the whites did, and deserved equal protection according to the constitution. When a government fails to fulfill the social contract, it has an obligation to attempt to correct for it, or else it is not a legitimate government that can be held to any sort of social contract or constitution.\n\n2. Economic/social reasons: I think this would at least be a meaningful step to economic equality for blacks. I think this is really important is because a lot of the reason racism is still alive today is because blacks tend to be around blacks and whites tend to be around whites, so there's no exposure to the other races. This makes it much easier to stereotype blacks as lazy, or thuggish, or less intelligent, whether the stereotypes are conscious or subconscious. If you give blacks more money, they have more access to education resources, which allows them to get to private schools, or better colleges, or better professions. The more blacks have access to these opportunities, the less that people are going to be able to stereotype them as thugs, or in less severe cases, subconsciously assume that blacks are of a poorer or less educated background. I think the latter is the source of most racism today, and that by getting more blacks in higher positions would solve it through exposure theory.\n\n3. Political reasons: I think it would be an important symbolic statement from the government. Many poor black communities are ravaged by crime because they have a sense of abandonment from the government, and feel less of an obligation to respect it. I think the actual money would solve for a lot of this, but the statement alone is a recognition of past harms and shows solidarity and understanding with them. I think this would lead to less disillusionment in these communities\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

An average  citizen who actually is employed and earns his own way in america without government help (wow what a concept) will work an average of ~40 years (you've not specified a duration for this white tax) will pay $31K for racism that they never took place in.\n\nCouple this with the fact that the US is already spending itself into oblivion with an $18t deficit with an unprecedented number of social security and welfare programs, and the argument that you should receive free money for being born black is asinine as there's too much free money flowing as it is.\n\nTL;DR get a job\n\n"}, {"id": "2qf9r3", "body": "I know there were a few posts about reparations but I don't think the arguments they were making were very compelling.\n\nFor context, this [forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/05/25/if-there-should-be-reparations-for-american-slavery-the-amount-should-be-around-about-nothing/) estimates the costs would be $70 billion, about that of the food stamp program, if we payed $1,600 per year to all descendents of slaves.

This makes it much easier to stereotype blacks as lazy, or thuggish, or less intelligent, whether the stereotypes are conscious or subconscious. If you give blacks more money, they have more access to education resources, which allows them to get to private schools, or better colleges, or better professions. The more blacks have access to these opportunities, the less that people are going to be able to stereotype them as thugs, or in less severe cases, subconsciously assume that blacks are of a poorer or less educated background.

There are a few reasons for this:\n\n* The US Government is paid for by all of the people in the United States. So what you are saying is all people who pay taxes should pay black families reparations. I think public money should only be used on programs the benefit the vast majority of the public. Reparations would only benefit a very small portion of people and everyone would be paying for it including people that were not part of the problem. Other minority groups such as Hispanics and Asian immigrants and Blacks themselves would be part of this set of taxpayers. Immigrants who weren't even in the US at the time would be paying. Even ancestors of white people who were abolitionists, dedicated their lives to fighting against slavery, and died in the civil war would still be paying reparations.\n* Even if you limited payments to only white people who owned slaves the people who would be paying the bill are not the people who were responsible for slavery. If someone commits a crime, say a murder-suicide, would you put the child in prison for it since the parent is dead? In ancient cultures they used to do this type of thing and I don't think moving back to the way things were done 1,000 years ago is the right way to go.\n* It reinforces the idea of family entitlement. The trend in the United States is for the child to be completely separate from the fiances of the parent. You don't inherit debt for instance. People should be on as much of a level playing ground as possible and getting money because of something that happened to your parents did lowers social mobility. This would hurt not help things in the long run.\n* The people who you'd be paying are not the people who originally experienced slavery. They likely don't even know their descendant and have no personal connection to them whatsoever. It would be one thing to give back wages to slaves that are currently alive. You could maybe make a case for the wife or children of slaves if they were growing up in slavery. But someone who is 3-7 generations removed from an ancestor it's so far in the distant past that doesn't directly affect their lives.\n* The people who would collecting reparations would be doing so out of an interest to in getting income and solely for that reason. As mentioned in the previous point they likely don't even know who their ancestors are. The vast majority of people would probably treat reparations payments with the same indifference that they treat holidays like Memorial Day. They would also display the same greed as seen in major public class actions payments such as the Red Bull payment earlier this year.\n* Reparations wouldn't actually solve any of the problems that the Black community currently experiences. $1,600 per year is not enough to pay for college, buy a car, buy a house, or invest in any meaningful amount of job training. Because of this a large amount of the money would likely get spent on things such as Entertainment which won't do anything to help them. Like any mass pay out to a group that statistically is lower income and more disadvantaged there is a risk that a significant amount of money might also go for drugs which is exactly the opposite of what we want to fund.\n* There have been many groups that have experienced wrongs in the past. Native Americans had it much worse than Blacks did. The genocide from the European Colonization of the Americas is many times the size of the holocaust and the largest in human history.\n* **It focuses on the past instead of focusing on the future.** We should be trying to move towards a society where there is no racial discrimination. If we truly believe that all people are created equal and deserve equal opportunities then we should be implementing programs that work towards these goals regardless of race. Creating special programs only for Black people doesn't work towards this goal.\n\nThings we can do to actually help solve the problems that minorities face in this country:\n\n* Create a fund to give Federal or State Dollars to high-need low income school districts which have less money per student because of low property values\n* Lower the cost of higher education to make it more accessible to to more people\n* Create more need based scholarships\n* Reverse the budget cuts to the Pell Grant System\n* Address the explosion in student loans and do everything you can to get people on other types of aid\n* Create alternative paths to the middle class besides college\n* Invest in public transportation infrastructure (the poor disportionately don't have cars, poor transit limits work options)\n* Provide social welfare programs that specifically invest in the disadvantaged people to get them to be self-sufficient\n* Reform the criminal justice system to focus on preventing crime instead of getting revenge on a person (including getting rid of zero tolerance programs, three strikes laws, and mandatory minimums for many classes of crimes)\n* Invest in child care programs for low income families so they can work while their kids are taken care of.\n* Provide mentoring and tutoring to poor children growing up in single parent households to help compensate for the lack of a father in the home and limited time the parents have available to help with homework or help deal with problems.\n* Help create strong communities of low income people that can support each other in the event that something happens."}, {"id": "2qf9r3", "body": "I know there were a few posts about reparations but I don't think the arguments they were making were very compelling.\n\nFor context, this [forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/05/25/if-there-should-be-reparations-for-american-slavery-the-amount-should-be-around-about-nothing/) estimates the costs would be $70 billion, about that of the food stamp program, if we payed $1,600 per year to all descendents of slaves.

Many of them still received lower-quality education, not only because of segregation, but also because people didn't want to allocate resources to \"black areas.\" In addition to the fact that they don't have access to the networking that many whites did, I believe all of these made it so that blacks systematically were deprived of any shot at equality. The issue with this is that they all consented to the governance of the US just as much as the whites did, and deserved equal protection according to the constitution. When a government fails to fulfill the social contract, it has an obligation to attempt to correct for it, or else it is not a legitimate government that can be held to any sort of social contract or constitution.\n\n2. Economic/social reasons: I think this would at least be a meaningful step to economic equality for blacks. I think this is really important is because a lot of the reason racism is still alive today is because blacks tend to be around blacks and whites tend to be around whites, so there's no exposure to the other races. This makes it much easier to stereotype blacks as lazy, or thuggish, or less intelligent, whether the stereotypes are conscious or subconscious. If you give blacks more money, they have more access to education resources, which allows them to get to private schools, or better colleges, or better professions. The more blacks have access to these opportunities, the less that people are going to be able to stereotype them as thugs, or in less severe cases, subconsciously assume that blacks are of a poorer or less educated background. I think the latter is the source of most racism today, and that by getting more blacks in higher positions would solve it through exposure theory.\n\n3. Political reasons: I think it would be an important symbolic statement from the government. Many poor black communities are ravaged by crime because they have a sense of abandonment from the government, and feel less of an obligation to respect it. I think the actual money would solve for a lot of this, but the statement alone is a recognition of past harms and shows solidarity and understanding with them. I think this would lead to less disillusionment in these communities\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

On March 14, 1891 eleven Italian-Americans were lynched in New Orleans after a jury found them not guilty in the case of the murder of a New Orleans police chief. The eleven were falsely accused of being associated with the Mafia. This incident was the largest mass lynching in US history. Lynchings of Italian-Americans occurred mostly in the South but also occured in NY, PA, and CO. The toll of lynchings in general began to taper off strongly in the 1930's and 1940's. \n\nThey were the second largest group of lynch victims?\n\nhttp://www.greatblacksinwax.org/Exhibits/lynching.htm\n\nJews were discriminated against in the world as well. \n\nsee this image that was taken in AMERICA post WWII \n\nhttp://history105.libraries.wsu.edu/fall2014/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/08/jewsnotallowed-300x291.jpg\n\nPeople of Latin/Spanish ancestory as well.

I think this is really important is because a lot of the reason racism is still alive today is because blacks tend to be around blacks and whites tend to be around whites, so there's no exposure to the other races. This makes it much easier to stereotype blacks as lazy, or thuggish, or less intelligent, whether the stereotypes are conscious or subconscious. If you give blacks more money, they have more access to education resources, which allows them to get to private schools, or better colleges, or better professions. The more blacks have access to these opportunities, the less that people are going to be able to stereotype them as thugs, or in less severe cases, subconsciously assume that blacks are of a poorer or less educated background. I think the latter is the source of most racism today, and that by getting more blacks in higher positions would solve it through exposure theory.\n\n3. Political reasons: I think it would be an important symbolic statement from the government. Many poor black communities are ravaged by crime because they have a sense of abandonment from the government, and feel less of an obligation to respect it. I think the actual money would solve for a lot of this, but the statement alone is a recognition of past harms and shows solidarity and understanding with them.

Period. Money can allow access to mechanisms to address it, but that's all.\n\nThe financial damage is also, ironically, often not undone by a any lump sum of money, since systemic problems and resource management maintain far more ongoing impact than any single cash insertion.\n\nThink of someone who suddenly wins $500k as a lump sum. How long does it last? What do they spend it on? This will be determined by the way *they already think about money, life, priorities, etc.*\n\nI do not say this to blame anyone disproportionately for how they handle resources, but instead to say that genuine reparations are far more complex than handing someone money. The whole way we treat people has to change.\n\n--------\n\nMoreover, this entire approach fails to account for how all other minorities (ethnic and otherwise!) have been affected. How much should be given to Southeast Asian Americans? Mexican Americans? *All women?* How can that possibly even be calculated with any kind of equity?\n\nWhere does it stop?\n\n------\n\nA better way to establish meaningful reparations might be to universally equalize \"basic needs\" funding for all citizens: education, health care, food, shelter, etc. (At the VERY least, education.) An flat amount given to every citizen establishes a floor-level minimum of basic support that helps middle-to-upper class very little but helps the poor very much, no matter what ethnicity they are. In this way, zero \"discriminating\" is done in who is deemed \"worthy\" of reparations, and instead everyone is simultaneously pulled up from the bottom....which is where disenfranchised family lineages tend to end up anyway."}, {"id": "2qf9r3", "body": "I know there were a few posts about reparations but I don't think the arguments they were making were very compelling.\n\nFor context, this [forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/05/25/if-there-should-be-reparations-for-american-slavery-the-amount-should-be-around-about-nothing/) estimates the costs would be $70 billion, about that of the food stamp program, if we payed $1,600 per year to all descendents of slaves. I'm fine with doubling that cost since my plan probably includes more people.\n\nBut anyways, there's three main reasons I think we should do this:\n\n1. Moral/philosophical reasons: The US first put blacks through years of slavery. Then, in the Jim Crow south, their property was deliberately taken from them, often in ways that law enforcement would ignore or even support. But even after the Civil Rights act, the problems were still there. Many blacks were forced into lower-income neighborhoods. Many of them still received lower-quality education, not only because of segregation, but also because people didn't want to allocate resources to \"black areas.\" In addition to the fact that they don't have access to the networking that many whites did, I believe all of these made it so that blacks systematically were deprived of any shot at equality. The issue with this is that they all consented to the governance of the US just as much as the whites did, and deserved equal protection according to the constitution. When a government fails to fulfill the social contract, it has an obligation to attempt to correct for it, or else it is not a legitimate government that can be held to any sort of social contract or constitution.\n\n2. Economic/social reasons: I think this would at least be a meaningful step to economic equality for blacks. I think this is really important is because a lot of the reason racism is still alive today is because blacks tend to be around blacks and whites tend to be around whites, so there's no exposure to the other races. This makes it much easier to stereotype blacks as lazy, or thuggish, or less intelligent, whether the stereotypes are conscious or subconscious. If you give blacks more money, they have more access to education resources, which allows them to get to private schools, or better colleges, or better professions. The more blacks have access to these opportunities, the less that people are going to be able to stereotype them as thugs, or in less severe cases, subconsciously assume that blacks are of a poorer or less educated background. I think the latter is the source of most racism today, and that by getting more blacks in higher positions would solve it through exposure theory.\n\n3. Political reasons: I think it would be an important symbolic statement from the government. Many poor black communities are ravaged by crime because they have a sense of abandonment from the government, and feel less of an obligation to respect it.

Wade. \n\nYou don't pay train company that had to finance train cars before Plessy V. Ferguson. \n\nWhy should we make an exception for African-Americans"}, {"id": "2qf9r3", "body": "I know there were a few posts about reparations but I don't think the arguments they were making were very compelling.\n\nFor context, this [forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/05/25/if-there-should-be-reparations-for-american-slavery-the-amount-should-be-around-about-nothing/) estimates the costs would be $70 billion, about that of the food stamp program, if we payed $1,600 per year to all descendents of slaves. I'm fine with doubling that cost since my plan probably includes more people.\n\nBut anyways, there's three main reasons I think we should do this:\n\n1. Moral/philosophical reasons: The US first put blacks through years of slavery. Then, in the Jim Crow south, their property was deliberately taken from them, often in ways that law enforcement would ignore or even support. But even after the Civil Rights act, the problems were still there. Many blacks were forced into lower-income neighborhoods. Many of them still received lower-quality education, not only because of segregation, but also because people didn't want to allocate resources to \"black areas.\" In addition to the fact that they don't have access to the networking that many whites did, I believe all of these made it so that blacks systematically were deprived of any shot at equality. The issue with this is that they all consented to the governance of the US just as much as the whites did, and deserved equal protection according to the constitution. When a government fails to fulfill the social contract, it has an obligation to attempt to correct for it, or else it is not a legitimate government that can be held to any sort of social contract or constitution.\n\n2. Economic/social reasons: I think this would at least be a meaningful step to economic equality for blacks. I think this is really important is because a lot of the reason racism is still alive today is because blacks tend to be around blacks and whites tend to be around whites, so there's no exposure to the other races. This makes it much easier to stereotype blacks as lazy, or thuggish, or less intelligent, whether the stereotypes are conscious or subconscious. If you give blacks more money, they have more access to education resources, which allows them to get to private schools, or better colleges, or better professions. The more blacks have access to these opportunities, the less that people are going to be able to stereotype them as thugs, or in less severe cases, subconsciously assume that blacks are of a poorer or less educated background.

More than college, more than the latest novel, more than socializing, etc. I for one would drop everything to focus exclusively on it and any other action, given confidence in that knowledge, seems insane to me.\n\nIn this sense I feel like older religious traditions (Jewish Torah scholarship, Muslim memorization of the Quran, Christian monks secluding themselves for religious contemplation and study, etc.) which placed extreme emphasis on their holy books were acting far more rationally.\n\nTo give an analogy for how I feel, it would be like if I was sitting on reddit and a giant glowing hand burst through my bedroom wall and began to write a letter on my wall for me starting with \"Dear Bezant,\" and I just thought \"Ehhhh, I wonder if there's any funny new memes today?\" then a few days later asked my roommate if anything in the letter seared onto my wall seemed important.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the debate all! I'm heading to bed, but some further thoughts that occured to me while talking with everyone.\n\nHave sacred texts somehow entered the mundane realm by being such a fixture of everyday life, that the human mind for some reason almost always refuses to consider it remarkable, even if it genuinely believes it is the most unique thing on earth?\n\nI'll do my best to answer any new counterarguments tomorrow.\n\n**Edit 2:** Wow this is still at the top! \n\nI'll post /u/greygoop8's version here, I think he captured it in a way that doesn't evoke all the specific religious arguments:\n\n&gt;I don't know if you are really appreciating what it would mean to believe a text is sacred.\n\n&gt;Think of this scenario. You get contacted by an alien who takes you on a tour around the universe showing off technologies that look like magic to you and that break what you thought were the rules of the universe. They can manipulate time, space, energy and matter in ways you never imagined, nevermind thought possible. They tell you they've been around since before the big bang and have figured out how to survive the multiple heat deaths of the universe that they've already lived through. The knowledge they have about the universe makes your current knowledge look like that of an insect compared to a human.\n\n&gt;Then they give you a book, in your native language, that's about 1,000 pages, written in a way to try to help you better understand the universe and explain to you the greatest mysteries of life.\n\n&gt;How could you not devote all your energy to reading and studying that text until you know it inside and out?\n\n&gt;If I believed the bible was the direct word of an omnipotent being trying to give me a message, I wouldn't put it down. I don't know how anyone who actually believed a text was divine could do otherwise.\n\nSo, if you want to CMV, I would suggest arguing one of two points:\n\na) to the human mind, a religious text isn't 'divine' in the same way the alien's gift would be. \n\nb) a relatively disinterested reaction to such a gift is reasonable\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any time you take the results of others as fact you make an assumption and you are making a calculated choice to trust those who have tested it previously but that knowledge is obtainable firsthand if you're willing to put in the effort.\n\nI object to your assertion that it is \"required\" to trust other scientists unreasonably and that the trust that does exist in the community is \"blind.\" I personally have dedicated most of my life to understanding science and working to discover new things and I don't think any of that is \"blind trust\" and I resent that those who have not learned what I have outright reject science simply because they chose to devote their efforts to other things and do not understand it. I mean that's their choice I suppose but I resent that their uninformed *opinion* often hold the exact same weight as a well-researched, properly tested hypothesis.\n\ntl;dr: By definition you can test science.

"}, {"id": "cn6a1rb", "body": "&gt; I don't think it holds much merit when there was a time it was frowned upon and even considered against the law for many people to own a bible at all by Catholics.\n\nHey, nobody's saying Catholicism wasn't once the dominant religion in the known world, and that the people in power didn't use it, and the name of god, to further their selfish aims. I fully accept that restricting people's access to the original text is elitist and can be harmful; I'm saying that, for the reasons it's intended for, it's justified.\n\nActually, an interesting parallel can be drawn here to the world of science. The philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn developed his concept of scientific paradigm (which is modified now, but is still one of the pillars of modern philosophy of science) around the notion that the doing of science is built around some binding theory or world view (paradigm), which scientists believe in, because they can't by definition prove the entire thing beyond all doubt, and insulate from challenge by outsiders to the community. Paradigm shifts happen when a greater proportion of scientists starts believing in a new theory. A modern example would be how we used to think that matter was made up of many little particles, and then in the 70s people started talking about these particles behaving more like waves, and we got string theory. A more extreme example, from the past, would be when scientists believed in physiognomy - that a person's character (especially criminal intent) could be inferred from their facial features, aka people that looked more caveman-like were more aggressive and susceptible to base instincts, more likely to be criminal, aka that \"civilized\" Western values made people genetically superior. Now we have shifted towards a biochemical understanding of behavior.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that, unless you have sway in the scientific community, which is gained by excelling at and furthering science as it is, nobody's gonna let you challenge anything (the relevant distinction is that, at certain points in religious history, nobody would've let you even have access to the materials needed to justify a challenging view, or would have burned you at the stake for heresy etc etc, which doesn't happen in science - you just get ignored, which nets approximately the same benefit to society as you being burned at the stake).\n\n&gt; them understanding them and challenging them is wholeheartedly encouraged by the scientific community.\n\nThe more nuanced observation that them understanding them as they *should* be understood is encouraged by the community. \"Revolutionary\" scientific ideas are still treated like heresy until proven otherwise. Obviously I'm not talking about cranks here who misunderstand basic trigonometry, but there's plenty of these debates happening at the frontiers of the scientific fields I know about: consider loop quantum gravity, consider neo-Keynesianism (of which Pinketty, following *Capital in the 21st Century*, has been accused). There is definitely an emphasis in the scientific community on doing science as it should be done according to them and getting the results that they want. These issues are more prominent in some fields than in others, but it's incorrect to say that dogma, elitism, and bias do not exist in science."}, {"id": "cn5xdx8", "body": "I'm afraid secular academia (yes, including natural science) works in a very similar manner."}, {"id": "cn66vsz", "body": "Oh please, that's just melodramatic.

More than college, more than the latest novel, more than socializing, etc. I for one would drop everything to focus exclusively on it and any other action, given confidence in that knowledge, seems insane to me.\n\nIn this sense I feel like older religious traditions (Jewish Torah scholarship, Muslim memorization of the Quran, Christian monks secluding themselves for religious contemplation and study, etc.) which placed extreme emphasis on their holy books were acting far more rationally.\n\nTo give an analogy for how I feel, it would be like if I was sitting on reddit and a giant glowing hand burst through my bedroom wall and began to write a letter on my wall for me starting with \"Dear Bezant,\" and I just thought \"Ehhhh, I wonder if there's any funny new memes today?\" then a few days later asked my roommate if anything in the letter seared onto my wall seemed important.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the debate all! I'm heading to bed, but some further thoughts that occured to me while talking with everyone.\n\nHave sacred texts somehow entered the mundane realm by being such a fixture of everyday life, that the human mind for some reason almost always refuses to consider it remarkable, even if it genuinely believes it is the most unique thing on earth?\n\nI'll do my best to answer any new counterarguments tomorrow.\n\n**Edit 2:** Wow this is still at the top! \n\nI'll post /u/greygoop8's version here, I think he captured it in a way that doesn't evoke all the specific religious arguments:\n\n&gt;I don't know if you are really appreciating what it would mean to believe a text is sacred.\n\n&gt;Think of this scenario. You get contacted by an alien who takes you on a tour around the universe showing off technologies that look like magic to you and that break what you thought were the rules of the universe. They can manipulate time, space, energy and matter in ways you never imagined, nevermind thought possible. They tell you they've been around since before the big bang and have figured out how to survive the multiple heat deaths of the universe that they've already lived through. The knowledge they have about the universe makes your current knowledge look like that of an insect compared to a human.\n\n&gt;Then they give you a book, in your native language, that's about 1,000 pages, written in a way to try to help you better understand the universe and explain to you the greatest mysteries of life.\n\n&gt;How could you not devote all your energy to reading and studying that text until you know it inside and out?\n\n&gt;If I believed the bible was the direct word of an omnipotent being trying to give me a message, I wouldn't put it down. I don't know how anyone who actually believed a text was divine could do otherwise.\n\nSo, if you want to CMV, I would suggest arguing one of two points:\n\na) to the human mind, a religious text isn't 'divine' in the same way the alien's gift would be. \n\nb) a relatively disinterested reaction to such a gift is reasonable\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, not matter what you've done, you will gain eternal life\n\n2. Go to heaven\n\nObviously, there's a little more to this, and people like Paul talk about those who abuse Christ's death(i.e. say they're Christian but continually and purposefully commit sins like murder), but the central message is still the same. Even if someone believes is important, if you really want to go to the very basics, there isn't much to commit and spend time to, because the whole message is simply: Believe. That's it. Reading it more won't get you heaven, dedicating your whole life to learning about it won't get you to heaven. Only by believing and having faith is how you get to heaven.\n\nNow, the extension of this is yes, just like OP said, devotion and dedication to the the word of God, the Bible. To build a relationship with Christ(sounds weird, I know), or to truly become a 'Christian' you have to read your Bible and follow the example set by Christ. \n\nPaul does talk about people whom who are considered 'lukewarm Christians', who acknowledge Christ with their mouths, but deny Him with their lifes, and those are the people you're probably thinking about, OP.

More than college, more than the latest novel, more than socializing, etc. I for one would drop everything to focus exclusively on it and any other action, given confidence in that knowledge, seems insane to me.\n\nIn this sense I feel like older religious traditions (Jewish Torah scholarship, Muslim memorization of the Quran, Christian monks secluding themselves for religious contemplation and study, etc.) which placed extreme emphasis on their holy books were acting far more rationally.\n\nTo give an analogy for how I feel, it would be like if I was sitting on reddit and a giant glowing hand burst through my bedroom wall and began to write a letter on my wall for me starting with \"Dear Bezant,\" and I just thought \"Ehhhh, I wonder if there's any funny new memes today?\" then a few days later asked my roommate if anything in the letter seared onto my wall seemed important.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the debate all! I'm heading to bed, but some further thoughts that occured to me while talking with everyone.\n\nHave sacred texts somehow entered the mundane realm by being such a fixture of everyday life, that the human mind for some reason almost always refuses to consider it remarkable, even if it genuinely believes it is the most unique thing on earth?\n\nI'll do my best to answer any new counterarguments tomorrow.\n\n**Edit 2:** Wow this is still at the top! \n\nI'll post /u/greygoop8's version here, I think he captured it in a way that doesn't evoke all the specific religious arguments:\n\n&gt;I don't know if you are really appreciating what it would mean to believe a text is sacred.\n\n&gt;Think of this scenario. You get contacted by an alien who takes you on a tour around the universe showing off technologies that look like magic to you and that break what you thought were the rules of the universe. They can manipulate time, space, energy and matter in ways you never imagined, nevermind thought possible. They tell you they've been around since before the big bang and have figured out how to survive the multiple heat deaths of the universe that they've already lived through. The knowledge they have about the universe makes your current knowledge look like that of an insect compared to a human.\n\n&gt;Then they give you a book, in your native language, that's about 1,000 pages, written in a way to try to help you better understand the universe and explain to you the greatest mysteries of life.\n\n&gt;How could you not devote all your energy to reading and studying that text until you know it inside and out?\n\n&gt;If I believed the bible was the direct word of an omnipotent being trying to give me a message, I wouldn't put it down. I don't know how anyone who actually believed a text was divine could do otherwise.\n\nSo, if you want to CMV, I would suggest arguing one of two points:\n\na) to the human mind, a religious text isn't 'divine' in the same way the alien's gift would be. \n\nb) a relatively disinterested reaction to such a gift is reasonable\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Though I no longer practice, I grew up catholic, went to catholic school, the whole works: one of the things heavily taught was the importance of reflection.

You read a portion of the text, think it over, think of how it impacts your life, think of the context of the time period and social issues and why god said it, how it relates to the sacraments, etc. \n\nThe main point being that you gain SOME understanding of the scriptures through study and reading. But should you not reflect on it and attempt to apply it in a practical way it is meaningless. Think of a cookbook- you could read a cookbook and have a theoretical knowledge of how to cook, but until you actually make the recipe with success the knowledge isn't useful.\n\nAs for the cover to cover comment, the bible was not meant to be read cover to cover as it is a collection of many different stories from different authors and time periods and contexts. You generally wouldn't read a encyclopedia from cover to cover either. However, over time, as you take in all the pieces, it becomes a whole and you will (assuming you're practicing) get to all of the stories. I never read my college calculus book from cover to cover but I can put the topics covered in it to practical use- to the point that I would say I know calculus. \n\nTo address your original CMV, remember that, at least in Catholicism, lay people believe in the infallibility of the pope and point to certain parts of the New Testament to back it up. Meaning that they believe the pope was in fact given the ability to interpret scripture from god himself and is acting according to his will. Catholic dogma contains MUCH more than just the bible. Similarly, as the pope ordains cardinals who ordain bishops and so on: it is often the belief that these people are in fact interpreting the bible through God himself and would have a better understanding than a lay person ever could.\n\nI know that my explanation is full of on the spot metaphors that may have potential holes.\n\nTL;DR- 1) there is emphasis on the idea that reflection leads to understanding, 2) belief that the bible isn't meant to be read cover to cover 3) papal infallibility is a reason many Catholics do not devote more time to study\n\nSource: ex-catholic "}, {"id": "cn5mcqt", "body": "I think this is a decent answer.

If you just study it and don't do anything about it, your faith is fruitless and dead."}, {"id": "cn5m6xz", "body": "Reading passages often, learning about it during mass each week, and attending a bible study weekly are things most of the christians I know do. That is more studying than I have ever done for anything, lol"}, {"id": "cn5rj3w", "body": "Most Christians don't do that in my experience. "}, {"id": "2qf2pw", "body": "I find it very very strange that religious people (of any denomination, but I primarily encounter Christians) claim to believe that their text is sacred, directly created or somehow influenced by God, and not merely a divine post-it note or shopping list, but instructions on life and so on, yet very few of them commit any serious amount of time to reading or learning about it. \n\nI feel that most religious people (and by that I mean people who genuinely believe in it all) fall into these categories:\n\n* Cultural absorption: My community believes in the Bible, so as long as I act with the values taught in my community that's good enough.\n* \n* Knowledge by proxy: I'll let someone else tell me about it, they're probably more capable of telling me what it means anyway.\n\nIf someone actually felt an object was sacred, it would be immeasurably more important and valuable than anything else in the world. More than college, more than the latest novel, more than socializing, etc. I for one would drop everything to focus exclusively on it and any other action, given confidence in that knowledge, seems insane to me.\n\nIn this sense I feel like older religious traditions (Jewish Torah scholarship, Muslim memorization of the Quran, Christian monks secluding themselves for religious contemplation and study, etc.) which placed extreme emphasis on their holy books were acting far more rationally.\n\nTo give an analogy for how I feel, it would be like if I was sitting on reddit and a giant glowing hand burst through my bedroom wall and began to write a letter on my wall for me starting with \"Dear Bezant,\" and I just thought \"Ehhhh, I wonder if there's any funny new memes today?\" then a few days later asked my roommate if anything in the letter seared onto my wall seemed important.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the debate all! I'm heading to bed, but some further thoughts that occured to me while talking with everyone.\n\nHave sacred texts somehow entered the mundane realm by being such a fixture of everyday life, that the human mind for some reason almost always refuses to consider it remarkable, even if it genuinely believes it is the most unique thing on earth?\n\nI'll do my best to answer any new counterarguments tomorrow.\n\n**Edit 2:** Wow this is still at the top! \n\nI'll post /u/greygoop8's version here, I think he captured it in a way that doesn't evoke all the specific religious arguments:\n\n&gt;I don't know if you are really appreciating what it would mean to believe a text is sacred.\n\n&gt;Think of this scenario. You get contacted by an alien who takes you on a tour around the universe showing off technologies that look like magic to you and that break what you thought were the rules of the universe. They can manipulate time, space, energy and matter in ways you never imagined, nevermind thought possible. They tell you they've been around since before the big bang and have figured out how to survive the multiple heat deaths of the universe that they've already lived through. The knowledge they have about the universe makes your current knowledge look like that of an insect compared to a human.\n\n&gt;Then they give you a book, in your native language, that's about 1,000 pages, written in a way to try to help you better understand the universe and explain to you the greatest mysteries of life.\n\n&gt;How could you not devote all your energy to reading and studying that text until you know it inside and out?\n\n&gt;If I believed the bible was the direct word of an omnipotent being trying to give me a message, I wouldn't put it down. I don't know how anyone who actually believed a text was divine could do otherwise.\n\nSo, if you want to CMV, I would suggest arguing one of two points:\n\na) to the human mind, a religious text isn't 'divine' in the same way the alien's gift would be. \n\nb) a relatively disinterested reaction to such a gift is reasonable\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

None of them were wrong.\n\nThere is yet another fringe group that believe, not thinks, just.... freaking believes, that the actual name of god can be mathematically decoded from the torah and once discovered it will bring about the true second coming. There was an independant film in the 80's about it, I think.\n\nSo there are some examples of people other than christians dedicating serious time to study and not playing WoW. But the New Covenant that brought about christianity removed all of the minutiae of intense study by the follower and placed that burden on the shepherds, or preachers. The first examples of this is Paul's letters. It amazes me that so few people know how the bible was actually put together and even fewer know that Paul's letters were just that... letters to followers in other cities and churches. Their pastor knows, or should know. But the bottom line is, their \"Shepherd\" tells them... \n\n\"Obey the 10 commandments, accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior and you will make the cut for heaven. Now if you want some extra credit... go do good works because you love god and give what you can so others can do good works too and when you get to heaven god will reward you.\"\n\nWhat they hear is:\n\n1. Obey the 10 commandments but if you don't Jesus already died for that sin so just ask for forgiveness.\n2. Accept Jesus as your personal lord and savior and you are golden.\n3. In case of any confusion, see rule number one.\n\nSee it is not about studying texts for revelation, it's doing 2 things on a list of requirements to get to heaven.

The concept of \"just believing\" is quite a modern concept. As a historian (working on my PhD) who studies religion in North America from 1600-1865,  the bible and being able to read it had been a very important in American culture at least til 1865 no matter where you went in the US states. Puritans in the NE colonies used the bible as form of rudimentary education in literacy. If you could read the bible, that meant you were literate. In the south and Caribbean isles slaves used the bible to attain their freedom in many cases such as the case study of Rebecca Protten (J. Sensbach, Jon. *Rebecca's Revival: Creating Black Christianity in the Atlantic World*. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2006). The concept of casual belief is pretty alien in early America, and its something I have never come across in my research. If you were a believer, and could read, you likely knew your bible. \n\nThough to say that there were not droughts in religious fervor would be wrong. There were lulls and great periods of religious fervor in what are known as Great Awakenings. One of the most famous preachers in MA was Jonathan Edwards who is widely known for his \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\" sermon during the early mid 18th century (1741 to be more specific). He was a preacher during the First Great Awakening, a religious revival that may have been deliberately engineered. A great text that examines the effects of the 1GA is *Sarah Osborn's World* by Catherine Brekus. \n\nThen you have the Second Great Awakening in the Burned-Over District (Rochester, NY) during the 1830s. This is where you get the LDS, Millerites, and whole bunch of other groups. But what is interesting is how these new groups got previously non religious people to go to church and study the bible. Alcohol and vagrancy was a huge problem as workers began to migrate out of the work place and into what can be considered proto-neighbourhoods or boroughs. Bosses could no longer control their workers outside of the workplace and immoral actions such as alcoholism gambling became widespread. In order to regain that lost control and clean up their workers, bosses universally would demand that their workers did not drink and went to church. It is an amazing example of self-regulation within an industry, as opposed to regulation by the government. Here it is you see the first seeds of the temperance movement in what would lead to Prohibition. You also see some proto-marxist concepts emerging 20 years before Marx and Engels published the Communist Manifesto. (E. Johnson, Paul. *A Shopkeepers Millennium: Society and Revivals in Rochester, New York, 1815-1837*. New York: Hill and Wang, 2004.)\n\nSo what you have up until the American Civil War and at least about a decade after is a society where people who were religious and were literate did study their bible. The decrease in Bible study shows a trend of decline in the emergence of the 20th cent. Religion of America since 1865 is not my field of expertise but I could attribute lack of bible study on a cultural and societal level to things like the emergence of pop-religions like spiritualism, scientific discoveries, televangelism in the 1960s, the Cold War, and spread of information technology. But America is still deeply religious on a cultural level, always has been since the time of the colonies, and will be for a long time.
