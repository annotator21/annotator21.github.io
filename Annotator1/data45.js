The male isn't really encouraged to engage in more risky behavior since it's obvious whether he is wearing a condom or not, and the female can refuse to have sex if she knows he's not protected and/or she knows she's not regular on her birth control.

Right now, women do not have incentive to choose partners wisely because either the man will be on the hook for the costs, or she can get help from the state (from the man's taxes, so he's still paying). And given how much society (I believe completely wrongly) worships single moms instead of demonizing them for making poor choices, women are willing to become single moms far too easily. \n\nGiven how rough being a child of a single parent (which are overwhelmingly moms) is on statistical outcomes, we want to incentivize as much as possible having women choose good, stable men, who will stick around, to have kids with. If the woman is left on her own to face her poor decision of breeding with a bad guy, only able to rely on friends and family for assistance, she will be more careful with who she chooses to have sex with.\n\nLetting men opt out of paying for kids they don't want is a solution that assigns responsibility to the woman for her choices, instead of letting her off the hook to a large degree.\n"}, {"id": "cn3v5nh", "body": "&gt; I think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it.

It would probably be a very bad idea to implement it in the South of the USA, for example.\n\nSo CMV that this law is feasible. I would like people to discuss loopholes, extenuating circumstances and also if this law would be unfair to women in any way.

He has more responsibility for the child than society does so he should pay more than society.\n\nHe did that part, but had no choice in it's creation, that's the most important part. Choice brings responsibility. For women they have birth control pills, condoms, if one of those fails they can abort, if they choice not to then they can unwilling bring the father into to take  major financial responsibilities for their choice. Where as men have condoms or invasive surgery, one of which can break or fail, then they are screwed financially for the next 18, now since the last half can be fixed by society. I hate how people say that they are putting the burden on society. The women who get pregnant get to decide, not the men.

Do you not see a difference between abortions and signing away legal rights?\n\nIt's not, but the woman shouldn't be solely relying on his birth control and should have her own, in that case it was indeed a non reckless accident.\n\n&gt;It's not about the mother, it's about the kid and what happens to them. \n\nThen \n\n&gt;I think that the man has more responsibility than society so either A or B seem like the best options to me.\n\nYou've put responsibility on the man despite him having no choice, when the woman does. You can say, abortion is a hard decision, but I'd rather have a hard decision than not be able to have a decision at all and be stuck with the consequences of someone's else for 18 years.\n\nYou situations for B, C, and D don't change if the women becomes a poor couple. The person deciding on whether they should get abortion or give it up for adoption or keep is needs to decide by themselves if they have the financial resources to raise it. Not the people who don't have a say. Unless you can change my opinion that women shouldn't have the choice to decide if both parties should be responsible I don't think we're going to get anywhere. \n\n\n"}, {"id": "2q8fd1", "body": "I'll define a financial abortion as : Giving up the parental rights to a child you fathered. It involves not having to pay child support.\n\nI've seen this concept floating around and initially dismissed it completely as guys wanting to shirk responsibility and be deadbeats. I also thought it could be too easily exploited, especially if men got cold feet about having a baby and, after claiming to support the woman, decided to screw her over by taking the financial abortion option.\n\nHowever I've thought up ways in which such a law could actually be feasible.\n\n1. If intending to get child support from the father of a child, the woman MUST inform him as soon as possible about the state of her being pregnant, at least by the 8th week. Maybe he can sign a document saying he knows she's pregnant.\n\n2. The father can only decide to opt out and have the financial abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy. If he doesn't opt out by then, he loses the right to opt out. (The 10 week thing is because pregnancy is pretty obvious by then but the woman's body hasn't been morphed much it looks like. This can be changed, I just based it off looking at pictures.)\n\nThese laws mean that a woman can decide, with plenty of time left over for contemplating abortion, if she wants to keep a baby and raise it as a single mom. If she can't raise it on her own she might want to abort, with no great medical risk compared to the risks of pregnancy.\n\nI think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it. I think it is also immoral to force a man to pay for a child he didn't want. If a woman can't raise the child without the father's support the moral thing to do would be to abort the child.\n\nThis law would obviously be relying on abortion being freely available in the area. It would probably be a very bad idea to implement it in the South of the USA, for example.\n\nSo CMV that this law is feasible. I would like people to discuss loopholes, extenuating circumstances and also if this law would be unfair to women in any way. I would also REALLY appreciate it if people explained why they think this is distasteful along with their down vote.

When you look at abortion you see bodily autonomy only, it looks like. I see a way women can 'cop out' of having a child, along with bodily autonomy. Why do you refuse to view it as opting out of having a child? At least in some cases, that is the sole reason for having abortion, no? It is a 100% solution to having the burden of a child.\n\n&gt;Let's say you throw my phone off a cliff into the sea.\n\nI don't think your analogy is very valid though. Once the phone is thrown the woman has no control over the phone at all, only the wind does. For it to be controllable the woman should be able to catch the phone somehow, she can decide if she wants to catch it or not. In the case of pregnancy the woman absolutely has control over the future child.\n\n&gt;you decided to do something that got her pregnant in the first place. There might be due to something you did.

You keep denying this.\n\nOk I will try to lay out my thought process here so it is clearer.\n\n1. Two people have consensual sex. Both accept risk of pregnancy. Both responsible if pregnancy is caused. 50/50.\n\n2. Woman has choice: Keep or not keep baby. Man has no choice. Woman has 100% choice, man has 0% choice. 100/0\n\n3.

Once the phone is thrown the woman has no control over the phone at all, only the wind does.

We're solidly in 'holiday season': where we go from Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve in a matter of 4-5 weeks. After the 'holiday season' ends, we have no major holidays until April, one in July, and one (minor) at the end of October. Our holidays are too jumbled up!\n\nTo clarify, it seems to me that there are holidays that are 'major' (many people are given a day off, most people celebrate in some way, children out of school) and some that are 'minor' (only celebrated by some people, most businesses open and staffed normally, children in school). In my view, they are:\n\n**Major Holidays**\n\n* Christmas (day)\n* Thanksgiving\n* Easter\n* New Year's (Eve, and day)\n* 4th of July\n\n**Minor Holidays**\n\n* Valentine's Day\n* MLK Day\n* President's Day\n* Mother's Day\n* Father's Day\n* Memorial Day\n* Labor Day\n* Veteran's Day\n* Halloween\n\nI'm not asserting that any one holiday is more important than any other, or that the 'minor' holidays are not celebrated - the holidays I listed as 'major' are simply the most widely acknowledged. In fact, you could pare the list of 'major' holidays down to only Thanksgiving and Christmas and the point would still stand: it makes no sense to have them so close together!\n\nThe date of Thanksgiving is completely arbitrary. The holiday was established by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Prior to Lincoln's establishment, harvest festivals were traditionally celebrated in Western societies, but occurred closer to the Autumnal equinox. The end of November is too late for a harvest festival. Many evangelical and fundamentalist Christians have already re-purposed Halloween into a harvest festival, which (date-wise) makes much more sense than celebrating the harvest at the end of November. \n\nIn western societies, we still mark solstices and equinoxes - though we've re-purposed their meaning. The date of Easter is always the first full moon after the spring equinox, Christmas is a few days after the winter solstice, and Halloween retains much of it's traditional meaning - even though the date has changed. But we do nothing to celebrate the summer solstice. If we're going to move Thanksgiving, the last Thursday in June is close enough to the solstice (as close as is Christmas) to make sense. \n\nMoving Thanksgiving close to the summer solstice accomplishes several things. It spreads the (major) holidays throughout the year, so that workers who only get Thanksgiving and Christmas as holidays off get a second break mid-way through the years. It would allow people who travel for the holidays to do so with fewer weather delays, and eliminate the need to take additional vacations so close together. It would allow families in colder climates to eat and cook outside - letting them accommodate more family and friends. It would eliminate the need for a 'Thanksgiving break' in schools (since Thanksgiving would occur during summer vacation): allowing for more instruction time. The longest day of the year would facilitate all sorts of activity - Thanksgiving would no longer be the traditional 'eat a lot and watch football' day: but would be more conducive to playing games, telling stories, and visiting friends. \n\nAnother point I should address is the emergence of Black Friday as a holiday event. Personally, I *hate* this new tradition. This year, several of my family members left the house immediately after Thanksgiving dinner to go stand in line for Black Friday deals, leaving the rest of us. I understand that Black Friday is important for retailers, but it doesn't need Thanksgiving to exist. We could still 'celebrate' Black Friday as the last Friday (or Saturday might be easier) in November as the beginning of the Christmas buying season. The existence of Black Friday has really cheapened the Thanksgiving experience for me; the Thanksgiving holiday seems to have become a prelude to Black Friday. Moving Thanksgiving to the last Thursday in June decouples it from the Black Friday, allowing Thanksgiving to stand on it's own as a holiday. \n\nThanksgiving is, perhaps, my favorite holiday of the year. As a non-Christians, Thanksgiving is a chance to get together with family, eat good food and drink good wine, and be given time off from work. But it's always hard to travel in late November, to take additional days off for Christmas and Thanksgiving so close together, and to contend with the commercialism that follows immediately after the Thanksgiving table is cleared. Summer is always an easier time of year to do *anything*: kids are out of school, travel is easy, and vacationing is expected. Our society would do well to have a major holiday during the summer - rather than both major holidays during the winter months. Christmas and New Year's Eve are enough to give us a 'bump' during the long, dark, boring winter months - let's move Thanksgiving to the summer time, enjoy the comfort and ease of the summer months, and spread our holidays more evenly throughout the year. \n\nTo change my view: convince me why Thanksgiving is ideally placed where it is, or why we don't need a major holiday in the summertime. Alternately, convince me that the benefits we gain by moving Thanksgiving to June don't outweigh the benefits we gain by keeping the holiday where it is.\n\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Wouldn't that lump our holidays just as bad? \n\nMy personal opinion is not that we should move our holidays around to better spread them but that we should invent new ones so there is at least one per month. Like canada does. \n\nUnrelated but I take issue with Memorial Day and Labor Day as minor holidays while Easter is called out as major. Easter is always a sunday and doesn't affect most workers, it also isn't a national holiday. Memorial Day and Labor Day are national holidays and most workers get them off. It just happens that The reverse is true of most retail employment (no Easter work but sales on memorial and labor days).

You make some fine points.  I have only three that I'd like you to consider.  I know it's anecdotal for the most part, but I sincerely wouldn't want to see Thankgiving in. June or summer.\n\n1.  Personally, I love having these breaks (thanksgiving, Xmas, and New years) so close together.  This is my favorite part of the year because of the quick series of breaks.   Even the workplace is abuzz with the coming breaks and is generally more relaxed.   My friends and family can and do use their personal/vacation days during the summer to help balance the obviously lopsided breaks.  (no question there)\n\n2.  From what I gather, the U.S. average worker puts in more hours of work to maintain their standard of living than many other developed nations.  I would rather instill in our youth (students) that it's better to work smarter with the time that has been given to you than harder.  Taking breaks away from them implies that it would just be more of the same educational policies.  Taking away breaks during the school year sends the future the memo that more of the same is what we need in schools and, perhaps indirectly, the current business world.  I don't like either model,  but that's an argument for anther day.\n\n3.  Have you ever cooked a traditional Thansgiving meal in Summer?  Dude.  The heat that is thrown from the kitchen and the aromas that run through the sealed home in late November is a highlight that would be lost for many families if we moved the feast fest to hotter months.  This last point is non-negotiable IMHO.  Imagine it being 90 plus, hazy, hot and humid and expected to either cook a traditional thanksgiving meal or even eating one.  Neither sounds enjoyable.

The holidays *are* a low-productivity time - precisely because there are so many of them grouped together. Productivity doesn't drop off precipitously in July due to the 4th, or in April because of Easter. But getting hit with Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's all within 5 weeks *does* diminish productivity. Christmas has a traditional basis far, far older than the US, and the New Year will always be Dec 31st/Jan 1st, so let's move the arbitrary holiday and squeeze out an extra week or two of productivity.\n\n&gt; In the USA we tend to view holidays as commercial events which tend to spur a boost in the economy. If we were to move Thanksgiving to the middle of the year (or roundabouts) we would likely end up suffering from \"holiday creep\" even earlier in the year.\n\nI partially addressed this in my OP, when I suggested that Black Friday could be a 'holiday' in and of itself - it doesn't *need* Thanksgiving to work. As for the things that are bought for Thanksgiving (food, alcohol, etc.) - I work as a wholesale sales rep and sell these things to retailers and restaurants. Let me tell you: those businesses would *love* to have a bump in sales in the middle of the year. As it stands, many businesses are forced to make the majority of their revenues during the 'holiday season', and starve for the rest of the year. Given the choice, I think those businesses would rather see two smaller bumps equally spaced throughout the year than one big bump once per year.\n\n&gt; Do you really want to live in a world that has Halloween stuff up for display on July 5th(right after Independence Day stuff comes down), and Christmas stuff up on November 1st?\n\nAren't we already seeing this? Before I got into wholesale, I worked in retail sales. Holiday displays go up earlier and earlier every year: just like businesses open up earlier and earlier on Black Friday (or Thanksgiving) every year. I don't know that moving Thanksgiving will change seeing Christmas items in stores on Nov 1st: I'm sure that'll be happening in the next few years. Further, I don't think 'retail creep' is enough of a reason to invalidate the benefits I stated in my OP. If enough people object to 'retail creep': it won't happen.

The date of Easter is always the first full moon after the spring equinox, Christmas is a few days after the winter solstice, and Halloween retains much of it's traditional meaning - even though the date has changed. But we do nothing to celebrate the summer solstice. If we're going to move Thanksgiving, the last Thursday in June is close enough to the solstice (as close as is Christmas) to make sense. \n\nMoving Thanksgiving close to the summer solstice accomplishes several things. It spreads the (major) holidays throughout the year, so that workers who only get Thanksgiving and Christmas as holidays off get a second break mid-way through the years. It would allow people who travel for the holidays to do so with fewer weather delays, and eliminate the need to take additional vacations so close together. It would allow families in colder climates to eat and cook outside - letting them accommodate more family and friends. It would eliminate the need for a 'Thanksgiving break' in schools (since Thanksgiving would occur during summer vacation): allowing for more instruction time. The longest day of the year would facilitate all sorts of activity - Thanksgiving would no longer be the traditional 'eat a lot and watch football' day: but would be more conducive to playing games, telling stories, and visiting friends. \n\nAnother point I should address is the emergence of Black Friday as a holiday event. Personally, I *hate* this new tradition. This year, several of my family members left the house immediately after Thanksgiving dinner to go stand in line for Black Friday deals, leaving the rest of us. I understand that Black Friday is important for retailers, but it doesn't need Thanksgiving to exist. We could still 'celebrate' Black Friday as the last Friday (or Saturday might be easier) in November as the beginning of the Christmas buying season. The existence of Black Friday has really cheapened the Thanksgiving experience for me; the Thanksgiving holiday seems to have become a prelude to Black Friday. Moving Thanksgiving to the last Thursday in June decouples it from the Black Friday, allowing Thanksgiving to stand on it's own as a holiday. \n\nThanksgiving is, perhaps, my favorite holiday of the year. As a non-Christians, Thanksgiving is a chance to get together with family, eat good food and drink good wine, and be given time off from work. But it's always hard to travel in late November, to take additional days off for Christmas and Thanksgiving so close together, and to contend with the commercialism that follows immediately after the Thanksgiving table is cleared. Summer is always an easier time of year to do *anything*: kids are out of school, travel is easy, and vacationing is expected. Our society would do well to have a major holiday during the summer - rather than both major holidays during the winter months. Christmas and New Year's Eve are enough to give us a 'bump' during the long, dark, boring winter months - let's move Thanksgiving to the summer time, enjoy the comfort and ease of the summer months, and spread our holidays more evenly throughout the year. \n\nTo change my view: convince me why Thanksgiving is ideally placed where it is, or why we don't need a major holiday in the summertime. Alternately, convince me that the benefits we gain by moving Thanksgiving to June don't outweigh the benefits we gain by keeping the holiday where it is.\n\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "cn3wow1", "body": "I, too, have family close to my wife and I and family far away. We, also, trade off holidays: one holiday with her folks and one with mine. We alternate holidays - one with her parents (5 hours drive away) and one with mine (in the same town we live in).\n\nYou've hit on the genesis of this CMV: we live in the very far north US, and travelling for either Thanksgiving or Christmas is always difficult. Driving to Montana in November is just as difficult as driving to Montana in December. Both holidays are important, and it's not fair to say \"we're always going to spend X with my folks and Y with yours\", so we alternate every year. \n\nIf Thanksgiving was in June, we could easily choose to travel to see her parents then, and spend every Christmas here in town with my family. The ease of logistics would trump missing Christmas with her family. As it stands, every time we travel for the holidays: it's a dangerous chore. \n\nWe don't have children, but we also don't have jobs that can spare us for arbitrary periods during the year. Our vacation time has to be dedicated to weddings, reunions, graduations, etc. A broadly accepted summer holiday would give us the option to travel when it is safe and convenient: instead of giving us time off during the worst times of the year for travel. Consider low-wage workers, small-business owners, private contractors, and other professionals who do not have the privilege of guaranteed vacation time. A summer holiday would guarantee that these people enjoy the same benefit to summer vacation that higher-wage workers enjoy by default. "}, {"id": "2q7vdy", "body": "As we approach another major Western holiday, it occurs to me that the distribution of holidays throughout the year is really unbalanced. We're solidly in 'holiday season': where we go from Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve in a matter of 4-5 weeks. After the 'holiday season' ends, we have no major holidays until April, one in July, and one (minor) at the end of October. Our holidays are too jumbled up!\n\nTo clarify, it seems to me that there are holidays that are 'major' (many people are given a day off, most people celebrate in some way, children out of school) and some that are 'minor' (only celebrated by some people, most businesses open and staffed normally, children in school). In my view, they are:\n\n**Major Holidays**\n\n* Christmas (day)\n* Thanksgiving\n* Easter\n* New Year's (Eve, and day)\n* 4th of July\n\n**Minor Holidays**\n\n* Valentine's Day\n* MLK Day\n* President's Day\n* Mother's Day\n* Father's Day\n* Memorial Day\n* Labor Day\n* Veteran's Day\n* Halloween\n\nI'm not asserting that any one holiday is more important than any other, or that the 'minor' holidays are not celebrated - the holidays I listed as 'major' are simply the most widely acknowledged. In fact, you could pare the list of 'major' holidays down to only Thanksgiving and Christmas and the point would still stand: it makes no sense to have them so close together!\n\nThe date of Thanksgiving is completely arbitrary. The holiday was established by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Prior to Lincoln's establishment, harvest festivals were traditionally celebrated in Western societies, but occurred closer to the Autumnal equinox. The end of November is too late for a harvest festival. Many evangelical and fundamentalist Christians have already re-purposed Halloween into a harvest festival, which (date-wise) makes much more sense than celebrating the harvest at the end of November. \n\nIn western societies, we still mark solstices and equinoxes - though we've re-purposed their meaning.

While most racism in hiring is white against black and that sort of thing, I doubt that there isn't at least a few black people to refuse a white person a job based on race.\n\n&gt;Also, as a side note, age can make certain crimes worse. For example, if an 18 year old has sex with a 17 year old then this could be considered statutory rape in some states, as would a 60 year old having sex with a 17 year old. Which do you think is worse? Or do you think that both are the same?\n\nAdmittedly, I don't know how to counter this. The best I can say for these kinds of things is I guess release the ages? I think in my original post I mentioned how age could factor in to some crimes and that age would need to be declared."}, {"id": "cn3y0op", "body": "Reading testimony greatly decreased the ability of the judicial system to figure out truth.

Will there undeniably be intense backlash because it was a black man? I won't lie, there most likely will be. Jurries can be extremely biased even though they are supposed to be neutral. another example is sexual assault against men. I know, it isn't incredibly common, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. frankly, I don't think it matters on the gender. I think that courts should not disclose name, age(I'm a little iffy on this one, so it may be necessary.), race, or gender because frankly, it doesn't make the crimes any worse. why is it worse for a white man to kill a black man than the other way around? same goes for sexual assault.

Those that don't like the obnoxious tone that the subreddit gives off won't bother to downvote the low-quality spam that gets posted as it takes bothering to subscribe, and intelligent discussion gets buried as a result.\n\nI can't say I see this as an issue. Subreddits are meant to be their own distinct, autonomous communities. They aren't obligated to cater to temporary visitors, and if a particular subreddit wants to take efforts to best ensure that only those who are invested in that community contribute, more power to them. This is only a step down from a private subreddit, which is an official feature of the site. Neither of these presents a case of voting manipulating - only community access, which is fair game. If you don't like a certain community, reddit has a simple answer: don't go there.\n\n&gt;It also acts as a way to fake the size of the subreddit in order to claim ranks. Those who want to vote may subscribe and forget. Bots that exist to vote(let's face it, they exist) will subscribe, further inflating the subscriber count.\n\nThis is a grey area, as artificially inflating subscriber counts could potentially be an issue. However, many subreddits *cosmetically* alter their subscriber counts, and while not quite the same thing, neither the rules of the site nor the admins have had anything to say on it. In the end, subscriber counts are only really useful for the community, and to a limited extent. The benefits of a subreddit being able to regulate itself to a greater extent outweigh the cost of potential effects on the subscriber count that it otherwise would not receive.\n\n&gt;IMO if the subreddit refuses to comply it should be banned for spam, as it serves little purpose when /r/pcgaming exists as well.\n\nYou can't spam subreddits. Each one, as said, is its own distinct and near-sovereign creation. In fact, it is part of the design of the subreddit system that multiple subreddits on the same topic may exist as they may serve different communities and interests. Look at /r/startrek and /r/DaystromInstitute. Or /r/doctorwho and /r/gallifrey. Or /r/tolkienfans and /r/lotr, /r/thehobbit, and /r/lordoftherings amongst others.

His only argument has been that it just doesn't make sense to him. Even saying it doesn't always make sense to me didn't help. \n\nDespite this, he's been asking what I want to be called and such. Since I don't need any changes to be comfortable, I've asked him repeatedly to forget it, but he won't. At this point it may be easiest if you convince me I'm wrong. I wouldn't mind arguments to either side, so fire away. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
