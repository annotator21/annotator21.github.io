There is a lot of judgment involved - when to change lanes, when to turn, how to turn to park without hitting the cars in between the space, knowing you can kill someone.  A misjudgment can cause an accident.  You were turning right, you didn't see the person crossing the street, you hit them, they're dead.  There's also the matter of what a car CAN DO.  We all know it's a weapon that kills.  I think that's stuck in the back of your mind, but you can't kill someone with your body when walking.  Technically yes, if you're a murderer, but the regular person can't kill someone walking, but they sure can do that by driving.\n\nBut walking, you're just chilling.  What responsibility is there?  You're just walking.  You can't exactly kill someone by walking, even if you run full speed at them.  If you look both ways, cross the street, and still get hit, it wasn't your fault.  You aren't responsible for anything, at least none that I can think of.\n\nSo I'm guessing you don't like all the responsibility that comes with driving, especially when you say so many small actions can lead to disaster."}, {"id": "cngqac1", "body": "&amp;#8710; TBH, the fact that by this metric walking is more dangerous than driving blows my mind.

For example, a child who has never been exposed to sufficient emotional information will be unable to develop the neural networks necessary to process it. This is evident when comparing children raised in environments where emotions are frequently being acknowledged and discussed or not, and also children who have been neglected. Although training can improve it somewhat, if they are too old they will basically never be able to process emotions normally. Often they suffer Alexithymia as a consequence as well."}, {"id": "2rjrj6", "body": "It seems like it isn't uncommon for people to resort to using \"lack of empathy\" as an insult, especially when discussing social issues.  It's my understanding that empathy is largely an immutable personality trait that has little to no component of personal choice involved.\n\nTrying to shame someone for not being empathetic is no different than trying to shame someone for any other innate trait of who they are, be it sexuality, race, or physical size.\n\nI personally see the act as even worse when it comes up during conversations regarding social issues because it's most likely to be said by someone who would condemn insulting someone based on some part of themselves they can't control.\n\nFrom a perspective of social power, I will go ahead and point out that shaming those who lack empathy is an institutionalized process that comes from the idea of empathy being fundamentally good, as opposed to it just being one aspect of the human personality.\n\nSo...

If i believe strongly about something, I may not care as much about the feelings of the people I'm talking to.  That goes double for times when the people get upset Because of the opinion I feel strongly about.  \n \nThe thing about this though is that on the rare occasion I hurt someone's feelings, it is calculated.  It is not always the best thing to have too much empathy and it is not always the best thing to be too blunt. Sometimes they are the best thing, and more often than not, it is best to find a balance. \n\nSeeing as you are admiting to being called a bad person and having low empathy, it makes me believe that you are not always accurate in this calculation. I'm sure I'm not either, but since I feel empathy for others, I just have another piece of information to go by when making the calculation.  You unfortunately don't, and I don't judge you for it. But in spite of me not judging you personally, the chances are high that you needlessly hurt people's feelings too much.  People don't like it when you hurt their feelings even when you have a good reason, so when you seemingly do not, they like it even less.  \n\nInsofar as someone shaming you can spare someone's feelings that would otherwise be hurt unnecessarily, shaming had a positive impact on the world. Ofcourse, there are degrees to which it can be necessary or useful to be blunt also, so I have no easy answer for how you \"should\" respond to the shaming, or how you should talk. \n\nBut that doesn't mean it is analogous to shaming a gay or black person.  You can't stop being gay or black by shaming and there is no reason to do so. You can pretend to care about other people's feelings though and many times, there is a good reason to do so.  \n\nIt would be great if everyone could just be who they naturally are, but this right ends where it interferes with other people's right.  Some extreme examples to prove my point are that murder and child molestation shouldn't be allowed, even if a person naturally has a desire to kill or is naturally attracted to kids.  \n\nYou don't seem to be anywhere near this camp, but I do believe it is on the spectrum of harmful things that are worthy of a degree of shame.

Like with many things, including sexually, you have some rare outliers who are at either end of the spectrum and the vast majority in the middle somewhere. If you are at an end you are unlikely to move much, if at all, but anyone in the middle can move through their life experiences. \n\nFor example, some men and women are 100% straight and would never find the same sex attractive. Some are 100% homosexual and would never find the opposite gender attractive. But the bulk of people are in the spectrum and can move due to culture and experience. An example of this is Greece in general and specifically Sparta, where homosexuality was the norm and men had sex with women for procreation but with men for love and fun.

DoodleKaboodie seems to confuse the meaning of listening to something and hearing something. You can hear music but not listen to it, just as you can see something but not observe it. For example, how many times in your everyday life did you stop in the street, close your eyes and simply listen to every sound there's produced while trying to \"divide\"/categorize them in your mind? Even the sound of boiling water in compination with a car passin by can be fascinating if you listen to it rather than just hear it. You use your self phone every day, will you understand that  the order of some icons in the welcome screen is different and how exactly different if someone change it? I guess no. This is what I mean by saying listening to music rather than just hearing it, I mean devoting your 100% of your mind in appreciating the sounds that you hear. Lack of concentration is really common nowadays, I can't deny that more people hear music than 50 years ago, but do they really listen to it?\n The financial opportunities of musicians different than the today's crappy pop stars that the CDs offer aren't so great, and the bi money always go to the record companies.  Furtheremore, we should consider that the main ability the CDs give is to be able to listen to the same thing many times. That limits the joy of hearing something replay adter replay plus it limits your appreciation of you \"living the moment\". Musicians like Mozart and Beethoven had a reason to write the \"best\" part of the piece not to be played too many Times. When a kid with an ambition or a dream to become a musician sees only the big \"rockstars\" (whether it is classical music or not) touring and recording CDs witch famous magazines reviews he instantly creates the idea that music is only for those \"rockstars\", those who could play a Rachmaninov prelude at the age of 5 or those kids who sing at tha talent shows on tv. Furtheremore, the artist who are as good, or a little less good than the big \"rockstars\" and truly need to be heard never get a single review. I don't think democracy is an instinct right to people. There have been countless not-democratic societies throughout he history. I find democracy the exact opposite of human instincts actually. Babies and (most of) uneducated people for example who are uneducated/unsivilized thus  base their existence on their instincts seem to act more less democratic.\nDear timetravellersmith, I don't want music less accessible, I want true music in its purest form and the true meaning of it be understood by everyone. \nPeople in the past managed to exchange musical ideas, even in Bach\"s time ( Italian concerto for example), today it's even easier, even without CDs. If you let your imagination free, just reading a music sheet of a pink Floyd song, or playing it yourself might be even better than listening it live. I thing pink Floyd themselves woul prefer you to truly understand their music ( which can only be achieved by studying the score) rather than just being entertained in a concert.\nThere's huge difference both physically and psychologically between live and recorded music. In recorded music very inportant frequencies are lost and you almost never feel the chill of playing or listening live. \nI think a sound engineer can explain it better than me. \nAs I said, top performers ( wether they are good or not) do make money, but those who truly need to be heard never are heard. \nSnafu coaxer,  sound the main element of music, but not the only one, there more more introverted ways of feeling the music as well. Saying art for the sake of people and making an analogy with a car makes art a tool, like medieval times. Beethoven gave his life to undo that. Oh, and by the way, Beethoven was almost completely deaf when he wrote his greatest masterpieces, many musicologist thing being deaf was actually a blessing rather than curse for Beethoven.  \nPeople who don't like cars shouldn't drive cars.\nPsychologist find not being interested in music( brain not responding to the soundwaves) something like a desease."}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2rjau6", "body": "[Wikipedia on the (idea of) the Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity)\n\n[Wikipedia on (the idea of) whole brain emulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_brain_emulation) \n\nStrong general artificial intelligence would be the most potentially valuable invention since paper or the wheel or a process for making fire. It will happen because (1) we know that strong general intelligence exists and (2) the inventor stands to make untold quantities of money, maybe even all the money. \n\nAlternative approaches to the Singularity that appeal to me include \n\n(i) de novo artificial intelligence. This would be if someone created a strong AI by coding it. This is, I think, what most people think of the idea of smart AI and that is why they are skeptical when they look at people make a big deal about Watson playing Jeopardy. I don't think humans are smart enough to make an intelligence comparable to ourselves in any reasonable amount of time by a coding method. \n\n(ii) emergent AI. The idea that google or the internet or maybe the infrastructure will wake up one day. This sounds like homeopathic-level nonsense to me. \n\n(iii) human biological enhancement. If someone sneezes in the vicinity of a fortune 12 CEO he might get sick and that's that. We can't cure a simple flu. We are nowhere near an understanding of biology and biological engineering that ought to impress us. \n\n(iv) brain computer interfaces. This would be a strong contender but in my estimation the discovery and disclosure of an attempt at radical intelligence enhancement by any group might prompt a war. Certainly any government with jurisdiction would be highly interested in such an undertaking. \n\n(v) a new understanding of physics comparable to free infinite clean energy. Any day now, I am sure. \n\n**EDIT:** I am not saying that this project is something Google or DARPA could fund today nor am I saying that it will be done within a few weeks of someone sitting down to look at the results of whatever scanning apparatus finishes the job of modeling some brains.

They have the same kind of personal rights as every other citizen.\nSo we basically give them *more* authority and rights (I can't just demand other citizens to show me their ID) but *equal* accountability and personal rights.\n\nIt's true that police violence is very rare here in Germany, but given our history I think it's absolutely **crucial** that we as the people have the opportunity to hold every authority accountable and challenge it (if necessary) so that something like the Third Reich cannot happen again.\n\nThough, most people I talk to don't see the reason why public officials should have less personal rights (e.g. be filmed without permission while on duty) than regular citizens, given the very rare cases of police-violence and power abuse and because \"they're people like you and I\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n--\ntl;dr: **CMV**: Public officials should **not** have an equal right to privacy and be able to decide whether or not they want to be filmed/recorded. They were elected by the people and we should be able to hold them accountable for their actions while on duty. Been given more rights means also given more responsibility and giving up a certain amount of privacy in order to serve the people as intended by the law they are enforcing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nThanks for any controversy! :)  \n\n\n\n**EDIT 1: LEGAL SITUATION**  \nI was doing some further research on the legal situation and it seems to be a bit more complicated then I originally thought:\n\n- You ARE allowed to film policemen.\n- You are NOT allowed to publish videos/photos of policemen without their consent.\n- Police CAN seize something to avert a contemporary danger.\n- DEFINITION: A danger is contemporary if the impact of the harmful event has already begun or if the impact  is coming up immediately or in the next future with a probability to happen near to certainty.\n- The policemen has to decide whether or not there is an according situation of danger.\n\nThat means: If a policemen sees the danger of you breaking the law (\u00a7 33 KunstUrhG = copyright and privacy law) - e.g. by you publishing videomaterial against their will - he/she can seize your camera to avert the danger of you breaking the law.\n\nIn one precedence (Beschluss v. 30.10.2000 - 5 A 291/00 - Verlags-Archiv Nr. 779) a judge decided that \"the sheer recording of a police operation does not found a contemporary danger of violating \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 33 KunstUrhG [right in one's own image]. If there is specific indication of illegal publishing, seizing the photo-, videomaterial may be justified.\"\n\n(Original: \"Das Filmen oder Fotografieren eines polizeilichen Einsatzes begr\u00fcndet allein noch nicht die gegenw\u00e4rtige Gefahr, die Aufnahmen w\u00fcrden unter Versto\u00df gegen \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 33 KunstUrhG (Recht am eigenen Bild) verbreitet. Deuten konkrete Anhaltspunkte auf eine rechtswidrige Verbreitung der Aufnahmen hin, kann die Sicherstellung von Foto- und Filmmaterial gerechtfertigt sein.\")\n\nIt does not define what qualifies as specific indication of you publishing the material. A slightly annoyed demeanor *might* be enough. (my interpretation)\n\nIt's also important to know that the German definition of \"publication\" supposedly *includes* publication in private (e.g. family members). (I couldn't find the original law, though. It might be in \u00a7 17 Verbreitungsrecht or in a definition of the word \"\u00d6ffentlichkeit\" [public])\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
