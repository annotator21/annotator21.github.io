The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime."}, {"id": "cnhna3t", "body": "&gt;Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night?

Pickpocketing is discrete. And is something to be wary of when you are in a crowd, since it's easy to do when there's lots of people around. In this case, be sure to move your things to your front pockets (where it's hard to access by a 3rd party), and be sure to zip up your bags, preferably locking them. And hold them close.\n\nThis is true of any populated area. Just like you don't leave your shit lying around. Amusingly, I lived in 'the safest city in the US' (determined by crime rate) people left their shit all around. I come from an area high in crime. If you left your shit like that it'd get stolen. So people knew not to do it. In this safe location, people did it anyway. if they got their shit stolen, it's their fault for leaving it there, not taking proper precaution.\n\nI've never had something stolen, besides the one point when I was growing up (no power over where I lived) and my house got broken into. It was the sketchy neighbors who scraped the vin numbers off cars and sold them. Obviously they were no good. All my life I told my parents how shitty of a place we live is, they didn't care, bunkered down with an expensive house anyway. And voila, we got broken into. In response, we got a security system (which stays mostly off, but the sign is in the yard), and new neighbors. No more incidents or problems.

But that's why a discussion is necessary, rather than to drown it out with \"VICTIM BLAMING LA LA LA CANT HEAR YOU!\" While technically suicide would prevent further crimes being done to you, it's not an optimal solution. Just like being in your house 24/7 would work, but is also not optimal. At some point there's a bit of risk, and each person has a tolerance for that risk.\n\n&gt;As my original post says, it completely depends on how the topic is approached. Yes, you can share information to an uneducated person to prevent bad situations from occurring.\n\nThis is the point being addressed. Whenever you attempt to share advice to the victim, it gets construed as victim blaming. Which isn't the intent most of the time.\n\n&gt;Well, you made it a part of the argument. The topic is victim blaming, and that includes arguing about the definition of victim blaming because not everyone agrees to the extent of it.\n\nFor this arguement/discussion, yes. But I meant more of in the terms of what we should do to fix an individual problem. We shouldn't say \"it's this random criminal's fault!\" just like we shouldn't say \"it's this random victim's fault!\" we should say: here's x/y/z of what happened and what lead up to it. Some actions were done by both parties. Here's a way to fix it to prevent future things from happening.\n\nBy pointing fault and blame, it's being counterproductive. Both are at fault, technically.\n\n&gt;I don't agree this definition you use is relevant at all, and its not the normal definition that the average person uses, so you just make this all confusing. The mere existence of a person in a place does not place them \"at fault\" for anything. All you are saying is \"things happen because things\".\n\nThis is true though. How do you define fault in a useful way? IMO you can't. The most accurate would be to describe the causes that lead up to it. The least accurate and useful would be to say it's the criminal, which we already have a word for. What use do you have by using the word when discussing an event? Note that the people who call out 'victim blaming' are the ones using fault. Not the people giving advice.\n\n&gt;So maybe we should use the word \"culpable\" instead of \"fault\" here to clarify exactly what we mean. Culpable simply means \"to blame\".\n\nWhy do we need to blame anything? Why not simply state the causes and actions that lead up the the event and how to avoid them? Blaming things is useless.\n\n&gt;Is the victim culpable for being mugged? No. To suggest otherwise would be victim blaming. Yes: Regardless of personal responsibility, because that's a completely separate issue.\n\nI would say they are, in part, responsible for the event to occur. If they weren't present, the event wouldn't occur. Whether their intention was to cause it or not doesn't matter (it does when apprehending criminals though). It's like if you pulled the table cloth and a glass fell. You caused the glass to fall. You may not have intended it, but that's what happened when you did your actions. Don't pull the table cloth, and the glass won't fall (whoops, victim blaming, I forgot).\n\n&gt;And that's my entire point in my original response. Victim blaming and the discussions had afterward are in no way related to each other when the discussion is had correctly UNLESS you can prove culpability, like your example of a person getting punched when provoking a drunk guy. You can prove the guy was provoked, because there would be witnesses.\n\nBut what if provoking him was unintended? Simply someone speaking their mind, unintentionally provoking the other person, who then initiated the conflict? This can be stretched further to thieves. Is flashing around expensive gadgets provoking a thief? Either way, both are causes in the same way: helping build motive for a crime/problem.\n\nThe point isn't to point fault at the victim. It's to help the victim realize what they can do to prevent future similar problems. Whether it be the direct cause or not. Driving accidents are solely caused by driving, regardless who's at fault. So if you don't drive, you won't get into one. Simple. It's \"victim blaming\" according to you, but also valuable advice.\n\n&gt;That is where the line gets blurry, on \"unless you can prove culpability\". Is the victim culpable for their house being robbed because they didn't lock their door? Well, we don't frankly know. Would the robbery have happened if the door had been locked? It's completely possible. We have no proof either way.\n\nThis is why it's pointless to discuss. As for who's responsible is for the law to decide. What we are talking about here is what the victim can do to make themselves safer from future crimes. Which is somehow construed as victim blaming. We aren't saying \"the victim's actions forced the crime to take place\". We are saying \"the victim can take certain actions to reduce the chance of being a victim.\"\n\n&gt;That is the exact moment where victim blaming occurs. These assumptions. A person makes an argument on the assumption that the robbery would not have occurred if the door had been locked, despite no proof. \n\nNot quite, they make the assumption that the robbery has a less chance of happening if the door is locked. Which is statically true.\n\n&gt;We assume the woman was raped because she was wearing a short dress. \n\nFalse assumption, but sure. I'd agree it's important to note what actually contributes to the causes, rather than what we perceive it to be.\n\n&gt;We assume the guy was mugged because of the money clip. \n\nPeople get mugged for money. People flashing around money are mugged more often. Thus, flashing around money makes you have a higher chance of getting mugged. Avoid flashing around money, and you'll reduce the chance you get mugged.\n\nIt's not that simply doing the act of pulling out money makes you automatically get mugged. But that it's tempting to criminals, and definitely increases the risk of a mugging.\n\n&gt;We have no proof of any of these assumptions\n\nSure we do. We have research/statistics that show that locks decrease burglars, 'looking poor' decreases muggings, etc. I think the \"short dress\" thing is the only one unfounded. IIRC, most rapes are done by people they are familiar with, so clothing isn't as much of an issue.\n\n&gt;Can we discuss these things? Wearing a short dress, carrying a money clip, locking your door? YES. Of course we can. But not in regards to the specific victim, because we have no proof they are related.\n\nRight. But we cans suggest these things as future actions to take to reduce risk. Not saying that's what prompted the event (naturally). But it might be a contributing cause that can be reduced or removed.\n\n&gt;Involving the specific victim shifts the entire discussion away from the root of the problem, as you said!\n\nTrue. The specific victim isn't all that important to the discussion, other than to look at what *actually* was a cause. The \"victim blaming\" is mostly (from what I see) trying to give this advice *to* the victim. Not saying it caused it, but saying \"hey, don't flash money around. Not saying you did, but it's a good thing to keep in mind if you don't want to be mugged.\"\n\nNaturally if you say \"you're dumb for flashing money around.\" that's bad, not useful, etc. The implication is the above sentence, but it comes out as victim blaming and assuming that was the cause (when it might not have been).\n\nAnd I think this is the real issue. People who call out victim blaming see the latter. The people who get called victim blamers attempt to do the former and sometimes appear as the latter.\n\nBut sometimes it's a specific cause. Person walked into X street and got mugged. X street is known to have a lot of muggings. Giving them advice to stay away from X street is good advice, and probably a core reason they (in particular) got mugged. Of course the mugger is the criminal and the sole cause (he was gonna mug someone regardless), but the victim can reduce their risk by avoiding X street.\n\n&gt;I can say \"That's an unsafe neighborhood, we shouldn't carry expensive things around with us.\" That is an intelligent reasonable discussion on personal safety that does not include the victim in any regard. The two issues are separated and now the conversation is valuable.\n\nI think this is what OP is trying to get at. Perhaps it's not the exact reason things happened, but it's a probable cause, and giving that advice to the victim might help them in the future.\n\nBut I agree, simply blaming the victim isn't helpful."}, {"id": "cnhjtqq", "body": "Here's the difference.\n\nSomething happens to Mary.

The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4.

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You are fortunate enough to have a workable solution \u2013 not everyone else will be and having causation repeated to them over and over again isn\u2019t exactly helpful for them, it\u2019s demoralising and endlessly frustrating. \n\nFor a real-life example, there was a news story from Montreal a few months ago regarding a spate of sexual assaults in taxis. The police warned women to not [use taxis alone](http://www.ccla.org/rightswatch/2014/10/16/montreal-police-criticized-for-advice-to-women-in-response-to-taxi-assaults).

What do you have her do? Just not go to work for weeks on end? \n\nExplaining causation can be useful if you have the option to readjust.

I'm sure if you repeated your above quote to them, they'd be *super* appreciative. \n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to use the \u201cP\u201d word (sorry!) but your point of view comes from a position of (small p) privilege. You are fortunate enough to have a workable solution \u2013 not everyone else will be and having causation repeated to them over and over again isn\u2019t exactly helpful for them, it\u2019s demoralising and endlessly frustrating. \n\nFor a real-life example, there was a news story from Montreal a few months ago regarding a spate of sexual assaults in taxis. The police warned women to not [use taxis alone](http://www.ccla.org/rightswatch/2014/10/16/montreal-police-criticized-for-advice-to-women-in-response-to-taxi-assaults). Which is super easy for the cops to say when they aren\u2019t the ones who would be most affected by not using taxis alone. It might be fine for some people, but it kind of sucks if, say, you\u2019re a young woman who works in a bar at the other side of town and your only other option is walking home at 3am on a Saturday night. What do you have her do? Just not go to work for weeks on end? \n\nExplaining causation can be useful if you have the option to readjust. But for people who have no other realistic options: what would you have them do? \n\nTelling a turkey that is isn\u2019t a good idea to be a turkey in November doesn\u2019t help the turkey very much. \n"}, {"id": "cnhm03m", "body": "That's a good point. You shouldn't apologize for bringing up privilege, as it's absolutely applicable. I don't live in these high-crime or dangerous areas, so it's easier for me to avoid them. If it means not walking by myself late at night, that doesn't impact my livelihood. So that's very relevant.\n\nI am reconsidering the latter of my two points, which is that it's a worthwhile endeavor. Specifically: it's not always worthwhile to explain causation to someone, because many times they know already and cannot change the situation (maybe they work or live in an unsafe area, etc.). Do you think it's a worthwhile discussion to have in general, though? Like when people say things like \"we need to have a societal conversational about X\"? I just feel like the victim blaming issue is such a sensitive topic, it makes it difficult to have intelligent conversations about it without causing offense.\n"}, {"id": "2rnfn0", "body": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part.

Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability.

I'll say \"XYZ can lead to bad things, but do it if you'd like.\" With the slutty clothing example, you can surely wear it. I got not problems with it. But if it leads to rape, then that's what it leads to. Note that this isn't actually the case (statistics show otherwise). But if skydiving can cause death, and you die, then there's not really much to blame. You knew the risks, or failed to know them. And then you accepted those risks.\n\nIn business, maximizing risks is done as an aggressive strategy that can earn a lot of money, but can sink a business. Minimizing risks is the opposite, less money, but more safe. Which you want is an opinion. But if the max risk people fail, they should've seen it coming and know the risks.\n\n&gt;I've always thought their view was inconsistent, because you could argue them down to \"But you wouldn't just stop driving a car, would you?\" (or similar).\n\nYea, I'm not fond of cars. I don't trust my own driving ability (I get anxiety whenever I'm in the drivers seat), and I pick and choose the people who drive when I ride with them. I typically try to avoid them when possible, opting to walk, and I personally love subways.\n\nBut I *do* know and accept the risks whenever I enter a motorized vehicle. Which is why I put on my seatbelt and do other safety recommended things when I do.\n\nCertainly some of my actions can *seem* inconsistent. But simply because there isn't another option. And I won't be thrilled about it. Alternatively, it might just be that my risk tolerance is a bit higher than what you are used to me having. Some days you feel risky, you know?\n\n&gt;Therefore I found you remarkably consistent in your view when you said that no, you wouldn't. It's of course still a consistent view, but I respect that you think about the social benefit (or lack thereof) before you decide to speak about something.\n\nI try not to advocate something that I myself wouldn't support and follow through with. I'm not saying be vegetarian, because I see plants and animals as equal. I eat both. I wouldn't be opposed to eating a human either (wouldn't want to for other reasons though). But yes, I try to keep my views consistent. To me, having it consistent speaks leagues about your opinion on them. If you are religious, but don't follow the practices, you obviously don't care as much as the guy who does.\n\nI also try not to say things I don't actually think (unless I'm playing devil's advocate).

Clearly it's not the case for everybody.\n\nFor me it's different. It's not necessarily *low*. But it can be depending not he situation. Walking to class? That's low risk, no problem. Travel? High risk, depending on location. But I love the idea. So I be careful about it. Plan where I'm going, what I'm doing. Be sure to know where to walk, where to get the required things, and so on. Once that's out of the way, I return to my regular assessment and have fun in the new location.\n\nGoing to LA? Be sure to know the way there and back, and be sure to know which routes to walk along to be as safe as possible. Little Tokyo surprised me, seeing as it's a lot less aggressive/la-style than the rest of the place. Which I then figured into future assessments.\n\nAs for bars. I don't like the idea of them in general. I don't like drunk people, I don't like the possibility of problems there (due to drunk people), it's too loud, problems on transportation there and back (how do you drive to and from a bar?), and so on. Going to the pub on campus is fine, seeing as it's still \"school level\" stuff. I don't drink either, to ensure my decisions don't get all messed up. I'm not fond of mind altering anything. So I haven't touched the stuff.\n\nBut yes, I try to stick to what I *actually* like/support/believe/etc. Not just what I think *should* be the case.  Sometimes that causes problems (like lack of being able to get places), but that comes with the views.\n\n&gt;Clearly it's not the case for everybody.\n\nSure, and most people probably have a higher risk tolerance than I do. And *some* people have it *waaaaayyyy* higher. Like people who think it's reasonable to drink a bunch and then drive somewhere. Or not pay attention while they drive. Ooooorrrr head to a sketchy part of town flashing around iPhones and MacBooks.\n\nMy general thoughts are that people can live how they like, but they should be aware of the consequences of living as such. Sure, spend all your cash, don't focus on saving, and raise up a credit card bill. No problem. Just don't complain when you lack money.\n\nBut yes, on the car thing, I don't have a license or own a car. Which sucks sometimes. If I need to go somewhere far, I get a person who I know drives well to drive. Otherwise I use a different mode of transportation (walk, subway, etc).\n\nI think once self-driving cars come out, I'll be more inclined and happy to use a car.

We ought to work towards a world in which this is the case. However, our world is not currently like this, unfortunately. As u/gomboloid says above, a productive discussion can result from saying something like: \"I got mugged at this part of town, maybe you should avoid going there at this time of night\". Of course the mugger causes the mugging; but if changing your behavior in a certain way reduces the chance of getting mugged, why not do it? \n\nYou dismiss it as a \"minor contribution\" to the cause. But if there are certain precautions one might take in order to protect themselves, why not take them?\n\nYes, the \"full blame\" lies with the perpetrator. Like I said, this isn't a question of justification. This is a touchy issue, and people are often unable to think about these things in a rational way because they're afraid of implying some sort of justification. My first view is \"explaining causation does not imply justification\". Throughout your response, you continually use \"blame\" language: \"at fault\", \"full blame\", etc., when I never placed any blame on the victim. \n\n\"You can play the game of circumstances until you can't do anything without being at fault.\"\nLet's be realistic here.

Although people are generally in control of their behavior and the choice to attack is in the hands of the assailant, something in their brain is telling them this is the right move and something the victim did put them in the equation\n\n\nSometimes you're right, the event was absolutely caused by the selfishness of an assailant who enjoys other peoples pain or having power over someone else to hurt them, or who cares more about getting what they want than the effect it has on the other person, but that's a very small percentage of crimes. And the victims aren't random. The reason someone becomes a victim could be based on their choices or circumstances out of their control (like who else was around, or they were wearing a color the attacker hates) but its important to look at what put them in the position to be hurt in the first place as well as what put the other person in the position of attacker. That's basic survival, learning to avoid danger through mistakes, both your own mistakes and other peoples mistakes. Understanding the mistakes of the victim is about preventing becoming a victim yourself, understanding the assailants motives is about preventing others from becoming victims as well. And if we dont try to understand then society is drastically less likely to prevent it from happening again to anyone anywhere and an individual is less likely to avoid danger themselves. \n\nThere is no one single reason anything happens, even if it looks like someone hurt someone else to get something they wanted and didn't need to survive, like in a rape.

Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The guy mugging you did it because that's how he gets money.

No alcohol, far from revelling clothing, but still a common crime.   They either choose the woman they decide is the most provacative or the easiest access, but they choose out of the same pool.   You might think the girl in the little black dress is more likely to be chosen, but if everyone wears sensible jeans and a t shirt, it might be the blonde or the redhead.

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

What would've been irrational was forming the relationship and then *not* building it up. Some people can see the potential in others, which can be beneficial. Along with that, some things which might seem disadvantageous might be a personal preference of the other person. Like shyness.\n\n&gt;she didn't do this because she expected me to help her in return; she did it because she felt hurt to see me suffering.\n\nIf this is true, a common occurrence must be to see your wife drop what she's doing and help out every stranger that she sees suffering. I'm guessing there's other reasons as well, even if this might have been the major factor. Otherwise why not just pick up a bum and help him out? Or three bums?\n\n&gt;she benefitted from this in an extreme way - as we are now married, and now that i'm strong enough to stand on my own, i am able to help her out. but if that were here goal, she wouldn't have taken the risk.\n\nSubconsciously it was the goal. Humans are hardwired to work together. As it's mutually beneficial. Naturally we can override that, but most people follow that wiring.\n\nIf not, perhaps your wife could give me a hand. Haha. Chances are that won't happen, because it's not simply the 'need' that was the attraction.\n\n&gt;i will keep working to help my family members because i love them, even if they don't pay me back.\n\nThere's a few underlying reasons why this might be. Though if you help them, and they keep taking advantage and backstabbing, it's illogical. But as a whole, keeping a lineage is biologically important. It's the same reason most people have the mindset of having kids, regardless of how illogical it might be. Society's overpopulated, kids are expensive and time consuming, etc. The logically better answer would be to not have them. But it depends on what you are going for.\n\n&gt;people who rationally analyze every move and only take choices that benefit them in expected value are not as resilient as people who love each other, because people who love each other will put in more effort to defend their loved ones and get them out of messes.\n\nThis takes the assumption that benefit-driven people don't make mutual social bonds. Which is exactly my definition of 'love'. Unless you can somehow define it without that trait. A strong, long lasting bond of mutual trust is called a \"friend\". A stronger bond, perhaps shorter, but most likely longer, would be 'love' (along with some other opinions/traits you find favorable in a suitable mate).\n\n&gt;the strict rationalists who derive no joy from connection, and only value future gains, will not attract anyone to help them when they need it most.\n\nI fail to see why not. On the outside, a benefit-driven individual would *appear* like any other. Just with different ideologies and motivations. The other non-benefit driven individuals would then see them as equals. And a bond is formed.\n\nAlso note, loans are one such type of impersonal social bond. A person or organization gives you cash, and you are expected to pay it back. Otherwise there are negative repercussions.\n\n&gt;but when you are in a lot of trouble and the odds of you getting out are slim, those who love you are far more likely to take the risk of helping you.\n\nA \"strict rationalist\" (your words) would certainly have individuals who consider themselves 'loved', and would 'love' the rationalist back.  That doesn't change the objective fact of the bond.\n\nIt seems you have the mutually beneficial social bonds I'm talking about, but simply muddy it up with ambiguous language. And perhaps not realize that it's beneficial.\n\nYou also see benefit-driven individuals as \"worse\" or \"lesser\", which is amusing, because most people are benefit-driven.

Again, if I make a mistake, I'd love for someone to point it out. Especially if I didn't know what the mistake was. Though, given my general behavior and activities, I know fairly well what the risks are and what mistakes I made.

That's like saying you shouldn't post on gaming threads helping people out. Because they won't accept your advice anyway. Yes, some people will ignore it. But it's best to get as much advice and information as possible.\n\nProviding it is my way of helping the community. Even if the victim doesn't take it, someone else might see it and use it.\n\n&gt;it's very common for a person not to be objective about things the are suffering from. if you're capable of this, that's incredibly rare.\n\nYup. And it bothers me every day. I actually had a superiority complex when I was younger, considering everyone else \"stupid\". I now realize they act on emotion, and not caring to minimize risk. Which I consider stupid, but that's their choice. I still consider them responsible for their actions.\n\nHonestly, objective self-analysis and improvement is the \\#1 thing that should be taught in school. Not history and crap like that.\n\n&gt;you can say this easily, and you may be right. \n\nYup. It's why I'm not afraid to speak my mind and take advice. If I see someone with money, I'm gonna ask them how they got it. What worked for them might work for me too. Same goes for safety and other information.\n\n&gt;if you're a sociopath it's much easier for you to think without being influenced by your emotions.\n\nTIL I'm a sociopath :P. I've actually considered that for a while. But I've found it difficult to self-diagnose, as I don't have a comparison point. 'Regular' people seem to think completely differently than I do, which leads me to think something is off about me. But I can't quite determine what it is. Either way, my opinion still stands.\n\n&gt;for some people, it takes years of effort to think clearly about their pain. if you have too much pain, this just isn't possible.\n\nDepends on what kind it is. Physical pain, I've been in a lot and was fairly fine. I mean, I haven't lost an arm or anything, but I'd imagine I'd get by okay. As far as mental pain, that's much easier. As I've dealt with psychological 'problems' (inconsistency from other people) pretty much my entire life, and I can get over things of that nature fairly easily.\n\nI've also used CBT to remove some phobias and anxiety problems I've had. Why 'normal' people can't seem to do this is beyond me. Do they not care about improving themselves?\n\n&gt;there are lots of people who suffer from this. and yes, it's easy for you to say 'well, too bad, that's your fault' \n\nIt is, really. It's like walking into a grocery store and complaining there's no video games. Duh. You chose to walk into a grocery store instead of a video game store. It's not the grocery store's responsibility to sell games.\n\n&gt;but that isn't really helpful for anyone.\n\nNaturally. Which is why I don't simply say that to people. I typically tell them \"you dun goofed, here's why: X, Y, Z\". Their reception of that information is up to them. I see it as a humane service to provide useful information to those that request it or are in need of it.\n\nIf you have money problems, I'm gonna give you tips. My parents don't talk money to me at all, but I know they are having problems. So I ask what's up, get info, and help them out. In the end I ended up saving them money because they followed my advice. If not, they would've gone with the other choice and spent more money.\n\nI'd naturally give this same advice to anyone else I saw in need. My parents aren't special in that regard.\n\n&gt; i guess if it makes you feel better, go for it. but if you really want to help people, you gotta meet them where they are.\n\nI give useful information. As I said, I try to avoid the 'blame game'. It's futile and pointless. The victim's at as much fault as the perpetrator, but for different reasons. Both can do actions to avoid similar problems in the future.\n\n&gt;if you don't want to help people \n\nI do, which is why I help them think better, more critically, and in terms of self-improvement. Rather than emotionally, playing blame games, and saying 'it's okay, you did nothing wrong!'. Giving them emotional padding simply ignores the problem, rather than fixing it. Which in the long run doesn't help at all besides making someone feel better. Which, IMO, is something they can handle on their own.\n\n\"Hope you feel better\", \"I'm praying for you\", and \"Stay strong!\" aren't helpful. In fact, they are cookie cutter waste of space and time pleasantries that don't mean shit. Just shut up if you aren't going to help. give me stuff I can use.\n\nIf someone's going to feel bad, there's nothing you can say or do that will change their mind. If anything, you can simply make them forget that they felt bad. That doesn't fix the problem at all, it just hides it.\n\n&gt;you're moving into a world where anything a person can do, a robot could do better. \n\nI already think this most of the time and actually opt for the robot solution when possible. Self-checkout, online purchases, etc. The only thing robots can't do right now is creative work. Which is the primary reason I talk to people. To get opinions and creative ideas.\n\n&gt;the only exception wil be 'providing caring human interaction'.\n\nThat too. Though I think we have different definitions. I don't find meaningless pleasantries to be \"caring human interaction\". I see it as a vested interest in a similar or uniquely thinking person which is mutually returned. Or something to that extent.\n\nThat said, I mostly see people as organic robots anyway.\n\n&gt;you might want to rethink that stance.\n\nWhy so? I've found that this 'stance' is the most beneficial to me, and people that I associate with."}, {"id": "cnhud0b", "body": "&gt;you have this backwards here; my advice is not to tell someone you don't know who's hurting that they've made a mistake.\n\nWhy not? Again, if I make a mistake, I'd love for someone to point it out. Especially if I didn't know what the mistake was. Though, given my general behavior and activities, I know fairly well what the risks are and what mistakes I made. Which is why 'bad things' rarely happen to me.\n\nWhen someone offers advice, I evaluate it, and if it's good, I use it. Like a regular person should.\n\n&gt;of course those people should listen, but the fact that many won't is why it's not worth telling them unless you personally know them.\n\nAnd why is that my problem? That's like saying you shouldn't post on gaming threads helping people out. Because they won't accept your advice anyway. Yes, some people will ignore it. But it's best to get as much advice and information as possible.\n\nProviding it is my way of helping the community. Even if the victim doesn't take it, someone else might see it and use it.\n\n&gt;it's very common for a person not to be objective about things the are suffering from. if you're capable of this, that's incredibly rare.\n\nYup. And it bothers me every day. I actually had a superiority complex when I was younger, considering everyone else \"stupid\". I now realize they act on emotion, and not caring to minimize risk. Which I consider stupid, but that's their choice. I still consider them responsible for their actions.\n\nHonestly, objective self-analysis and improvement is the \\#1 thing that should be taught in school. Not history and crap like that.\n\n&gt;you can say this easily, and you may be right. \n\nYup. It's why I'm not afraid to speak my mind and take advice. If I see someone with money, I'm gonna ask them how they got it. What worked for them might work for me too. Same goes for safety and other information.\n\n&gt;if you're a sociopath it's much easier for you to think without being influenced by your emotions.\n\nTIL I'm a sociopath :P. I've actually considered that for a while. But I've found it difficult to self-diagnose, as I don't have a comparison point. 'Regular' people seem to think completely differently than I do, which leads me to think something is off about me. But I can't quite determine what it is. Either way, my opinion still stands.\n\n&gt;for some people, it takes years of effort to think clearly about their pain. if you have too much pain, this just isn't possible.\n\nDepends on what kind it is. Physical pain, I've been in a lot and was fairly fine. I mean, I haven't lost an arm or anything, but I'd imagine I'd get by okay. As far as mental pain, that's much easier. As I've dealt with psychological 'problems' (inconsistency from other people) pretty much my entire life, and I can get over things of that nature fairly easily.\n\nI've also used CBT to remove some phobias and anxiety problems I've had. Why 'normal' people can't seem to do this is beyond me. Do they not care about improving themselves?\n\n&gt;there are lots of people who suffer from this. and yes, it's easy for you to say 'well, too bad, that's your fault' \n\nIt is, really. It's like walking into a grocery store and complaining there's no video games. Duh. You chose to walk into a grocery store instead of a video game store. It's not the grocery store's responsibility to sell games.\n\n&gt;but that isn't really helpful for anyone.\n\nNaturally. Which is why I don't simply say that to people. I typically tell them \"you dun goofed, here's why: X, Y, Z\". Their reception of that information is up to them. I see it as a humane service to provide useful information to those that request it or are in need of it.\n\nIf you have money problems, I'm gonna give you tips. My parents don't talk money to me at all, but I know they are having problems. So I ask what's up, get info, and help them out. In the end I ended up saving them money because they followed my advice. If not, they would've gone with the other choice and spent more money.\n\nI'd naturally give this same advice to anyone else I saw in need. My parents aren't special in that regard.\n\n&gt; i guess if it makes you feel better, go for it. but if you really want to help people, you gotta meet them where they are.\n\nI give useful information. As I said, I try to avoid the 'blame game'. It's futile and pointless. The victim's at as much fault as the perpetrator, but for different reasons. Both can do actions to avoid similar problems in the future.\n\n&gt;if you don't want to help people \n\nI do, which is why I help them think better, more critically, and in terms of self-improvement. Rather than emotionally, playing blame games, and saying 'it's okay, you did nothing wrong!'. Giving them emotional padding simply ignores the problem, rather than fixing it. Which in the long run doesn't help at all besides making someone feel better. Which, IMO, is something they can handle on their own.\n\n\"Hope you feel better\", \"I'm praying for you\", and \"Stay strong!\" aren't helpful. In fact, they are cookie cutter waste of space and time pleasantries that don't mean shit. Just shut up if you aren't going to help. give me stuff I can use.\n\nIf someone's going to feel bad, there's nothing you can say or do that will change their mind. If anything, you can simply make them forget that they felt bad. That doesn't fix the problem at all, it just hides it.\n\n&gt;you're moving into a world where anything a person can do, a robot could do better. \n\nI already think this most of the time and actually opt for the robot solution when possible.

Given my current experience as the only data point, I must say that they indeed choose to. Perhaps they lack control. Either that, or they function entirely different than me. I actually tackled with solipsism for a while because of this.\n\n&gt;i knew i was acting on emotion, but i wasn't sure what logical system made sense to work with.\n\nI think this is probably the biggest problem. People don't care to improve themselves, and don't know where to begin with objective and critical thinking. Which is why I think classes for it should be required.\n\n&gt;i wanted to be kind and good to people, and i felt shitty when i did anything for myself.\n\nThe two aren't mutually exclusive. Also consider *why* you want to be good to people. I hold the opinion true altruism doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;fixing that required working my way through lots of complicated emotions. if i could have just done it 'instantly' i would have - but that choice wasn't available.\n\nWhich is why it should be taught early, so people don't struggle, and so more people can learn.\n\n&gt;people who understood i was operating on flawed principles were able to help me. people who judged me for operating on flawed principles made me more upset and just made the problem worse.\n\nDefinitely. When I was younger I went through a process of refining my understanding of things. Only more recently did I adjust my core values.\n\n&gt;you may very well be a sociopath. i don't mean this as an insult or slander;\n\nI don't take it as such. If you said it in spite, perhaps. But your tone is neutral and conversational, so I don't think of it as such. Either way, I don't have ill feelings towards the disabled or mentally different.\n\n&gt;if you suspect you are different from most people, i'd suggest that the advice you offer is great for people who are like you, but can hurt people who aren't like you. \n\nTrue, which is why I avoid giving suggestions I would give to myself or someone like me. Either way I try to provide objective information, regardless of how you perceive it. I'll recommend \"bad\" movies, simply because I know the person will like it (even if I don't). Similar idea.\n\n&gt;you haven't really experienced psychological pain, then.\n\nI'd disagree and said that I have. Perhaps it's different than others, but it's definitely there. I remember when I had a breakdown over getting a \"B\" in a class. As I said, I deal with mental problems almost daily, so I'm more than equipped to handle my brain.\n\n&gt;i did care tremendously about improving myself. doing this required years of effort, most of which were oriented around understanding my emotions and how they worked\n\nTook me about a year. Some point during 4th grade until about middle school or so. 4th-5th for covering and having it not effect my actions (with a few slips). Middle school was a lot of grudges and unshown hate. By high school I had that shit down, and didn't worry at all about emotions effecting my actions. During that time I had a lot of fundamental worldview shifts as well.\n\n&gt;reading the way you write, it seems more likely to me that you are a sociopath, but a genuinely altruistic one. \n\nI consider myself to be the opposite of altruistic. I also don't think true altruism exists. I think people function similarly to myself (a natural assumption and an unprovable one), and my worldview has come to accept singular non-timedependent reincarnation. that we are all the same. So I try to help out my fellow humans when possible, expecting they'll return the favor. It also makes things nicer in the long run.\n\nAs for the way I write, I try to stay in a neutral and objective tone. Though  I can get fired up about things I'm passionate about, or when someone is systematically ignoring and trying to uproot a core view when they don't have any particular reason to do so. Like religion.\n\n&gt; this picture here makes me cry when i think about it too much\n\nBesides reflective emotions (which are a cognitive thing I'm aware of), I get nothing from this picture.\n\n&gt;my guess is that it won't bother you on the same level that it bothers me. my emotoins are crazy strong for some reason; \n\nCorrect. Though I find that certain anime bring me to this level. But only specific parts that probably would be 'funny' or not at all important to someone else. It's amusing.\n\n&gt;when i think about someone else's state of mind, it's extremely difficult not to experience that state of mind as well. \n\nAs I said, mirrored/reflective emotions. Mine are mostly muted, but given a similar situation to what I've experienced and mine can flare up.\n\n&gt;it may be that you don't have a lot of empathy. this means you are ideally suited for some tasks, like being a surgeon \n\nNope. I hate high risk situations, and realistic gore makes me queasy. I didn't even like acknowledging that I had a huge gaping gash on my elbow (you could see to the bone) after a electric scooter accident.\n\nAs for the empathy thing, I dunno. Empathy/Sympathy are really meaningless words to me, and I always forget which is which.\n\n&gt;but it's also what lets us build stable, healthy relationships and lets people feel confident going 'above and beyond' to help strangers.\n\nSo in other words you help strangers for absolutely no reason, other than some illogical reason that you aren't sure why you are having? Seems absurd. I help people, but for a very logical reason that makes sense and can be explained to anyone.\n\n&gt;but what would you say to someone who lost their husband because the police got the wrong address, broke into their house, and shot the man with a baseball bat who grabbed it trying to defend his family? will that really help the person in their situation?\n\nYup, not much you could've done to minimize that situation. Similarly when video game streamers get SWATted. It's out of their control. At this point, there's no advice to be given.\n\n&gt;critical thinking is a very resource intensive process, and is extremely hard to do when you are upset.\n\nPeople's lack of critical thinking is what makes me upset. To calm myself down, I must return to my acceptance that people are 'dumb' and don't do the logically obvious thing.\n\nMy cat dying, for instance, would bum me out (I like my cat), but I wouldn't be an emotional train wreck because of it.\n\n&gt;\"stay strong! i'm glad you're ok. here's a list of routes i've found\" is WAY more helpful to most people than \"here is a list of safer places to walk\". you may be an exception yourself.\n\nEither to me is acceptable. I mostly filter out pleasantries anyway. As far as what I'd post, typically a short simple pleasantry (hope you are okay) along with some advice. No advice? No pleasantry.\n\nI also recently found out people don't read through an entire body of text before reacting. I figured it didn't matter and wrote negatives-&gt;positives. They got upset, and I tried to point out the positive part of my comment. No dice. Criticism comes from both what you did wrong *and* what you did right.\n\n&gt;i was suggesting you reconsider was lack of a desire to help people.\n\nI don't though. Yes, I have a lack of desire to help a random stranger when I'm busy. But if I'm just mindlessly heading somewhere (maybe for lunch), I'd help out someone if possible. I see it as contributing to a society where people can act in mutually beneficial ways.\n\n&gt;you just don't seem to value emotional support as a form of help.\n\nCorrect. I don't understand why emotions have a large impact on decision making either. As far as \"emotional support' saying \"I'm praying for you\" means nothing. Seeing as I could've said that to myself. Or simply assumed that they have that feeling in mind. Repetitive comments of the same manner are even more useless. If you gotta say it, just have one person do it. Not 20.\n\n&gt; it seems you may not need it in order to think clearly - but i think most people do.\n\nI'll keep that in mind."}, {"id": "2rnfn0", "body": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place.

Let us imagine your night time mugging from the perspective of the criminal.  They need money.  They elect to get this money through robbery.  If they stake out a specific alley and a victim appears they get money, if no victim appears they leave the alley and find a victim somewhere else.  They need money and they intend to use crime to obtain it, so whether or not you personally are mugged someone is going to be mugged.\n\nHave you ever heard the one about being eaten by a bear?  \"I don't need to be able to outrun the bear - I just need to be able to out run you!\"  Same logic.  You can avoid being robbed but someone is getting robbed whether or not you avoid that specific alley.\n\nStranger rape is a similar issue.  Putting yourself in the mind of the predator when you buy roofies you are planning on raping someone.  If all the girls at the bar are dressed like nuns except one your choice of targets might be influenced but when you bought that pill someone was going to get raped as a result.\n\nMost rape however is not stranger rape (most crime for that matter is not stranger crime), it is someone we are related to either by friendship, blood, or marriage.  In this instance things become almost impossible to pin down from a \"causation\" perspective and, more troubling, any attempt to view these things from a causation perspective leads victims to a horrible amount of internal guilt as, in any relationship with prolonged periods of contact and trust, they have acted in a way that might be interpreted as flirtatious or seductive.\n\nOn your second view: I would argue that since the majority of this type of violence defies causation as it is done by people known/related to the victim if we were to engage in examinations of causation we would be left with a huge group of victims harboring guilt (as is actually the case) and learning very little of any actual utility (i.e. we might be able to identify certain areas in which gangs are active and target them with extra policing - however we already do this without inquiring into how short the rape victim's skirt was)."}, {"id": "2rnfn0", "body": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while.

"}, {"id": "2rnfn0", "body": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification.

I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part.

I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take.

There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got.

I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred.

Cars are supposed to stop for pedestrians."}, {"id": "2rnfn0", "body": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault).

When I was raped by my now ex boyfriend, I blamed myself. \n\nI am an extremely logical person with little by way of pride. I don't usually care to know who is at fault, just to know what factors contributed to the outcome so I can influence a better outcome in the future. This is what I believe you are describing should be harmless.\n\n\nSo after the rape, I asked myself what caused it. At the time, I was struggling with low libido because of stress. It's important to note that I have a serious medical condition related to stress that is thus far a medical mystery: I blackout when I am too physically and/or emotionally stressed in the sense that I can't remember what happened more than five minutes ago, and in extreme cases, I am not able to form sentences or articulate thoughts well at all. When really major things happen when I am blacking out, I do sometimes recall them in a dream-like way. So I spend a lot of my time \"dreaming\", if you will. \n\nAnd so all of this was surely one of the factors, in my opinion. I mean, if someone who is used to sleeping with me regularly, with whom I usually share a bed with naked every evening, does not get to have sex with me for many days in a row, then that would surely increase my chances of getting raped by him (not that it should in an ideal world, but humans are still just animals). So I said to myself that if I was just able to have sex more often then maybe I would have been turned on at that time and wanted to have sex. It didn't feel like I was blaming myself at all at the time because he often would say to me that he was confused if I wanted sex or not if I was partially or completely naked (should have been a red flag). As I said, I don't have a lot of pride, so when I am in my own living space, I am often naked, no matter who is over. Since he told me every day that he loved me, I just had to believe that he just didn't know that I didn't want to have sex at that time. As I said, I couldn't articulate anything and honestly, I thought I had dreamt it until I saw a little blood down there the next morning (probably TMI, but I let other people decide that). \n\nSo I told myself that it was a communication issue and that I need to be more clear when I want to have sex or not. I started changing my behaviors in really subtle ways, like wearing more clothes when he was around or saying outright that I am not in the mood tonight when I get home.\n\nNothing I could do seemed to stop him from coming over and touching me when I didn't want it. I still was having problems with low libido after the rape, and now I had a sub-conscious aversion to him sexually that I didn't immediately recognize. So I started to spend less time with him until I finally broke up with him because I couldn't take the stress of not knowing when I was sending the wrong signals.\n\nSo we try being friends. We are both logical people after all. Then we go on this camping trip with a few people neither of us had met before and a few really good friends of mine. After the trip, he started telling me that the new people hated me and my behavior was atrocious. I blacked out the whole weekend, so I believed him and got really upset with myself. I write this whole long apology to my good friend since I apparently really offended her friend (whom I hadn't met before this weekend), and she says, \"I had completely forgotten that conversation before you just brought it up, it was that unimportant\".\n\nI started to think about my entire relationship with my now ex after that, and when I confronted him, he admitted that he may have been seeing me in poor light because of the break-up. So, that is when I realized what happened this whole time: when my ex was turned on, he viewed all of my behavior as coming on to him sexually. When my libido was high, this was fine, because he'd turn me on and ... When my libido was low, this manifested with him raping me. It came out in this conversation that he knew I didn't want it at the time, and I was really hurt. I don't talk to him anymore, especially because I still love him.\n\nFast forward a few months (about 6), and now I am still feeling the repercussions of what I thought was harmless analysis of \"cause and effect\". I thought I was just being constructive and pro-active about my growth as an individual at the time. The fine line between \"explaining causation\" and blaming someone. I still have the same negative consequences from that experience that I would if I had outright blamed myself. The fact that it was all dressed up as \"this wasn't my fault, but what could I have done differently\" ultimately changed nothing.\n\nI don't trust my current boyfriend not to rape me. I don't like to be naked around him, even when I don't mind being naked around just about anybody else. When I go through periods of low libido, I feel like I owe him sex.\n\nNobody blamed me for the rape. I didn't even think of it as rape until about a month after the conversation where I stopped talking to my ex entirely. I didn't even think it counted because we were dating at the time. \n\nSo you can take this insight for whatever you'd like. If you want to hear what I think about other particular instances, knowing that I have this unique experience to speak from, then I'd be more than willing.\n\nSearching for cause is no different than searching for blame in the end. Both are just ways to live with the consequences. Searching for cause can be constructive, but it can also be destructive, just as blame can. I learned this the hard way and will be dealing with the consequences for a long while to come.

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Say you are a Goodyear engineer. They want you to design better tires so the company makes more money. You get paid to do this work so you try to design materials that make better tires.\n\nOn the other hand, you are a Goodyear engineer who is tasked to use your knowledge of chemistry and materials to design a system to allow the first man made object to land on Mars. You get paid the same to do this as to just try to come  up with better tire compounds.\n\nBoth projects pay the same, both if successful can lead to new materials and better tires.  As a engineer though I want to get on the Mars mission.  Even though it's harder, more stressful and going to require a lot more work, that is the program I want on, and that is the program I would work like a dog to see succeed.\n\nYou pay the engineer the same either way but the cold statement that he should work hardest to innovate because the species needs him really misses the fact that most engineers are not real motivated by things the species need.\n\nA space program is an example of something that does provide the motivation to get the best efforts from a engineer/scientist.

You have to attack problems on multiple front and having a country united behind a common dream can certainly help on many aspects.

Whether this attack was directly provoked by a printed image of Muhammad or not, my argument will be framed as if it were. I'll paraphrase some of my posts in other threads:\n\nThe problem I have with this is that non-Muslims came out of the blue to offend Muslims on this particular issue. There's no honor in that, we're not on any sort of moral high ground.\n\nConsider this hypothetical: Previously, there was no issue with freedom of expression. Then Some Guy learns that many Muslims forbid printed images of their prophet. Guy says, \"hey, wouldn't it be *just hilarious* if we *printed an image of their prophet*??\" So Guy prints image of their prophet. Angry terrorist coward shoots and kills Guy. Guy's friends call him a martyr, cry censorship. Except there is no censorship, freedom of expression still exists 100%, Guy's publication and others can and likely will post more of these images in the future. \n\nIf a group of people is encroaching upon your rights or beliefs then by all means defend yourself as appropriate. And as I understand it, many Muslim factions are indeed doing that around Europe and there is no insignificant amount of tension. But in this particular instance, *we kindof started it.* We created an issue where there was none.\n\nFreedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? *Absolutely not.* However, what *should be* in this world and *what are* are two completely different things; so, we fight battles to turn the \"what ares\" into the \"should bes.\" Is the battle to print images of Muhammad, among human trafficking and rape and all the other issues, really one we need to be fighting, really worth losing lives over? I guess for some, maybe. I wonder how that policeman and his family feel about it. \n\nSo now, we created a situation where 1) we defend freedom of speech at high cost and continue to print things like this, or 2) we censor ourselves and the turrists win. It's a situation born of childishness that has now ended in tragedy and left us with a difficult path forward. The \"point\" that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs.

Whether this attack was directly provoked by a printed image of Muhammad or not, my argument will be framed as if it were. I'll paraphrase some of my posts in other threads:\n\nThe problem I have with this is that non-Muslims came out of the blue to offend Muslims on this particular issue. There's no honor in that, we're not on any sort of moral high ground.\n\nConsider this hypothetical: Previously, there was no issue with freedom of expression. Then Some Guy learns that many Muslims forbid printed images of their prophet. Guy says, \"hey, wouldn't it be *just hilarious* if we *printed an image of their prophet*??\" So Guy prints image of their prophet. Angry terrorist coward shoots and kills Guy. Guy's friends call him a martyr, cry censorship. Except there is no censorship, freedom of expression still exists 100%, Guy's publication and others can and likely will post more of these images in the future. \n\nIf a group of people is encroaching upon your rights or beliefs then by all means defend yourself as appropriate. And as I understand it, many Muslim factions are indeed doing that around Europe and there is no insignificant amount of tension. But in this particular instance, *we kindof started it.* We created an issue where there was none.\n\nFreedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? *Absolutely not.* However, what *should be* in this world and *what are* are two completely different things; so, we fight battles to turn the \"what ares\" into the \"should bes.\" Is the battle to print images of Muhammad, among human trafficking and rape and all the other issues, really one we need to be fighting, really worth losing lives over? I guess for some, maybe. I wonder how that policeman and his family feel about it. \n\nSo now, we created a situation where 1) we defend freedom of speech at high cost and continue to print things like this, or 2) we censor ourselves and the turrists win. It's a situation born of childishness that has now ended in tragedy and left us with a difficult path forward. The \"point\" that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs.

I'll paraphrase some of my posts in other threads:\n\nThe problem I have with this is that non-Muslims came out of the blue to offend Muslims on this particular issue. There's no honor in that, we're not on any sort of moral high ground.\n\nConsider this hypothetical: Previously, there was no issue with freedom of expression. Then Some Guy learns that many Muslims forbid printed images of their prophet. Guy says, \"hey, wouldn't it be *just hilarious* if we *printed an image of their prophet*??\" So Guy prints image of their prophet. Angry terrorist coward shoots and kills Guy. Guy's friends call him a martyr, cry censorship. Except there is no censorship, freedom of expression still exists 100%, Guy's publication and others can and likely will post more of these images in the future. \n\nIf a group of people is encroaching upon your rights or beliefs then by all means defend yourself as appropriate. And as I understand it, many Muslim factions are indeed doing that around Europe and there is no insignificant amount of tension. But in this particular instance, *we kindof started it.* We created an issue where there was none.\n\nFreedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? *Absolutely not.* However, what *should be* in this world and *what are* are two completely different things; so, we fight battles to turn the \"what ares\" into the \"should bes.\" Is the battle to print images of Muhammad, among human trafficking and rape and all the other issues, really one we need to be fighting, really worth losing lives over? I guess for some, maybe. I wonder how that policeman and his family feel about it. \n\nSo now, we created a situation where 1) we defend freedom of speech at high cost and continue to print things like this, or 2) we censor ourselves and the turrists win. It's a situation born of childishness that has now ended in tragedy and left us with a difficult path forward. The \"point\" that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs.

I would say how you see it depends on your idea of what is worth killing for, what is worth dying/risking death for, and with those things considered,  how societies should deal with people who are willing to kill and/or threaten violence to get their way. \n\nI refuse to get into analogies, because no analogy is perfect, nor will I debate the relative merits of one depiction over another on the legitimate political commentary vs. intentionally inflamatory scale. That's always going to be a matter of opinion, and different for different people. \n\nMy view is that freedom of expression, freedom of (and from) religion should be absolute, sacrosanct, and are worth dying or risking death for. \n\nI believe people who are willing to kill, threaten to kill, or threaten violence in order to supress those freedoms should be dealt with harshly, and should never get their way by employing those methods. \n\nFinally, and key to your arguments here, I do not believe this can be handled on a case by case basis, because then it becomes subjective. I will happily agree that much of the satire directed at all religions is in poor taste, inflamatory, and devoid of any real artistic or political merit. In my opinion.

They did it because they believed that Islam was promoting violence and hatred, based on the writings of its founder and they wanted to satirize this.\n\nWhether they were right or wrong about this is pretty much besides the point.

What happed is that this resulted in death threats and even attempts at killing those responsible. \n\nThe more recent publications along these lines have to be viewed in light of this kind of reaction.

Can we figure out plumbing questions without training in plumbing?\n\nThese value decisions (and value is just one kind of philosophical question we deal with constantly) can be based on valid or invalid arguments. If no one studies arguments of value, why do you believe that we can naturally recognize these with no study? Why do you think we should start from scratch in all value decisions rather than seeking to understand the work that has been done in the past?\n\nA lot of philosophy seems to be common sense just because it's been so thoroughly integrated into our culture. The place that we're currently at though is the result of a lot of work in ethics, epistemology and metaphysics. To assume we can arrive at the best answers just by thinking hard is ignoring the work that got us where we are, both in failing to understand how much labor was required to get us here, and failing to challenge some of our current baseline.\n\nNot everyone needs to study philosophy for their day to day lives, but everyone consumes it whether they know it or not. If no one studies it, then no one will be able to teach it. If no one is able to teach it, then everyone's philosophical positions will have no rigor, will make no use of the work that has already been done before.\n\nAll our philosophical questions then may as well be answered by /r/showerthoughts or /r/trees.

Again, have a look at the field of cognitive science right now, it's full of philosophers who are helping advance and shape our understanding of the human mind.  I also mentioned John Bowlby and Jean Piaget, two 20th century psychologists who developed hugely influential theories in their field that they have *explicitly stated were influenced by the work of philosophers.*  These aren't just examples of people who \"might have read some philosophy sometime\", these are people that credit philosophers for contributing to and influencing their work *directly*.  I talked about human rights, which have only over the last 50 years been codified in institutions like the UN and which continue to shape us culturally, which have been established, debated, and continue to be debated, *philosophically.*  I mentioned that the logic that powers our computers was developed over centuries by philosophers.

That doesn't mean they aren't also important questions and it doesn't mean they don't profoundly shape and affect our world, as I've also explained at great length (with specific examples), and yet you seem unwilling to engage with it.  So at this stage, again, why should I take you seriously?  You're not asking questions and genuinely looking for the answers.  You're starting with the answer and framing loaded questions to arrive back at it.  That's a logical fallacy.  You would get torn apart if you submitted this argument in a first year philosophy class, both in your comprehension of others' points, and in the framing and logic of your own.  You yourself, I suggest, would benefit greatly from a basic introductory course in philosophy.\n\nThe original question wasn't whether philosophy invents things, whether it discovers hard facts about the world, or whether it reaches unequivocal solutions to specific problems.  That's *your* question and as I've explained, it's a poorly framed one that fundamentally misunderstands what philosophy is in the first place.

If you know philosophy then you know the origin and reasons for your assumptions, and the assumptions of others. This aids in outside-the-box thinking and in preventing making stupid or typical mistakes, and arms you with problem solving.\n\nRacism is an example. Many folks believe today that racism is an inevitable human condition that's always been, unaware of how it originated extremely recently. In other words, if you showed the Ancient Romans the death camps of World War II at the height of their troubles with Judea, they'd consider the 20th Century man a total savage and demon. This is because even in Ancient Rome there were ethnically Italian slaves, and Jews who were Roman citizens. The division was political, which is why they published the idea of conversion and ruled many foreign lands without disenfranchising the local populations. In fact, Rome brought them the polis, or the city, and considered themselves liberators and luminaries. They wouldn't have considered themselves \"ethnically Roman\".\n\nRacism was a result of globalism, missionary work and colonialism, American law (men had rights, so to justify slaves there was an incentive to say that Africans were not fully human, and like a beast of burden), and in the 1930s genetics and statistics were taking off. This is the source of racism, or the unique idea that humans are different \"breeds\" and the \"superman\"--which you wont find in history anywhere else.\n\nThe closest thing to racism in the ancient world was tribalism and nationalism, in which people considered \"their people\" like you might consider your family compared to other families. See Asia. There was pride and conflict and even horror, but ideas like genetic superiority and that other people were an infestation would be unthinkable.\n\nWithout philosophy you don't understand the history of ideas, and so you might be inclined to think your assumptions are yours, a consequence of experience, and quite magical. The final result of this [is very ugly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism_%28psychology%29), and less likely if you know the roots of your views and others."}, {"id": "2rmy6e", "body": "As an independent form of study, philosophy doesn't seem to have any practical applications.
