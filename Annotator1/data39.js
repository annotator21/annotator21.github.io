I grew up southern baptist so I'll say this experience speaks for some moderately active evangelical Protestants. In the main church service after hymns and prayers, a bible verse is read. Then (usually) the pastor gives a sermon on it, giving some real life examples, maybe talking about the culture at the time it was written, what it means about God, etc. Until I was 16 or so I went to Sunday school every Sunday too, we read through most of the Old Testament and I took classes on the structure and history of the bible, probably at age 13 I could tell you roughly what was in all the books of the bible. The gospels are obviously the most important, and I memorized a good 50-75 verses at some point with a school program. My parents bought me a bible and I read it probably 2-3 times a week just on my own, one year I went to a camp and got a \"read the bible in a year\" books, quit after a bit when I got bogged down into the names. My grandmother, when we lived with her for a while, read every night from these publications that had a paragraph or so of bible verse and then had a short commentary on them. My dad (was a minister, now a hospital chaplain) reads the bible everyday at breakfast.

In your giant silver hand writing on your wall metaphor - you forget that the wall is already god's creation, as are people and cars and the sky and so forth. \n\n\nIt may still be worthwhile to pursue the texts, in order to become a scholar or to join the clergy, or help someone in particular or whatever else, but these are practical goals subject to practical limitations.

Religious books give you a wide range of advice about moral and ethical matters, knowledge of certain historical events, and a promise that some sort of relationship with spiritual entities will grant you spiritual powers or a privileged afterlife. \n\nA sense of awe requires either an emotional reaction to this or a rational reaction.\n\nEmotionally, our brains have only so much love to give. They are made of neurones which fire electrical signals, they can only fire so fast. Our brain can count up to about 3, beyond that you memorize numbers studies on charitable giving find that people give about the same amount to save 10 birds as 10 million. Our brain doesn't have any conception of what infinite means. We're also very driven by impulses. We like to eat, drink, have friends and such. The sense of awe is heavily tempered by the fact that the insights aren't immediately helpful and other things get in the way.\n\nSo you open the alien book, hoping to find alien technologies and tricks and ideas. They have some sort of creation story, telling of how they evolved ages ago. It's a bit dull. Your brain doesn't care about infinite, it cares about getting what you want. Frustrated, you put it down.\n\nThen you want to eat and drink so you go to work really tired. You work late because your boss demanded it, you come home. You pick up the book again. You read a bit further. They have a rather dry account of them conquering other nations and becoming the dominant race. Nothing of direct use yet. You get rather bored and watch tv instead for a bit, call your mother, go buy groceries, go meet a friend.\n\nThe weekend rolls around, you've been putting off reading the book. But this time you're ready. You skim the book, looking for easily accessible things to stop your life being so shitty.\n\n...and yeah, there is a system. You can call out to the aliens and they may decide to help you. You can do certain actions and maybe become a representative but from what you read, all of those dudes died really bloody deaths. You find a ready moral system. There are the 16 commands of zzryzorp for living a good life, some nice stories about their interstellar travels you can use. You resolve to use these in your life. \n\nYou're pretty tired after this, so you spend some time with your friends drinking. You go on CMV for some discussion. You think about the book a lot. \n\nThen on sunday your boss calls you. He tells you there's a promotion coming up and that if you came to work on a sunday maybe you can get it. You guess you'll have to look over the book later. You have the basic principles, they're enough, and it doesn't look like there are any easy hacks in the book. It's all about hard work. \n\nThere's another route to awe. Relationships.\n\nSuppose this girl who guided you around was really nice. Charismatic, attractive, even the tentacles were a pro. She really made you feel good about yourself, she really got you. She says that if you follow what the book said maybe you'll get to see her again.\n\nThat's a much bigger pull. You read the book a lot more ferverently, trying to get some sort of idea of what she likes. You try the communication thing, seeing if you can message her. It's a bit hard to communicate across the depths of space but you think you heard something. \n\nWhen your boss tells you to work extra hours you say no- you prefer to work on your relationship than to fix up your car or buy a better phone. You even give a donation to the local aquarium, as you must love your squid like yourself, first commandment. \n\nThis is how most religions work. You don't get sucked in by mystical/ super tech stuff, rather obviously religion doesn't give most people magical powers. Some cults try to claim they do, but clearly they lie. Our brain has a much stronger desire system for relationships than other things, so you have god the father, my buddy jesus, we are sisters of islam.

You say if people believe that the Bible is God's own word then people should devote their life to it. And in a way your right. People should devote time into their religious text, but its not the only way to connect to God. \n\nThe way i feel your seeing it is like this, because the Bible is a physical medium directly inspired by God then that is THE BEST (if not only) way to truly learn about and connect to God.

Although having this religious text it great one can fine God in many other ways, in fact even better ways then reading the Bible. \n\nTheir was once a time where their wasn't many religious text. Moses didnt connect to God by sitting down with a couple hundred scrolls. The disciples of Jesus didn't learn about Gods glory by sitting down with a nice cup of coffee and the bible. They learned and grew closer to God by faith and prayer. \n\nThe thing is that christians believe we have a living God, and one that still communicates and guides us each day. Just because we are not adding to the Bible doesnt mean that in todays world things are not happening that are worthy to be written about. You could memorize the whole Bible cover to cover and still have more to learn about God.\n\nWe learn from God and grow closer to him not by dedication to the Bible but dedication to him. We dont exactly need Gods word to be burned into our minds because we believe that the Holy Sprite guides our hearts.\n\nWhen it all comes down to it, yes the Bible is good, and yes we should at least read it once before we click the subscribe button, but the bible is a small part of knowing God.

I am not especially familiar with Christianity, but I know most serious Christians send their kids to church school once a week, and if they go to a Christian school they might even have a class for it that is counted as a school subject.  I was raised Jewish and we went to Hebrew school twice a week where we'd learn about the to Torah/bible, and then we would attend a service every week where the week's Torah portion was read and interpreted.  I did't learn much Hebrew, because my temple was reformed, but many Jews who do learn Hebrew are learning an entire language just to understand the prayers and the bible.  That seems like a lot of effort going into learning about this text, a lot more than any other book you'll ever read.\n\nAlso, if everyone dropped all they were doing to learn the text our society would not be very productive.  Some people do spend all their time studying religious texts, but it is not the norm, nor should it be.  We could certainly all sit around all day and argue about the meaning of such and such passage of whatever text, but why should we need everyone to do that?  \n\nGoing off your analogy, it's like the giant hand left these writings thousands of years ago, not to you specifically but to everyone who was then or would ever be a part of its religion.  Your ancestors studied these writings for thousands of years, and you yourself have spent hours each week for your entire life studying these writings.  So now this text of the hand is sitting on your desk and you're looking at memes.  You don't go \"Oh wow!  A book that I've read dozens of times and spent years studying!

More than college, more than the latest novel, more than socializing, etc. I for one would drop everything to focus exclusively on it and any other action, given confidence in that knowledge, seems insane to me.\n\nIn this sense I feel like older religious traditions (Jewish Torah scholarship, Muslim memorization of the Quran, Christian monks secluding themselves for religious contemplation and study, etc.) which placed extreme emphasis on their holy books were acting far more rationally.\n\nTo give an analogy for how I feel, it would be like if I was sitting on reddit and a giant glowing hand burst through my bedroom wall and began to write a letter on my wall for me starting with \"Dear Bezant,\" and I just thought \"Ehhhh, I wonder if there's any funny new memes today?\" then a few days later asked my roommate if anything in the letter seared onto my wall seemed important.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the debate all!

There have been a few decent arguments but I feel they're missing OPs point. \n\nI come from a catholic family here in Portugal, we're not extremely religious but we do go to church every Sunday. I doubt more than a handful in our family has read the bible, I sure havent. The point is, people like us, casual practising catholics which I think are the majority of religious people, are very selfish religiously. By this I mean we just want to take whatever helps us feel good spiritously and fulfill our duties with the Lord to the minimum. Holy redemption is not that fearsome to us - we know jesus is good and if we behave we'll get in heaven. The most important thing is having faith. Why would we study the bible? I feel like your analogy bypasses this whole shallowness that religion usually has, since the bible is not put in front of us by god so bluntly like that. Its very open to interpretation and what everyone goes by is \"Act like Jesus did\", just be a good person.\n\nAlso, the only duty I feel we have is going to church (even that I feel is optional) and nobody ever told us or taught us we should read the bible.

This is done in anticipation that tips will make up the difference (at the very least) in terms of their hourly wage to keep them above the $7.25 limit.\n\n[Recent changes](http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm#California) in california state law have changed the minimum wage of servers to $9 irrespective of tipping.  That is to say, if restaurants are paying servers less then $9/hour excluding tips, they are breaking the law.  Due to this shift in the fundamental nature of compensation, I feel that in California, we should switch to the tipping norms found in Europe and many asian countries, that is to say tipping is not required.

It may not cause the smoker discomfort, but why is there unhealthy habit held above all other's comfort?\n\nAllowing this air pollution causes discomfort that /u/dewprisms already went into.  Furthermore, not limiting air pollution is a dangerous precedent.  Consider the abysmal state of air quality in large Chinese cities.  Smog of all kinds should be regulated by the government.\n\nFurther health risks include those to young children.   Young children are far more sensitive to the effects of bad air quality.  They could become significantly harmed by this dangerous habit.\n\nFurthermore, there is evidence that even [brief exposure](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/general_facts/) to secondhand smoke can be harmful.  I'd like to point you to the section about the effects on children.  It is absolutely abhorrent to allow people to make children experience these clearly terrible effects.  Another quote is also especially interesting:\n\n&gt;For nonsmokers, breathing secondhand smoke has immediate harmful effects on the cardiovascular system that can increase the risk for heart attack.

These typically cause respiratory distress on varying levels.\n\n&gt; **How is ETS Linked to Allergies and Asthma in Children?**\n\n&gt; Children are especially at risk of lung damage and illness from inhaled smoke. Studies have shown a clear link between ETS and asthma in young people. Passive smoking worsens asthma in teens and may cause up to 26,000 new cases of asthma each year. It is also linked to hundreds of thousands of infections of the lower respiratory tract (the lungs and lower airways) in infants under 18 months. These infections in turn lead to thousands of hospitalizations of children each year. The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome quadruples if the mother or both parents are smokers.\n\n&gt; Children exposed to ETS are more likely to have reduced lung function and symptoms of respiratory irritation, such as coughing, wheezing and excess phlegm (fluid in the lungs and airways). Children with allergies and nasal congestion who are also exposed to tobacco smoke are up to six times more likely than others to have persistent middle ear infections requiring the surgical insertion of tubes.\n\n[Source.](http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=8&amp;sub=17&amp;cont=179)"}, {"id": "2qejwv", "body": "I think that smoking bans for the most part are completely propaganda driven and find it unfortunate people are buying it.
