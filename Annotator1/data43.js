From what I can tell, there is very little skill involved in playing the game, it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through.\n\n\"Monopoly\" was made with the intent to explain why localised monopolies are bad for the economy and to explain the Single Tax theory of Henry George.^1 Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once ~50% of the board has been claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another's territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.\n\nWhile this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players. One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few. At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going, because it would be \"unfair\" to keep going despite the likely outcome.\n\nIf Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance (perhaps a redesign of the board, more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better \"Chance\" cards, or even removal of the pieces entirely) and to be quicker (Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily, for example) then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone. As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.\n\nPlease change my view, for the sake of family game night. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt;^1 Orbanes, Philip E.

In any group of people any one person has an equal chance of winning as long as they don't play stupidly."}, {"id": "cn50r8t", "body": "Well, I learned that there are Monopoly Tournament rules today. I could try to argue that the rule you're talking about only means that there's no official support for immunity (meaning that if you gave immunity for a space and then broke it, there's no penalty), but even I know that's a stretch. A better argument might be that a family playing at home shouldn't be bound to Tournament rules, since the tournament rules are clarifications designed for serious players, not the casual players that just play with friends or family. Tournament-level players don't need the protection of immunity to feel comfortable trading, but casual players (especially children) often do. This could make allowing immunity a rule interpretation suitable for casual, but not tournament play.\n\nHowever, arguing against official rules leaves a bad taste in my mouth, so I'll just suggest Immunity as a strongly recommended house rule. Immunity could theoretically make the game go longer (since there are some rent payments being ignored), but I find that the huge incentive it gives to trades tends to help people form monopolies and ends the game quicker.\n\nAs to your other points, the first person to get a set is certainly at an advantage, but that advantage should not be insurmountable if the other players work together. If A, B, C, and D are playing and A gets the first monopoly, that shouldn't just be that. B, C, and D should immediately be negotiating to help each other form monopolies so A doesn't get too far ahead. C can help B complete his Orange group, while B helps C complete his Yellow group. Both get monopolies, and are back on even footing with A. Even without offering \"immunity\", that kind of mutualistic trade is 100% kosher.  Playing like this, most players should be getting monopolies around the same time, leveling the playing field.\n\nAlso, while Monopoly certainly has a comparatively heavy amount of luck involved, it can be mitigated by player actions. Look at the three phases of the game:\n\nEarly-game: Players go around using their initial bankroll to buy what properties they can land on. This stage balances itself relatively naturally with the auction rule. Since no player can buy everything they land on, even a player with bad rolling luck can still clean up at the auctions. Coming out of this stage with four competent players, they should all have roughly the same amount/value of property. No one should be at a huge disadvantage coming out of this stage, and if they are, it's because they got unlucky with rolling and handled the auctions poorly (the auctions are the earliest diplomatic part of the game to come up).\n\nMid-game: Players try to complete sets by whatever means necessary, and begin building up a few houses. This is where the brunt of the trading is done, and that's the biggest diplomatic skill in the game. There's generally very little luck in this stage of the game. The trading done here sets the stage for the end-game, and plays the largest part in deciding who will win it. No one should fall too far behind in this phase due to anything other than player skill (like I said before, if A gets a set, the other players should take that as their cue to cut the crap and start trading to make their own).\n\nEnd-game: Ideally, no one has lost before this phase. If they have, it's likely due to a failure to auction and trade successfully. Players top off their sets with as many houses and hotels as they can, while going around the board and slowly getting bankrupted. This phase has general strategic decisions to be made (e.g. where should I put my next house, when should I put that hotel down, what should I mortgage) that require player skill. The dice do contribute a heavy amount of luck to the end-game, but the point of all that came before it is to stack those odds in your favor as best as possible. While it is definitely possible for a player who was less successful at auctioning and trading to win through some lucky rolls, it is much more likely for a player who was more diplomatically and strategically successful to come out on top. If all players are equally good, then there should be a roughly equally chance to win, which is appropriate. If one player is better, they are more likely to win, but worse players still have a chance to make a comeback.\n\nMonopoly certainly has luck at the end, but the rest of the game is designed so that the players configure the board to give themselves the best possible odds."}, {"id": "cn4iftv", "body": "First, are you actually playing monopoly according to the base rules?

Living 90 years and hating 70 of them seems pointless when you put that next to living 30 or 40 years and hating maybe ten of them.\n\nWe're *all* trying to outrun deep, serious suffering; you're doing it with Wendy's and cable TV, we're doing it with experiences. People inoculate themselves with cat videos and shitty TV to experience the things they once could go out and do but now have to do them through someone else on a screen."}, {"id": "cn4tf1h", "body": "dude..I wanna smoke pot with you so badly!"}, {"id": "cn4tf1h", "body": "dude..I wanna smoke pot with you so badly!"}, {"id": "cn4um3l", "body": "Which is kind of funny because I don't smoke or use pot XD"}, {"id": "cn4h0nr", "body": "&gt;  \"fuck it, im going to do all these drugs, blow my money, travel, have sex, get to know as many people as possible and die when i die?\"\n\nI think it's a romantic notion, but it's fiction.

Just listened to that chapter again on audiobook- he mentioned:\n\n* avoiding toxins: obviously don't sniff glue, stand upwind when fueling your car, but also be very careful of alcohol consumption. Alcohol works by depriving brain cells of oxygen. The 'buzz' you feel is the feeling of neurons drowning. \n* avoiding inflammation: When your immune system activates to deal with an infection or allergen, it sends chemical messengers called cytokines throughout the body. Cytokines will linger in the brain after the infection or allergen is dealt with, causing a down and depressed mood. So taking steps to reduce inflammation will help here- washing hands often, eliminating foods that set off your immune system. An easy way to do this is to eliminate dairy and gluten from your diet for 2 weeks. If you feel any better, either keep them out of your diet permanently, or add in one and see if it's the other one that makes you feel worse. \n* get regular exercise: exercise promotes the growth of new neural structures including new brain cells. \n* relax: the stress hormone- cortisol- inhibits and may even shrink the hippocampus, which is responsible for stopping and regulating stress. So the more stress you experience, the easier it is to become and stay stressed in the future. The hippocampus is also responsible for other things such as being able to put your feelings in context and being able to learn new things, so reducing stress by taking time to relax (good ways to relax are another chapter in the book, which I can summarize if it'd be helpful) helps you not feel overwhelmed by your feelings.

"}, {"id": "cn4vghx", "body": "So I decided to reply to you because you remind me quite a bit of myself about 12 years ago when I was 19.\n\nI had the same kind of outlook, and basically thought \"in 200 years from now, no one will care what I did, so why don't I just live fast, have fun, do what I want and how I want it?\" I Idolized Hunter S. Thompson for setting the date on which he would blow his head off after living so fast, and he sure did - can't get any more badass than that can it?\n\nI was 19, and decided, exactly as you describe, that I would say \"fuck it, im going to do all these drugs, blow my money, travel, have sex, get to know as many people as possible and die when i die.\" Honestly, I couldn't have put this better myself, that's exactly what I did - I grabbed a rucksack and hitchhiked across the country that day on a whim, to do my dream of travelling and nothing else, I did almost any drug, had sex a bunch of times, and partied and traveled, traveled and traveled - exactly what I wanted to do, at any time.\n\nSo great, right? Well that's the thing...it was great at first, but then I started missing having a bed, I started missing fresh home cooked food, and I started missing having people I love around me, so eventually I came back. I told myself it would only be for 6 months, and I would travel again, and I did! This time, I was able to get a job with some cash, and got to go overseas and repeat the adventure all over again, except in freaking Europe! \n\nWell, this time was even more fun, but it cost a lot more too. Also, people weren't as friendly as they were back home when I was hiking, because well...I didn't seem like I needed help, and if I did, no one really cared of took pity, because I was just some dumb tourist. I was more worried about doing hard drugs because I got robbed once, so I mainly stuck with pot for now. Alright, fair enough, but I still had a kick ass time! So I went back home after a few months, planning to repeat the process.\n\nExcept, when I got back home, I realized that everyone wasn't impressed, or amazed that I was travelling so much, or living like this...no one really cared. I also realized that I was starting to lose touch with some of my other friends, because when I would get back *I* had changed, and no one else had. Well, wtv, they didn't understand, I was living the *fast life* doing what I wanted.\n\nRince, repeat. Trip #3 was even more awesome, Africa was beautiful, and I saw SO many things I never dreamed I would ever see! Except...well, every time I saw something amazing, I couldn't help wish I had someone next to me...someone to share this amazing moment with. I took pictures and videos, but they weren't really the same...and no one really cared when I got back, when I tried to show it to them....hmm...okay, still an amazing time though!\n\nRince repeat.\n\nRince...repeat. \n\n30 countries, 35 countries....except, it's starting to get expensive now. So I work along the way, taking longer trips, but making pretty measly wages...I'm also getting a bit older, and the drugs just aren't as fun as they were, but travelling is still amazing! Very happy I never had kids...and I smoke green, but haven't touched anything else in a while.\n\nSo after my 7th or 8th trip, I realize something... I'm kinda getting bored of travelling...well, not of travelling, but of always be in the state of travelling. I start looking forward to getting home, and a warm bed, and certainty, and a routine....weird. That's not me.\n\n10th trip was great, but I was almost *homesick* before I got back - wtf?\n\nThis time I took a long breath, and decided two things 1) I was tired of working shitty jobs, and 2) I (begrudgingly) admitted that I kind of like having a more secure place to live...better furniture, better appliances...not living in a tent for weeks... hmmm. This is about 7 years after my original trip, mind you.\n\nSo, I make a decision on a whim - I'm going to get a degree, let's do this. I apply and get in, yay! Awesome. I decide I'll still travel during the summer months, and pay off my loans while travelling once I'm done, great.\n\nDuring my last year, opportunity knocks and I'm offered a really good position when I graduate. Uh-oh. Remember, I'm living life in the fast lane, and this would reduce that lane to 4 weeks vacation a year...but I would get a nice bed to sleep on and a warm apartment all to myself. Hmmm... Nah, I'll skip it. Trip # 11. Amazing time. Still lonely.\n\nI get back, and call the HR rep up, and ask him if the spot is still available. It is. I take it. What. \n\nI get into the job...fancy, I have to wear a tie and shit. But people also seem to like me, and my travel stories, alright. They even respect me, great! My paycheck - holly shit. I make in a week what I used to make in a month, wow! I could travel so long with this!\n\nI book my month off for South America, better than nothing! Except this time I'm loaded, and I rent a car and hostels for the trip, instead of campgrounds and busrides - what a difference! My back hurts a lot after long periods of bus rides and uncomfortable beds, and those changes really help me enjoy myself, instead of struggling so much. I'm getting older after all.\n\nThen, I meet her. I fall in love. She loves me back. She also loves travelling!\n\nShe wants kids.\n\nUh oh.\n\nWait...why uh oh? I evaluate...I ...do I actually want kids now too? I dunno...I had dismissed that Idea years ago, but in a way, after seeing all my friends and how happy and proud they are...I can see myself having kids, but only because it's with her. Wow. I slow down on the drugs, I smoke once a week now, if that, and I'm ok with it, I kind of like my clear mind lately..\n\nThis is when I made a startling realization - I've changed. If I was given the opportunity to leave it all again, and hitchhike...I don't think I would. I'm comfortable and don't really want to leave her side. Also, when I had more money, the trips were more fun and I was able to do a lot more stuff. I like this new gig.\n\nShe promises we are still going to travel, and indeed we have a 5 week trip booked for Australia and NZ in February. \n\nThat's where I'm at now.\n\n\n\nI figure you already know where I'm going with this, but my main point is this - having the mindset that you have is not only normal, in my opinion it's great. You know how people always tell you to travel when you're young, otherwise you won't do it? They blame having kids or buying a house as the main reason, but there is another - yourself.\n\nSee, when you are younger you are invincible and you would love nothing else but to tell the world to shove it and do whatever you want - and in my opinion, you absolutely should.\n\nBut, and here is where I argue against your post - in 5, in 10, in 20 years, you will *not* be the person who is having these thoughts today. Everyone changes, even you, so even though you *think* you want to live fast, and hard now, future you might change her mind. You might not want kids now, but you may later. You may be ok with constant travelling now, but you might not be later. \n\nI fully encourage you to go for broke right now, because now is the time to do it - go, do it, get broke, fuck up, leave, come back, do whatever you want!... but please, please, and please, be \n\n1) smart about it and \n\n2) don't do anything that is irreversible. \n\nand \n\n3) Don't travel on debt, it WILL catch up to you. If you can manage to work a bit and stay above 0$, you can go on indefinitely, but travelling on debt only means paying more later, or putting yourself in a shitty situation.\n\nFuture you will absolutely thank you, and there is no reason that you cannot go have the time of your life, as *if* you are never going to change, but the quicker you realize that it might be temporary, and plan for such, the quicker you will give yourself a chance to change your mind in the future, which, speaking from experience, you more than likely will.\n\n&gt;\"im of the opinion that you as a person, comes first. and what you want to do should take priority. \n\nYou *should* come first, but don't assume that what you want today is what you will want tomorrow.\n\n&gt;\"you should also take the greatest care to minimize harm in such circumstance\" \n\nExactly! But don't forget that also means long term harm, not only immediate. \n\n&gt;\"unless you truly dont give a damn. then, does what is wrong/right really matter?\"\"\n\nI feel where you are coming from, but don't forget that you may actually give a damn later on...it might not matter now, but it might later. \n\nBe smart, but go for it, and have fun. In the words of a great singer - \n\n\"But if you wanna leave, take good care\nI hope you make a lot of nice friends out there\nBut just remember there's a lot of bad and beware\"\n\nDon't let your ego convince you that this is what you want to do for the rest of your life....really listen to who you are and don't be afraid to change. Keep that in mind, and then go out and have a blast. Be safe, read up and make friends.\n\n...Good luck.\n\n"}, {"id": "2qaw9l", "body": "I guess this is a popular notion for celebrities who get caught up in the partying lifestyle and end up dying from that.

Living without regard for your future physical and mental health is a good way to ensure that the bulk of your life will be a lot less glamorous than you imagine it to be now.  Unless you intend to kill yourself at some point (in which case you should see a doctor) you probably won't die young and will have to deal with a long life of feeling burnt out and broken with nothing to show for it.  That's not to say you can't take drugs, spend money, have sex, travel and get to know as many people as possible.  With some common sense, self discipline and honesty you can do all these things while still providing for your future happiness.  Try and take steps to ensure that your quality of life is constantly getting better rather than constantly deteriorating (which it will if you live a self-destructive lifestyle as you are proposing) and you can enjoy every stage of your life, not just the first 5-10 years of adulthood.

I don't necessarily know that talking about my own demons is all that helpful, but they're not always things that I can talk about in real life, and perhaps if I talk about them maybe you'll be able to relate or find some answer somewhere, at the very least it's probably good for me to write these down.\n\nI'm a sophomore at an Ivy League school (I only mention that because its relevant to a lot of my life choices/questions), and everyday I question my path.  Obviously I haven't really lived a hedonistic lifestyle sacrificing my future for the now, and if anything I ascribe to the \"work hard, play hard\" philosophy, but work definitely always comes first.  Anyway the path I'm on, or at least the one I hope I'm on (or the one I think I hope I'm on) is to graduate, hopefully get some flashy job in New York or Boston, maybe get an MBA, and work my way up the  ladder of the finance world.\n\nI mention all of this because I think it's a very strange path in that it falls neither under the live fast die young philosophy (its far too structured, mapped out, and requires too much work), nor does it fall under the simple pleasure, raise a family in the suburbs path.  The latter path has always repulsed me.  Call it youth (and it probably is), but the idea of working some regular job with normal hours and earning 80k/yr while living a boring lifestyle seems so bleh and not at all fulfilling.  The idea of average has never appealed to me.\n\nOn the flip side, there are plenty of problems with the other lifestyle.  Is working 80+ hours a week and spending my little free time either exhausted or drunk and partying really all that much better?  I've always thought that it would be better to work really hard for 15-20 years and be something as opposed to work a typical 9-5 job for 40 years with an average wife in an average house.  At the same time though, in the Wall St. lifestyle I'm essentially just a slave to a system and in neither scenario am I really following a passion.  \n\nThat brings me to a third scenario that I think a lot about and that is the idea of following a dream, be it writing a screenplay or writing comedy, etc.  Of course if I was exceptionally successful in either one of those, then yes I might find true happiness, but there's such a small chance of that happening.  There's always the very real possibility that I flop and I feel like I'd never get over throwing away my future.  There's also the decent chance that I experience mild success and essentially get sucked into the LA lifestyle (which as bad as it sounds greatly appeals to me right now) the kind of live fast, die young lifestyle you describe in your OP.  Never achieving true peace, but spending my time doing drugs, having sex and being a selfish degenerate while using my \"art and suffering\" as an excuse for my behavior.  And I have to say that doesn't sound half bad. Which of course also makes me hesitate.  Would I really truly be following a dream of writing or would I really be following a dream of a lifestyle, while using my writing as a vessel to chase that lifestyle?\n\nThe older I get (and I realize I'm still young), the more I question whether I'll truly ever be content if I don't experience at least a few years of that hedonistic, sex, drugs and rock n roll lifestyle-at the very least to get it out of my system.  To me that seems almost like the pinnacle of excitement and experiencing life, even if deep down I am running from something.\n\nIt's really hard to know what to make of life sometimes.  Add in the fact that my family doesn't have a lot of money, and that I am in a good position to really reverse that and maybe provide for myself and give them what they need and want and my decisions become even more complicated.  \n\nIf I choose the hedonistic path and fail all I will think about is the opportunities I gave up and how I let down my family, if I choose the work hard, big money lifestyle all I will think about is whether what I get is really worth the countless late nights at the office and 90 hour work weeks, while also thinking about how I never truly got to go and \"sow my oats\".  If I choose the typical boring life I think it's pretty obvious that I'll spend it obsessing over how much easier car payments could be, and how much more I could travel, while obviously also thinking about all of the crazy partying that I never got to enjoy or experience and realizing that from middle age until I die my life is a carefully choreographed pattern of evenings in front of the TV, building a mediocre retirement fund, and eating out at Applebee's on Friday night.\n\nSo...now that I've talked so much about myself (as people love to do), I'm going to give you my piece of advice.  If you don't have any serious reservations about this live fast, die young lifestyle, and you don't feel like you will be giving much up to experience it, and it really is all that appeals to you (these are all big IFs), then I say go for it.  People can talk about how it's not fulfilling, but if you have nothing else that drives you then you're unlikely to find true fulfillment in anything else either.  It is also not a lifestyle that you necessarily have to carry on forever.  If you realize that you really aren't enjoying it is possible to leave it behind (though not always easy).  \n\nWho knows, you and I are both young and naive and maybe we'll meet someone who makes us forget all of these problems, but my opinion is that if you're truly an introspective thinker who is always questioning meaning and existence, then you probably won't ever find the definitively right path and the best you really can do is pick one and go with it.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cn4gvuj", "body": "What is the meaning of life?\n\nIt is (arguably) the most important question in the universe. It is the question that dictates how you, and everyone around you live their lives. I don't believe that we will ever come to a definitive answer, so we have to each answer the question individually. To answer your question in the fullest, you have to answer this question yourself. You have to look deep inside yourself to find what you really value.    \n\nIf you believe that the meaning of life is to have fun moment to moment, then I cannot fault you for coming to the conclusion that \"living fast and dying young\" is a good course of action. \n\nIf you believe that the meaning of life is to \"love and be loved\" then your line of reasoning is completely wrong. Why should I off myself for fun? how would that affect those around me?\n\nIf you believe that the meaning of life is to \"serve your god\" then you shouldn't live recklessly, as that would weaken your relationship with god.\n\nIf you believe that the meaning of life is to \"make a good, lasting impression on the world\" then again, you shouldn't live recklessly, as that would not affect the world in a positive way. \n\nThis entire matter hinges around your answer to that one simple question, and *no one can tell you differently* \n\nI appologize for breaking the \"you must directly challenge at least one aspect of the OP's stated view\" rule. instead of doing this, I explained my view on this topic. Hopefully readers will recognize that understanding this is important to actually answering OP's question.

It is a question with one definitive answer: to perpetuate its own existence.\n\n\nhowever the *meaning* of life is something much more profound. The *meaning* of life is the (philosophical) reason that life exists. It has nothing to do with science, and cannot be definitively proven. It varies from person to person and is perhaps the most interesting question in the universe. It has no provable answer and is at the heart of nearly every conflict known to man.\n\nHope that clarifies my last comment."}, {"id": "2qaw9l", "body": "I guess this is a popular notion for celebrities who get caught up in the partying lifestyle and end up dying from that.

He wants to ride roller coasters all day long, and OD on sugary candy. Of course he's not interested in school or relationships (cooties!). \n\nSo what will likely happen? Let's assume he lives, them he will probably have horrible teeth and no education, which will make the rest of his life significantly worse. Furthermore, it's likely that as he tried up his interest in roller coasters and candy will decrease anyway, so he might feel like he wasted part of his life that could have been better spent from the perspective from his future self.\n\nIf he died, then he probably had fun going out, but it still feels like a tragic waste.\n\nAnyway, what I'm trying to say is: having such a lifestyle can be bad for your health and fuck you up physically or mentally (look at those rock stars that start getting dementia at age 40). Furthermore it's likely that in 5-10 years you won't be as interested in those things anyway, and would wish you'd have spent them differently (for instance studying or building meaningful relationships). \n\nI know it's difficult to imagine changing as a person because you can't see yourself thinking differently than you do now, but it'll happen continuously throughout your life.

Often the only warnings are that older people tell you to take their word for it and you'll be glad you did, but you think, \"No way will that ever apply to me.\"\n\nAs a thought experiment, perhaps think if you got your way at some earlier stages in your life. At 7, maybe you would have chosen candy and no school. Well, you might have had a lot of problems in the restroom and now you may not even be able to read or post this question on Reddit.

Often the only warnings are that older people tell you to take their word for it and you'll be glad you did, but you think, \"No way will that ever apply to me.\"\n\nAs a thought experiment, perhaps think if you got your way at some earlier stages in your life. At 7, maybe you would have chosen candy and no school. Well, you might have had a lot of problems in the restroom and now you may not even be able to read or post this question on Reddit. It'd be even worse if all that candy made you fat with possibly other physical problems.\n\nSo there are two elements of harm in the story above: Physical and educational.\n\nThe simple fact is at every age, you're still you.

You're choosing the wrong one.\n\nIf you want to see what your choice has in store for you, some Tuesday afternoon take a drive out to a bad part of town, and go into the shittiest bar you can find. Have a look a the women there. That's where your life is going to lead you. Bad teeth, terrible tattoos, and either skin falling off a skeleton or a bulging belly. That's what you have to look forward to. The people in your life aren't interesting, they're sleazebags. Boozing, drugs, and partying might be fun in your early twenties, but it gets old fast. You end up fucking gross people and ostracizing friends and family. Sex and drugs give you instant gratification, but your life will always feel meaningless because there's no reward after the fact.\n\nThe other choice is to actually have meaningful fun. There's tons of people who live their lives doing exactly what they want to do and having fun every single day. In my mid twenties after a bad breakup I made a decision to live for myself for a while. Living for myself doesn't mean seeking instant gratification; it means getting the most fulfillment possible out of every moment. I started skydiving, and set a goal of one day piloting wingsuits. I started rockclimbing and iceclimbing, and I'm now in the planning stages of some major ascents in the Peruvian Andes. Everything I do has a good chance of killing me. I'm living in every moment. I love my life.\n\nI was you one day. I was looking for a feeling I couldn't describe, and I didn't know exactly what it was until I felt it. I did a lot of drugs trying to find it. My best advice for you is to try skydiving.

I mean literally nobody. I'm not saying that there is nobody in the world who does something to note that Kwanzaa is happening, but it is rare enough that I've never come across anyone.\n\nWhen I got into work today I noticed  that the lobby was all decorated for the holidays. There was a big silver and red ornament hanging over the door. There was a really big decorated tree. A little off to the right there was a lighted menorah displayed in a festive scene. And on the left there was candelabra type thing with the word \"Kwanzaa\" written on it.\n\nIt got me thinking, \"Why the heck is that Kwanzaa thing there\"? Nobody celebrates it. It doesn't add anything to the display. Aside from knowing that it is some kind of \"black Christmas\" nobody even knows anything about it. \n\nThen it hit me. Our company wants to show their \"commitment to diversity\" and this is what they came up with... a meaningless gesture that nobody cares about but lets them feel better about themselves. \n\nSo that's basically my view. Only a minuscule number of black people care about Kwanzaa in the slightest, and it's only purpose in society today is to let white people put on a show about how \"diverse\" they are. \n\nEdit...\n\nI'd like to draw a contrast to when my company put up a display honoring Diwali. That was an actual holiday that people actually celebrated, and I did not have the same opinion about it. This isn't just an \"only Christian holidays count\" thing. \n\n\nEdit 2....\n\nEveryone seems to want to convince me that there actually are people who celebrate it, even though they personally have never met anyone. I've already granted that it is not impossible that there are some people who celebrate it, but that really isn't crucial to my view that the Kwanzaa decorations are more for putting on a show than to actually mark the holiday.\n\nAlso, I'm a little surprised that nobody has just come straight out and lied and said that they celebrated it. It would have been really easy and I'm kinda proud of everyone that nobody has done it yet.  \n\nFinal edit....\n\nIt's been a few days, so I'll wrap this one up. Just as a final note, not only did nobody change my view, nobody even attempted to. All everybody wanted to do was nitpick about the number of people who celebrate Kwanzaa.
