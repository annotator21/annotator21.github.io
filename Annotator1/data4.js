Sure, with knowledge of basic numbers, we could theoretically use those numbers to derive all the theorems of geometry and calculus, reinvent fields like engineering, and create whole new mathematical principles simply by thinking about them, because math is a completely human invention. However, this is obviously foolish because countless geniuses have already made those discoveries; it makes much more sense to learn about what's already been discovered, even if (and especially if) you hope to make new discoveries yourself. And to assume that a person who knows very little about math could come up with those theories is, while strictly theoretically true, practically ridiculous.\n\nThe same goes for philosophy. Sure, you COULD use what you know about the world to independently come up with Wittgenstein's *Tractatus*, but I bet you won't, because to do so requires a monumental amount of existing philosophical knowledge that is impossible to figure out in a lifetime without some prior reference. So for the reason alone that it is virtually impossible to reach high levels of philosophy without first understanding the foundations, studying philosophy is a worthwhile endeavor because it gives the student access to knowledge that would have been highly arcane to them had they not studied the subject.\n\nBut your main argument seems to be that studying philosophy is a waste of time because it has no practical use. For one thing, the assumption that the only reason to study something is to major in that field is highly incorrect. Many people including myself leave college and never once use their major in the real world. Some use college as an opportunity to train for professional skills, others see it as a way to grow themselves as people and learn more about the world in general before getting a job and no longer having the opportunity. Both of these are worthwhile notions, and the very fact that people choose to study philosophy as opposed to more \"useful\" majors is proof that its existence is highly desirable at least to the people who are interested in it.\n\nThe biggest takeaway I get from your post is that you did not study philosophy, and you have somewhat of a misunderstanding of what it is. Many people who have never studied the subject believe to learn philosophy is to sit around shooting the shit about hypothetical questions and hackneyed moral quandaries. In actuality, my philosophical education (I minored in it but took as many classes in it as a major) involved tons of rigorous reading and papers, and included topics like AI theory, nature studies, and tort law. The books are extremely dense and, again, built on the backs of thousands of years of preceding philosophy, making it doubly important to study the subject in order to make that more advanced knowledge accessible.\n\nAt the end of the day, even if you don't buy most of those arguments, the fact remains that philosophy is worthwhile because there are people who see the value in taking it to expand their own horizons as well as change the way they view the world. Simply providing new modes of thought and analysis can alter the way you see everything else in the world, and in that sense, philosophy can actually be more transformative and helpful than any other subject."}, {"id": "2rmy6e", "body": "As an independent form of study, philosophy doesn't seem to have any practical applications. What value does philosophy have in the modern age, right now, aside from contemplating things. Is it truly worth it to invest a significant amount of time and money studying this field? \n\nThere do not seem to be any tangible applications or appreciable benefits from studying philosophy aside from personal growth and the expansion of one's intellectual perspective, which I argue can be gained without studying philosophy in a rigorously academic manner.  \n\nI often have read the argument that it is impossible to argue that philosophy is useless without using philosophy, or something along those lines.\n\nI acknowledge this. Yes, I am engaging in the use of philosophy right now, at this very moment. However, this does not provide an argument as to why it would be worthwhile to STUDY philosophy. \n\nWhat do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection? \n\nCertainly, important tools have originated from philosophical study, such as the scientific method, and science could be described as a subset of philosophy itself but that isn't an argument against the lack of tangible benefits to be gained from studying philosophy.\n\nYou don't need to study philosophy to become a capable scientist. You shouldn't need to study philosophy to cultivate a reasonable set of moral principles, or to be thoughtful about the circumstances and situations you encounter in your life. \n\nEDIT: I didn't expect so many answers!

The same, I think, can be said for many people in many different arguments. All of the people you know can probably create good sounding arguments, but put them in a room for 20 minutes with an opposing philosopher and they would likely find out that their argument has been done before and has been thoroughly shown to be bad.\n\nSo yes, anyone can make an argument.

Not quite as polished, perhaps, though some distros are getting there, but better-designed. I think this for more or less the same reason I dislike modern Macbooks: things break, and fixing what goes wrong on a Linux system is usually easier than on a Windows one because the system is better-organized. You don't have to download specialized utilities or open the registry. The fix is usually one command. If you want to install software, Windows has no standardized way of doing so. You might download an installer. You might just download a .exe with no installer. When you want to uninstall it again, you might have to use a special-purpose uninstaller to do so. You might have to manually delete files. When you want to update, it's even less standardized. Some programs have their own updating system, some require complete uninstallation, etc.\n\nJust like being able to replace a HDD by taking out one screw is a good thing, being able to swap desktop environments with three commands is a good thing that I don't even think is possible on either Windows or OS X.\n\nOf course, that's with the more user-friendly distros.

[Yes.](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/Inherited-Intelligence/)\n\nSo, what if, instead of killing off the less-intelligent people (I'm against killing. Of most things.) we just limit offspring?\n\nFor example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.\nLike, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.\n\nSo someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. \nThe total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.\n\nConversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.\n\nThis would eventually make the human race smarter, and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. \n\nI know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do, but I'm just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.\n\nExceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit, or etc. (If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one)\n\nPerhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.\n\nMuch better than \"Kill off those with IQ less than 80\"\n\nI wouldn't mind a smarter human race...\n\nEDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.**\n\nEDIT 2: \"**It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view that you aren't looking to have your view changed. I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect.**\" -nikeson\nI suppose that's true, now....\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

[Yes.](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/Inherited-Intelligence/)\n\nSo, what if, instead of killing off the less-intelligent people (I'm against killing. Of most things.) we just limit offspring?\n\nFor example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.\nLike, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.\n\nSo someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. \nThe total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.\n\nConversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.\n\nThis would eventually make the human race smarter, and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. \n\nI know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do, but I'm just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.\n\nExceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit, or etc. (If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one)\n\nPerhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.\n\nMuch better than \"Kill off those with IQ less than 80\"\n\nI wouldn't mind a smarter human race...\n\nEDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.**\n\nEDIT 2: \"**It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view that you aren't looking to have your view changed. I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect.**\" -nikeson\nI suppose that's true, now....\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Of most things.) we just limit offspring?\n\nFor example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.\nLike, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.\n\nSo someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. \nThe total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.\n\nConversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.\n\nThis would eventually make the human race smarter, and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. \n\nI know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do, but I'm just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.\n\nExceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit, or etc. (If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one)\n\nPerhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.\n\nMuch better than \"Kill off those with IQ less than 80\"\n\nI wouldn't mind a smarter human race...\n\nEDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.**\n\nEDIT 2: \"**It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view that you aren't looking to have your view changed.

Your proposal would not make us smarter. It would leave us with fewer low-IQ persons, meaning the *average* IQ would be higher. However, this would not increase the *total* number of persons with high-IQs, which I find more important for advancing the human race. In fact, your proposal would *decrease* the total number of high-IQ persons, since high-IQ families would have less children and low-IQ families would be less likely to produce outliers with high IQs.\n\nI believe the total number of high-IQ persons is more important for advancing the human race. The human race is not advanced by the average population. The human race is advanced by the inventions and discoveries of the extremely gifted and creative individuals. It's those rare individual geniuses that create advancements. The average guys  in the lower 90% will, for the most part, have no impact (neither beneficial or detrimental) on the advancement of the human race. *What we need is more geniuses*. Or at least more smart people. Your proposal limits the number of geniuses and smart people. Therefore, your proposal decreases, rather than increases, the advancement of the human race.\n\nEven if your argument was morally and logistically sound, it still would be counter-productive to the goal you want to achieve. A \"better\" goal would be to force super high-IQ families to have more children.

But the thing is, there's so many other things that a human needs to survive that artificially selecting for specific traits like you recommend can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Consider dogs. Many of us regard purebred dogs as the healthier kinds of dogs, and mutts as, well, mutts. But in artificially selecting for specific characteristics, many breeds of dogs are gaining a lot of genetic defects. Each breed comes with a list of potential issues, large dogs get bloat, cocker spaniels have brains too big for their skulls, German shepherds get hip dysplasia, don't even get me started on bulldogs. We've artificially selected for appearance and personality (including traits like intelligence) without considering health.\n\nObviously with humans we wouldn't go that far, but the fact of the matter is, we can't reliably breed out genetic disorders, not without trillions of dollars in effort and research. We just don't have the tech or the infrastructure to decode everyone's genome yet. And even if we could, how should we select? Sickle-cell anemia is a terrible thing for a lot of people in first-world countries. But in malaria infested parts of the world, it gives people increased immunity. So, what do we do with that?\n\nSo, in order for your proposal to work, we need a much better guideline. Not just going for \"intelligence\" (a poorly defined trait, but whatever), but health, drive, success in society, and so on. My question is: aren't we already doing that? In an idealized capitalist society, the harder workers, the smarter engineers, the people that are offering more to society get more money, which allows them a greater chance at raising children who can then raise their own children and spread whatever it is that allowed their parents to be successful. And it's working. Just with intelligence alone, the Flynn effect shows that globally, humanity is getting smarter, or at least is achieving better in standardized IQ tests.

The first deals with a few factors of evolution that are typically misunderstood.\n\nEvolution does not select for the *best* examples of a given species, but rather eliminates those who cannot (fail to) survive to adulthood or cannot (fail to) secure a mate. Additionally, sufficiently optimized species typically have a great deal of difficulty surviving transitions in their environment as they are optimized to a given environment (many humans would like to make a transition to being a space-faring species). As such, the support of weaker/less intelligent individuals not only does not exactly sacrifice an optimizing agent we used to enjoy, but also could leave us in an evolutionary cul de sac and much more vulnerable to extinction.\n\nThe other major issue is that the interactions amongst genes and between genes and the environment is not nearly so straightforward as introductory biology classes may leave one with the impression of. For instance, conditions like schizophrenia arise from the combination of a number of different genes and there are several combinations that yield similar symptoms. The other effects of each of these individual genes may be positive in their own right. Additionally, the activation of a given gene is dependent on numerous factors, some of them environmental. This means that we cannot conclusively state that we understand the effects of a given gene, at least not with the current limitations on our knowledge in this area.\n\nWhat we are starting to really gain access to is the ability to replicate the effects of a given gene, to either suppress a negative or induce a positive trait. As-needed gene therapy provides a much more robust gene pool should our society ever be placed in evolutionary bottle-neck conditions (such as a highly lethal pandemic) whilst allowing individuals to still optimize themselves to their own preferences and therefore seems an ultimately better course to pursue."}, {"id": "2rkzen", "body": "Okay, I'm talking about making the human race smarter, forever.\nIntelligence is at least partially genetic and therefore passed down by parents, yes?

So here's my idea.\n\nEach person is allowed one child.  So every married couple can have two kids.  It's not directly attached to the person though, kind of like a ticket to get cashed in.  So you can sell your ticket if you don't want to have children, or want money for ... whatever.  This obviously benefits the wealthy.  It's supposed to because if a person has more resources they are better suited to take care of more children, financially.  It could also become a thing where kids sell away their reproductive rights and travel, or use it to pay for education, only to do the same with their disposable income when they get older, allowing the next generation to have some disposable income when they have the time and energy to use it.\n\nThe second part is education.  If you graduate college, or a trade school (note that these would have to be properly defined with criteria, so that diploma mills aren't equivalent to real universities), but achieving a higher degree of education or a advanced knowledge of a craft provides you with the ability to earn a better living, and therefore have additional children if you so desire.

So obtaining a degree of higher learning would earn you an additional 'ticket'.

A nearly complete overhaul of our culture would have to take place for this to have a positive result.  We'd have to take a 'it takes a village to raise a child' approach and establish a government provided child care service group to establish programming, employee requirements, pay, increase in taxes, oversight, etc.  This would be combined with an overhaul of the education system to create programs that teach kids things, instead of just testing them constantly.  This is pretty much where the idea falls apart, since this would require a 180 degree priority change of our government from military to education.  Since education is almost entirely funded and run by the states right now ... well, we all know what happens when you try to take a right away from the states.\n\nThe third part is a necessity and the final nail in the coffin as to why nothing like this will happen in my lifetime; mandatory birth control.  It would have to be for either all women not currently trying to get pregnant, or everyone.  (It won't work with guys only because of rape and other sexual crimes.  There's already an issue with girls since they all hit puberty at different times, and birth control for a 13 year old might not be good for her, medically)  This is where my idea completely collapses and where I stopped thinking about it.  When does someone get to have their child?  So now the government tells you when you're ready to be a parent?  What happens to the 1% of the times that the birth control doesn't work?  Even if it's less than 1%, birth control isn't perfect, so it's going to happen.  And it gets worse when you try to figure out how to even execute this plan ... we can't reach everyone now-a-days to give away free condoms and clean needles, you want to get these people into a real clinc, to have a real procedure, that the probably don't' even want?

A barrage of other problems arise, to me it proved that until we have a government system that actually works with the people's best interests in mind, this sort of thing would only make things worse.

As doctors tried to figure out what they did to save the girl, they eventually discovered that she had a special mutation that essentially made her immune to rabies - while she was certainly sick, she was one of the very, very few people carrying the right gene that made rabies about as dangerous as the cold.

The hard part is finding and sticking to only that ethical method when doing eugenics. The problem with eugenics in the past is that we simply didn't have the technology to ethically implement it. The problem with your view and with eugenics now is that we don't *quite* have the technology, but we are very close and getting closer every year.\n\nHave you seen the movie [Gattaca](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/)? I think that movie shows an almost perfect implementation of ethical eugenics. You don't need to limit the number of children people have when you can make sure make sure their children will turn out good at the moment of conception. Even stupid people can have smart children with genetic counseling at conception. Make sure everyone gets a free genetic consultation and offer to correct any identifiable genetic diseases and you have ethical eugenics. In Gattaca it wasn't the genetic engineering that made all the 'regular' people live on the streets and have to work as janitors it was people's, humanity's, unfortunate habit of finding someone to discriminate against and then being assholes.\n\nEthical eugenics isn't possible.

The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.\n\nBut far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.\n\nAnd the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.\n\nAdditionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click \"Submit CMV.\" Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.\n\nThanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.\n\nQuick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity. For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed. But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed. This is a real debate: anything else is just convincing a stupid person of something that they fail to understand.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Even if it's about the most insignificant of things, or even if they didn't change their mind at all, it's still a positive step for that person to try.\n\nSecond, it sometimes goes the other way. Just because OP doesn't change his mind doesn't mean someone reading the comments hasn't. I've read several posts where I went in disagreeing with OP, but after reading the arguments in favor of their arguments, I've come out with a different point of view. I had no part in the discussion, no comments were made, no deltas awarded, but someone's view was changed.\n\nMaybe it feels like slogging through shit sometimes, but if you can get someone to think critically about their own beliefs even for a second, isn't that a good thing?"}, {"id": "cngqpe6", "body": "Delta here.

The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.\n\nBut far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.\n\nAnd the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.\n\nAdditionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click \"Submit CMV.\" Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.\n\nThanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.\n\nQuick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity.

But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed.

But the point of Reddit and these subs is to get engage the community, let the knowledgeable ones share their knowledge (and show off a bit, let's be real) and let others learn (especially those who wouldn't have ever thought to be curious about this certain thing in the first place). \n\nSee, I generally go into the more opinion-based threads, both for the challenge and to make up for the fact that there aren't that many topics out there where I can claim to be an expert.

You yourself did the very thing you complain about others doing. \n\nAnd on the whole topic of deltas and stuff, I think objectively we should all agree that they don't matter that much. That what truly matters is we put ourselves out there, shared something we wanted to and moved on. But we're human and we like deltas, upvotes and gold because we like feeling validated and we like it when people agree with us. No point in lying about it; I'll be the first to say that I get a bit giddy every time a post of mine gets a few upvotes and that it upsets me at least a little bit when I get downvoted. It's how it goes. And I know it's only worse when it happens when I'm right. \n\nBut I also think there's more to it than this.

I realize my view is possibly more of an ideal, but places truly looking to educate their students should acknowledge the true reason for prerequisites and search for better alternatives. \n\nI am mainly going to look at prerequisites being enforced at publicly-funded Universities and high-schools, and will share a few real examples I've encountered with friends over the years here:\n\nCase 1: Friend in high school cannot apply to an Architecture program because she lacks Grade 12 Physics (and Grade 11 Physics, which is the prerequisite). It is first semester of twelfth grade for her, but she has two other necessary Math courses conflicting in time with the only 2 offerings of Grade 11 Physics courses at her school. She will now have to take Grade 11 Physics elsewhere on top of her normal schooling (but must still remain a full-time student to apply to the Universities). This will cost her both time and money unnecessarily when she can herself try to learn the material for Grade 11 Physics independently, and if asked, write an exam to take Grade 12 Physics in the second semester, which will actually give her a chance to join the Architecture program (assuming only Grade 12 marks are looked at for admission). Unfortunately, she cannot do this by school guidelines, and now has to take an accelerated Grade 11 and 12 course privately on top of her normal school schedule. \n\nCase 2: Friend wants to take a Cell Biology and Biochemistry course out of pure interest and also because he can use it to complete his degree. He's taken 1st-year Biology, but not 1st-year Chemistry, and can thus not enrol in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is also a prerequisite for Cell Biology, and by not taking 1st-year Chemistry, he cannot enrol in either course. I have taken 1st-year Chemistry, and can attest to how little it was used in these courses. All of the concepts could easily be understood and students could have done well with minimal Chemistry knowledge (and some did). They are both 2nd-year Biochemistry and Cell Biology courses, and all of the Chemistry handled was incredibly basic (high school Chemistry would be more than sufficient) or was already taught in the 1st-year Biology course. In this case, he simply had not the time nor money to enrol in 1st-year Chemistry, and was thus restricted from enrolling in Biochemistry or Cell Biology. Even after requesting special permission and trying to prove his background and asking the profs for the necessary Chemistry background, he was denied. \n\nCase 3: A 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course requires a 2nd-year DE course. I will say that DE is an integral part of the course and for a student lacking this knowledge, they will fall behind and do poorly. I also have a friend whom could not take the 2nd-year DE course with me because he would have to overload and it would be quite costly. Nonetheless, he learned the DE content on his own time when he could over the summer break and weekends. Heck, he probably went over more concepts in DE than we did in our 1 semester class. But, because he did not take this specific course, he cannot take the 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course, thus pushing him back with his coursework. He will be taking the DE course, but only in the future and only because it is a part of the degree requirements. If a student wants to learn something earlier and they are confident in their background, why stop them? \n\nNow special permission can sometimes be obtained for enrolment from the course coordinator, but more often that not (from my experience) this is not the case and only happens in extreme circumstances. In the above cases, my friends all asked for special permission and were denied without even a chance to prove they have a sufficient background to keep up with the class (and possibly excel).  \n\nStudents should be in charge of their own education. If institutions want to (strongly) suggest a few other courses or materials ahead of time or possibly require a passing grade on a entrance test, sure, let them do that to ensure the class goes at an appropriate level. \n\nI also just want to clarify that I believe anti-requisites are very important for courses.\n\nEDIT: A student taking the course should not interfere with the University's right to confer them a degree if they've not completed the appropriate prerequisites for the degree itself. If two courses are necessary for the degree, the student must complete them. No privilege is given for taking the course itself. I am talking about why they cannot simply enrol in the course. That's it. My views are idealistic, but there certainly can be improvements at very little expense.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There are also formal prerequisites on your secondary education for being enrolled into the degree program.\n\nWe don't have a problem with people scores of unqualified students in courses. Consequently it doesn't lower the level of the entire class either. At least not according to student evaluations and the teachers. Anecdotally, I've also taken many coursed and been a TA on a few, and none of them had the problem either.\n\nStudents know they'll get slaughtered if they enroll in a class they're not qualified for. The few people who do anyway just fail.\n\nI've been vicechairman for our study board of mathematics and computer science for about two years. Some of our responsibilites are quality assurance and development of educations as well as defining the degree curriculum for educations within our area that are offered by the university. There is no data to support that we suffer from your hypothetical problems. As vicechairman, I also (along with our chairman) coordinate with the study boards for the other fields under our university's Faculty of Science, and they don't report having those problems either."}, {"id": "cngp4ej", "body": "Pre-requisites provide an objective check on whether or not someone is likely to be adequately prepared for a course, rather than leaving it up to their own (often inflated) judgment of their own ability.\n\nIf left up to students to decide whether they were probably ready for a course, you would end up with scores of underprepared students in courses they couldn't handle, simply because they were trying to speed their way through college (and save money) by cutting as many corners as they could while still getting by.\n\nProfessors are bound to help their students when they don't understand.

I realize my view is possibly more of an ideal, but places truly looking to educate their students should acknowledge the true reason for prerequisites and search for better alternatives. \n\nI am mainly going to look at prerequisites being enforced at publicly-funded Universities and high-schools, and will share a few real examples I've encountered with friends over the years here:\n\nCase 1: Friend in high school cannot apply to an Architecture program because she lacks Grade 12 Physics (and Grade 11 Physics, which is the prerequisite). It is first semester of twelfth grade for her, but she has two other necessary Math courses conflicting in time with the only 2 offerings of Grade 11 Physics courses at her school. She will now have to take Grade 11 Physics elsewhere on top of her normal schooling (but must still remain a full-time student to apply to the Universities). This will cost her both time and money unnecessarily when she can herself try to learn the material for Grade 11 Physics independently, and if asked, write an exam to take Grade 12 Physics in the second semester, which will actually give her a chance to join the Architecture program (assuming only Grade 12 marks are looked at for admission). Unfortunately, she cannot do this by school guidelines, and now has to take an accelerated Grade 11 and 12 course privately on top of her normal school schedule. \n\nCase 2: Friend wants to take a Cell Biology and Biochemistry course out of pure interest and also because he can use it to complete his degree. He's taken 1st-year Biology, but not 1st-year Chemistry, and can thus not enrol in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is also a prerequisite for Cell Biology, and by not taking 1st-year Chemistry, he cannot enrol in either course. I have taken 1st-year Chemistry, and can attest to how little it was used in these courses. All of the concepts could easily be understood and students could have done well with minimal Chemistry knowledge (and some did). They are both 2nd-year Biochemistry and Cell Biology courses, and all of the Chemistry handled was incredibly basic (high school Chemistry would be more than sufficient) or was already taught in the 1st-year Biology course. In this case, he simply had not the time nor money to enrol in 1st-year Chemistry, and was thus restricted from enrolling in Biochemistry or Cell Biology. Even after requesting special permission and trying to prove his background and asking the profs for the necessary Chemistry background, he was denied. \n\nCase 3: A 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course requires a 2nd-year DE course. I will say that DE is an integral part of the course and for a student lacking this knowledge, they will fall behind and do poorly. I also have a friend whom could not take the 2nd-year DE course with me because he would have to overload and it would be quite costly. Nonetheless, he learned the DE content on his own time when he could over the summer break and weekends. Heck, he probably went over more concepts in DE than we did in our 1 semester class. But, because he did not take this specific course, he cannot take the 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course, thus pushing him back with his coursework. He will be taking the DE course, but only in the future and only because it is a part of the degree requirements. If a student wants to learn something earlier and they are confident in their background, why stop them? \n\nNow special permission can sometimes be obtained for enrolment from the course coordinator, but more often that not (from my experience) this is not the case and only happens in extreme circumstances. In the above cases, my friends all asked for special permission and were denied without even a chance to prove they have a sufficient background to keep up with the class (and possibly excel).  \n\nStudents should be in charge of their own education. If institutions want to (strongly) suggest a few other courses or materials ahead of time or possibly require a passing grade on a entrance test, sure, let them do that to ensure the class goes at an appropriate level. \n\nI also just want to clarify that I believe anti-requisites are very important for courses.\n\nEDIT: A student taking the course should not interfere with the University's right to confer them a degree if they've not completed the appropriate prerequisites for the degree itself. If two courses are necessary for the degree, the student must complete them. No privilege is given for taking the course itself. I am talking about why they cannot simply enrol in the course. That's it. My views are idealistic, but there certainly can be improvements at very little expense.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It is first semester of twelfth grade for her, but she has two other necessary Math courses conflicting in time with the only 2 offerings of Grade 11 Physics courses at her school. She will now have to take Grade 11 Physics elsewhere on top of her normal schooling (but must still remain a full-time student to apply to the Universities). This will cost her both time and money unnecessarily when she can herself try to learn the material for Grade 11 Physics independently, and if asked, write an exam to take Grade 12 Physics in the second semester, which will actually give her a chance to join the Architecture program (assuming only Grade 12 marks are looked at for admission). Unfortunately, she cannot do this by school guidelines, and now has to take an accelerated Grade 11 and 12 course privately on top of her normal school schedule. \n\nCase 2: Friend wants to take a Cell Biology and Biochemistry course out of pure interest and also because he can use it to complete his degree. He's taken 1st-year Biology, but not 1st-year Chemistry, and can thus not enrol in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is also a prerequisite for Cell Biology, and by not taking 1st-year Chemistry, he cannot enrol in either course. I have taken 1st-year Chemistry, and can attest to how little it was used in these courses. All of the concepts could easily be understood and students could have done well with minimal Chemistry knowledge (and some did). They are both 2nd-year Biochemistry and Cell Biology courses, and all of the Chemistry handled was incredibly basic (high school Chemistry would be more than sufficient) or was already taught in the 1st-year Biology course. In this case, he simply had not the time nor money to enrol in 1st-year Chemistry, and was thus restricted from enrolling in Biochemistry or Cell Biology. Even after requesting special permission and trying to prove his background and asking the profs for the necessary Chemistry background, he was denied. \n\nCase 3: A 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course requires a 2nd-year DE course. I will say that DE is an integral part of the course and for a student lacking this knowledge, they will fall behind and do poorly. I also have a friend whom could not take the 2nd-year DE course with me because he would have to overload and it would be quite costly. Nonetheless, he learned the DE content on his own time when he could over the summer break and weekends. Heck, he probably went over more concepts in DE than we did in our 1 semester class. But, because he did not take this specific course, he cannot take the 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course, thus pushing him back with his coursework. He will be taking the DE course, but only in the future and only because it is a part of the degree requirements. If a student wants to learn something earlier and they are confident in their background, why stop them? \n\nNow special permission can sometimes be obtained for enrolment from the course coordinator, but more often that not (from my experience) this is not the case and only happens in extreme circumstances. In the above cases, my friends all asked for special permission and were denied without even a chance to prove they have a sufficient background to keep up with the class (and possibly excel).  \n\nStudents should be in charge of their own education.

I realize my view is possibly more of an ideal, but places truly looking to educate their students should acknowledge the true reason for prerequisites and search for better alternatives. \n\nI am mainly going to look at prerequisites being enforced at publicly-funded Universities and high-schools, and will share a few real examples I've encountered with friends over the years here:\n\nCase 1: Friend in high school cannot apply to an Architecture program because she lacks Grade 12 Physics (and Grade 11 Physics, which is the prerequisite). It is first semester of twelfth grade for her, but she has two other necessary Math courses conflicting in time with the only 2 offerings of Grade 11 Physics courses at her school. She will now have to take Grade 11 Physics elsewhere on top of her normal schooling (but must still remain a full-time student to apply to the Universities). This will cost her both time and money unnecessarily when she can herself try to learn the material for Grade 11 Physics independently, and if asked, write an exam to take Grade 12 Physics in the second semester, which will actually give her a chance to join the Architecture program (assuming only Grade 12 marks are looked at for admission). Unfortunately, she cannot do this by school guidelines, and now has to take an accelerated Grade 11 and 12 course privately on top of her normal school schedule. \n\nCase 2: Friend wants to take a Cell Biology and Biochemistry course out of pure interest and also because he can use it to complete his degree. He's taken 1st-year Biology, but not 1st-year Chemistry, and can thus not enrol in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is also a prerequisite for Cell Biology, and by not taking 1st-year Chemistry, he cannot enrol in either course. I have taken 1st-year Chemistry, and can attest to how little it was used in these courses. All of the concepts could easily be understood and students could have done well with minimal Chemistry knowledge (and some did). They are both 2nd-year Biochemistry and Cell Biology courses, and all of the Chemistry handled was incredibly basic (high school Chemistry would be more than sufficient) or was already taught in the 1st-year Biology course. In this case, he simply had not the time nor money to enrol in 1st-year Chemistry, and was thus restricted from enrolling in Biochemistry or Cell Biology. Even after requesting special permission and trying to prove his background and asking the profs for the necessary Chemistry background, he was denied. \n\nCase 3: A 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course requires a 2nd-year DE course. I will say that DE is an integral part of the course and for a student lacking this knowledge, they will fall behind and do poorly. I also have a friend whom could not take the 2nd-year DE course with me because he would have to overload and it would be quite costly. Nonetheless, he learned the DE content on his own time when he could over the summer break and weekends. Heck, he probably went over more concepts in DE than we did in our 1 semester class. But, because he did not take this specific course, he cannot take the 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course, thus pushing him back with his coursework. He will be taking the DE course, but only in the future and only because it is a part of the degree requirements.

Harvard has the right to not confer a degree or to price their tuition however they want. But for an institution that truly wants to educate their students, I would question them not allowing student to at least demonstrate they have the necessary background information to enrol in a course if they haven't simply taken a specific prerequisite, whatever their reason for taking the course may be. "}, {"id": "2rkf8n", "body": "Having gone through schooling for countless years in a variety of disciplines, prerequisites have been more of a hurdle than help. I realize my view is possibly more of an ideal, but places truly looking to educate their students should acknowledge the true reason for prerequisites and search for better alternatives. \n\nI am mainly going to look at prerequisites being enforced at publicly-funded Universities and high-schools, and will share a few real examples I've encountered with friends over the years here:\n\nCase 1: Friend in high school cannot apply to an Architecture program because she lacks Grade 12 Physics (and Grade 11 Physics, which is the prerequisite). It is first semester of twelfth grade for her, but she has two other necessary Math courses conflicting in time with the only 2 offerings of Grade 11 Physics courses at her school. She will now have to take Grade 11 Physics elsewhere on top of her normal schooling (but must still remain a full-time student to apply to the Universities). This will cost her both time and money unnecessarily when she can herself try to learn the material for Grade 11 Physics independently, and if asked, write an exam to take Grade 12 Physics in the second semester, which will actually give her a chance to join the Architecture program (assuming only Grade 12 marks are looked at for admission). Unfortunately, she cannot do this by school guidelines, and now has to take an accelerated Grade 11 and 12 course privately on top of her normal school schedule. \n\nCase 2: Friend wants to take a Cell Biology and Biochemistry course out of pure interest and also because he can use it to complete his degree. He's taken 1st-year Biology, but not 1st-year Chemistry, and can thus not enrol in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is also a prerequisite for Cell Biology, and by not taking 1st-year Chemistry, he cannot enrol in either course. I have taken 1st-year Chemistry, and can attest to how little it was used in these courses. All of the concepts could easily be understood and students could have done well with minimal Chemistry knowledge (and some did). They are both 2nd-year Biochemistry and Cell Biology courses, and all of the Chemistry handled was incredibly basic (high school Chemistry would be more than sufficient) or was already taught in the 1st-year Biology course. In this case, he simply had not the time nor money to enrol in 1st-year Chemistry, and was thus restricted from enrolling in Biochemistry or Cell Biology. Even after requesting special permission and trying to prove his background and asking the profs for the necessary Chemistry background, he was denied. \n\nCase 3: A 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course requires a 2nd-year DE course. I will say that DE is an integral part of the course and for a student lacking this knowledge, they will fall behind and do poorly. I also have a friend whom could not take the 2nd-year DE course with me because he would have to overload and it would be quite costly. Nonetheless, he learned the DE content on his own time when he could over the summer break and weekends. Heck, he probably went over more concepts in DE than we did in our 1 semester class. But, because he did not take this specific course, he cannot take the 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course, thus pushing him back with his coursework. He will be taking the DE course, but only in the future and only because it is a part of the degree requirements. If a student wants to learn something earlier and they are confident in their background, why stop them? \n\nNow special permission can sometimes be obtained for enrolment from the course coordinator, but more often that not (from my experience) this is not the case and only happens in extreme circumstances.
