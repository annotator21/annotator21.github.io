I agree that some \"buy american\" mantras have a nationalist slant, but I'm much less concerned with a false allegiance with other Americans than I am with the devastating costs of a globalized economy. I, and my fellow Americans and most Europeans, actually fare quite well in a global economy--I can get products cheaply and I have the buying power to spend internationally. Most of the people you imagine \"helping\" cannot do that.\n\nGlobalized products are far more likely to come across the world. Shipping goods far across the world has disastrous effects on our planet. I will gloss over this, though, because I think this is one of the more obvious answers. Instead, I'll talk a little bit about how a global economy--at least the one we have know--requires extreme income disparity.\n\nMost products that people buy in the US from abroad come from countries that are primarily extractive economies. What this means is essentially that most people in those places make their money making or growing things for other people somewhere else; their work mostly does not go back into the local community. The origins of these sorts of economies is in colonialsm--European countries taking over parts of North and South America, Africa, and Asia in order to take their resources and use their people for cheap (or slave) labor. US companies currently move their operations abroad so that they can pay people less. If you are born in the US, your labor is worth one price, and if you are born in Tunisia, your labor is worth another, much lower price. For the same work. This problem is created by the worldwide trade agreements that essentially allow money, companies, and products to cross country boarders, but make it much harder for people to do so. So a Tunisian workers' labor is only worth less because they cannot easily move to Europe or North America where their labor would be worth more, and the companies can get away with paying them less because they can easily move into new places and pay slightly higher wages than the current local economy can pay. So rather than the local people working to improve their local economy, they instead put most of their efforts into working wage-static jobs for international companies.

I agree that some \"buy american\" mantras have a nationalist slant, but I'm much less concerned with a false allegiance with other Americans than I am with the devastating costs of a globalized economy. I, and my fellow Americans and most Europeans, actually fare quite well in a global economy--I can get products cheaply and I have the buying power to spend internationally. Most of the people you imagine \"helping\" cannot do that.\n\nGlobalized products are far more likely to come across the world. Shipping goods far across the world has disastrous effects on our planet. I will gloss over this, though, because I think this is one of the more obvious answers. Instead, I'll talk a little bit about how a global economy--at least the one we have know--requires extreme income disparity.\n\nMost products that people buy in the US from abroad come from countries that are primarily extractive economies. What this means is essentially that most people in those places make their money making or growing things for other people somewhere else; their work mostly does not go back into the local community. The origins of these sorts of economies is in colonialsm--European countries taking over parts of North and South America, Africa, and Asia in order to take their resources and use their people for cheap (or slave) labor. US companies currently move their operations abroad so that they can pay people less. If you are born in the US, your labor is worth one price, and if you are born in Tunisia, your labor is worth another, much lower price. For the same work. This problem is created by the worldwide trade agreements that essentially allow money, companies, and products to cross country boarders, but make it much harder for people to do so. So a Tunisian workers' labor is only worth less because they cannot easily move to Europe or North America where their labor would be worth more, and the companies can get away with paying them less because they can easily move into new places and pay slightly higher wages than the current local economy can pay.

This applies perfectly to copyright because copying digital data is *genuinely* inexhaustible and the law creates an artificial scarcity.\n\nIt does not quite apply to internet access because it is not genuinely inexhaustible: the upstream ISP has to provide all the equipment and electricity to transmit all your data, which is an *actual* cost that is reasonable to charge you for; however, in the sense that I think you probably meant it, it *is* inexhaustible (you don\u2019t run out of data allowance just because someone else used it, and you\u2019re already paying for the bandwidth anyway) and therefore the above applies.

Rising temperatures means that ice caps melt and much of the ice that was keeping the pressure of the earth just right are evaporating. This causes earthquakes. The reverse isn't true. You don't get more movement in the crust of the earth from an increase of pressure. The only threat that falling temperatures bring, to my knowledge, are lower biodiversity if it gets too bad.

Since most believers in free will would say that someone's thoughts are freely willed in the candy bar example, the argument is that the normal 'folk' definition of free will (basically libertarian free will) doesn't actually require the ability to think otherwise, and that therefore a compatibilist definition of free will shouldn't require this either.\n\nI would say this actually just reveals a major inconsistency in the application of the folk concept of free will, and that even believers in free will couldn't call these decisions freely willed if they gave them some thought. For most actions, most believers in free will would say whether someone could do otherwise is a requirement; the candy bar scenario simply goads believers into adopting another standpoint, i.e. that merely the phenomenological feeling of free will is sufficient to say some thought is freely willed. But ordinarily, this wouldn't be sufficient for *most* believers, and it's simply not their normal criteria. Frankfurt has simply found cases where people are inclined to flip-flop about their criteria for free will.\n\nRegardless, even if Frankfurt is correct about free will not requiring the ability to think otherwise, it certainly does require thoughts to be free (uninfluenced by anything) and willed (influenced by certain aspects of a person's personality). A thought can't be both influenced by some aspect of the will, and also uninfluenced by anything, so the normal conception of free will is incoherent.

But yes, there are many scientific papers that strive to explain the emergent properties of neural networks, I do not claim to understand all the science behind it.  A simple analogy for what I am getting at follows. Imagine a single baseball player on an empty field. Alone, he can throw the ball up and down and that's about it. When a second player joins they can throw the ball to each other, but again that's about it. Once two whole teams arrive, the game of baseball can emerge from the collective. This is something that wouldn't have existed without the collection of 18 players together, as well as the field, lines in the sand, and other systemic attributes. The outcomes of the game are limited by the rules, the field, and the player's individual abilities, but within those limits there are still infinite possible outcomes that could occur. From a complex interaction of many simple parts (players, field, lines, rules, ball, bats, etc), new properties emerge (baseball). Relating this to the brain, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, sensory input, motor output, hormones, cytokines, yada yada yada, all make up the complex biological network that is our central nervous system. From this complexity emerges certain abilities, such as memory, plasticity, temporal projection, empathy, etc. From these emerge consciousness and the ability to choose.
