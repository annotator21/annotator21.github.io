The act of having sex versus not having sex is a choice 100% of the time unless coercion or rape is involved.\n\nOP of that comment said **prepubescent** children are not ready to make the choice to have sex. He's not wrong. The definition of prepubescent is that they are literally not capable of having sex and making that choice. \n\nExample: Prepubescent Jimmy runs over to Sally and pulls his very little dong out to try and have sex with her. He can't. He's prepubescent. That's not a choice he can make.\n\nExample2: You don't have arms. You lost them in a war. You walk over to the TV remote to pick it up. You can't. You're armless. That's not a choice you can make.\n\n[Jesus, people like you are why we can't have nice conversations.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3h6es6zh1c)\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cnae4bs", "body": "So, instead of actually discussing any of my points--and instead taking it into a discussion of you and your wifes bedroom activities for some odd reason--you decide to simply be condescending.

Most of the countries prohibit polygamy, but some allow it. These evolutionary changes or cultural differences, however, all exist within the spectrum of heterosexual union, not same sex.\n\nThere is no consensus on same-sex parenting that is why I am cautious. You may have read the recent quite widespread [report](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/07/children-of-same-sex-couples-are-happier-and-healthier-than-peers-research-shows/) claiming the children of same sex couples are happier and healthier - but make sure to read the [methodology](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/635/abstract) as well. In short, it's a flawed research, because of 390 same sex couples, only 315 provided the data. 75 couples (20%) didn't complete the survey and it's quite obvious that if your child has certain problems or is not doing well, you are less likely to talk about it. Parents often magnify the good deeds of their children, too. In addition most of this kind of researches analyse only childhood and ignore possible adulthood consequences. \n\nAlso, same-sex relationships are [less stable](http://papers.ccpr.ucla.edu/papers/PWP-CCPR-2010-013/PWP-CCPR-2010-013.pdf) (page 33) which definitely does not serve the child well. It *may* be caused by same-sex marriages not being universally allowed, but as well *may not*, it cannot been explicitly confirmed nor denied.

Although very catchy, widespread and quite successful as you must agree, the claim that homosexuals are discriminated by the Western law is technically incorrect.

You weren't really specific about it in your post but how are you planing to implement this? Forcing Disney to add gay couples to their movies? That would most likely result in more protest and hostility against LGBTQ than help it. I think society and acceptance for LGBTQ should change first and this will be reflected in movies automatically then. In fact this is already happening. Remember when e.g. Brokeback mountain was considered to be a scandalous movie? That was in 2005, not even 10 years and now it's almost cool to have a gay person in every movie / TV show. Same with gay marriage in the US. Considering the positive trend in the US / Europe, pushing something that is already happening is rather counterproductive. And don't forget that people can also 'get tired' of LGBTQ demands, especially when the public starts to feel that the LGBTQ community is already accepted. A similar thing happened with women's rights: A lot of people that generally support women's right are becoming hostile towards feminism because they think that we reached the point where feminist are rather asking for extra rights then equal rights (e.g. quotas for women on executive boards). Or I had situations where a coworker at a new job would tell me that he's gay on the first day. I don't mind that he's gay but I found it a bit confusing he would inform me about his sexual preferences considering that people should not be judged by their sexuality and it has nothing to do with work.

I have to accept the fact that a plastic vagina somehow defines a man as a woman, but as I continue my research I begin to believe otherwise because beyond the penis, there is a whole world of hormonal science that comes in to play as well.\n\nTransgender is a bad way of placating people who like to dress otherwise to their actual gender because they FEEL that way, but aren't entirely, or ever will be, that way. \n\nLet the gay people be all over TV, let them have their rights, but stop placating the anti-labeling by transvestites which ironically is a labeling. They don't want to be defined by their genitalia, they want to be defined by the way they dress and act, and it just doesn't work that way in any biological sense when it comes to having sex, using the bathroom, or growing bones and muscle."}, {"id": "cnaii9f", "body": "Science and medicine say that you're wrong.

That's my prerogative, but I am not going to force that on society as a whole since we live in an agnostic culture.\n\nIf there is any legitimate reason for a production company to refrain from having same-sex couples on children's television, it would be because the market demand is limited. I just don't think it is that limited, though. I think children's shows with same-sex couples could be profitable, so we will likely see more in the future and that's fine. It's just business.\n\nHowever, if you are advocating for some sort of legislative action that *legally requires* representation of same-sex couples on children's entertainment, I have to disagree with that. Someone in my position would be left with very limited options for children's entertainment due to my religious beliefs and that isn't fair to me if the market would have chosen otherwise on its own. I have no problem with the natural force of market demand (even if it were to exclusively produce entertainment starring same-sex couples) because it would simply be a reflection of actual societal values, but I don't think it is respectful of my beliefs to only give me the option of showing my children the image of \"normal same-sex relationships\" when content could otherwise be produced that fit my religious beliefs."}, {"id": "2qwnc1", "body": "Let me start this off by saying that I'm gay and 18 years old.

Nothing I say was meant to denigrate or offend anyone and if it does I sincerely apologize.) \n\nI used to work at a retail store with a policy to not discriminate against mentally handicapped individuals when it comes to hiring. I find such a policy to be a generally good thing and definitely helpful in enriching the lives of less fortunate people. But to help elucidate my issue let me tell you about the two employees I worked with. \n\nChanging names obviously, so let's call them Ricky and Julian. I never asked specifically about their illnesses so all I can report on are my observations. \n\nJulian was a much older man, probably 50+ and he seemed to function about as well as a nine or ten year old. He was a sweet man who loved interacting with the customers, tried his hardest, and was nice to everyone. I liked Julian and didn't mind helping him out when he was having a tough time, for example he needed help working the time clock because he couldn't read very well. If Julian was the only handicapped person I ever worked with, my opinion would be different. \n\nThe problem was Ricky. He was a little younger and seemed to be a bit more higher functioning. I'm not sure how to quantify the difference between these guys, but with Julian you felt like you were talking to someone who wasn't all there, while Ricky felt like he was all there, just slow? \n\nAnyway this guy was just a jerk. I feel bad for thinking that because I'm sure his life is filled with many more challenges than mine, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. He didn't try hard to do his job, he didn't stay focused on tasks, and would flatly refuse to do anything he didn't want to do. I saw him many times frustrate the front side supervisors because he would literally wander around the store hiding when he didn't want to work. He wasn't incapable, he could do it and do it well when he wanted. He was just an insensitive contrarian. \n\nThat kind of behavior from a neurotypical employee resulted in termination. I watched coworkers get fired for less, but it seemed like no matter what he did it was impossible to fire Ricky without seeming discriminatory, and I think that's wrong. \n\nJulian worked his hardest and happily completed his tasks, I have absolutely no problem working with him. \nRicky acted like a petulant child and actively made other people's job harder, but we were stuck with him because we either couldn't or wouldn't fire him for underperforming and blatantly disobeying.\n\n"}, {"id": "cna72rc", "body": "I don't know what the arrangement is in your country, but in some countries the goverenment pays the employers to employ mentally disabled people, so it's not costing your employers anything to give Ricky a ''job'' whether he actually does any work or not ... it's just somewhere for him to go each day so that he might be able to do something other than sit at home and claim welfare benefits directly.\n\n If he didn't have this ''job'' that's what he would be doing, so maybe he does a little bit of work sometimes which is useful, and maybe he is less bored than he would be at home, so it benefits everyone.\n\nMaybe he is not held to the same standard as regular employees because the company isn't paying him like they are paying you ...?"}, {"id": "cna72rc", "body": "I don't know what the arrangement is in your country, but in some countries the goverenment pays the employers to employ mentally disabled people, so it's not costing your employers anything to give Ricky a ''job'' whether he actually does any work or not ... it's just somewhere for him to go each day so that he might be able to do something other than sit at home and claim welfare benefits directly.\n\n If he didn't have this ''job'' that's what he would be doing, so maybe he does a little bit of work sometimes which is useful, and maybe he is less bored than he would be at home, so it benefits everyone.\n\nMaybe he is not held to the same standard as regular employees because the company isn't paying him like they are paying you ...?"}]}
