It is a discriminatory crutch for a hiring process which is fundamentally incapable of determining merit. That does not make it fair or necessary - we should seek to fix the hiring process, instead.  \n\n&gt;References &amp; letters of recommendation play the same role in hiring as networking.  \n\nThere is some level of preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities if an applicant manages to name-drop a family friend or some other networked contact in an interview, but references only come into play far down the flowchart in a normal hiring process, after some screening for merit has already been performed (checking qualifications, education, etc.). Networking is capable of dropping an applicant onto the short list from the get-go, basically giving them a leg up out of the gate before anyone has looked at their resume. It's more of a problem, IMO.  \n\n&gt;Egalitarian hiring practices are a slippery slope.  \n\nI'm suggesting going after low-hanging fruit. There are many alternatives to networking in establishing a potential hire's qualifications &amp; capability - it's simply not necessary. (Aside: I have other ideas about \"sanitizing\" an applicant pool to prevent problems with cultural bias vs. women or minorities in order to ensure more fair hiring practices, but that's a different can of worms.)  \n\n&gt;Every component on a resume favors those who come from an advantaged background.  \n\nI must concede this on some level (see 2.2.1). With enough money, even meritorious degrees with rigorous testing (e.g. law degrees from prestigious institutions) become suspect, &amp; it's much easier for someone who's white, rich, etc. to manage impressive qualifications anywhere on a resume.  \n\nHowever, I feel the balance of these qualifications to lean towards merit much moreso than networking. Yes, an appropriate degree from a prestigious institution could either indicate intelligence, theoretical competence &amp; work ethic...or the size of daddy's pocketbook. Yes, I have known individuals who didn't do college who have more relevant skill &amp; experience than anyone I've met. However, I haven't yet met someone with a degree in a particular field who was not competent in that field.  \n\nOn the other hand, I have met a few people whose claim to competence was to know someone important, individuals I wouldn't trust to tie my shoes. The evidence is anecdotal, but compelling.  \n\n&gt;Social skills are necessary for employees, networking is an indicator of those skills.  \n\nSure, but it's more an indicator of *who* you're friends with. Nobody cares if you've networked with a janitor, regardless of how hard it is to be friends with him.  \n\n&gt;Networking is a way to get the word out about jobs which are otherwise invisible to applicants.  \n\nIn the age of indeed? I don't buy it.  \n\n&gt;You have not posited a replacement for the current hiring system.  \n\nThat's a different thing than establishing that networking as a business practice is ludicrously biased &amp; not in the best interest of either companies or society. If it *is* necessary, it is a necessary evil, &amp; should be regarded as such.  \n\nThat being said, I know &amp; have applied to several companies which use anonymous competency tests for every applicant &amp; require a certain score before anyone sees your resume. That seems a step in the right direction."}, {"id": "cn8bcoe", "body": "&gt;  a hiring process which is fundamentally incapable of determining merit. \n\nI think you are hitting the nail on the head as to why networking is both useful and necessary. But what you are missing is that this will never change significantly. \n\nThere are two options for a hiring process: (a) the process is entirely automated and uses only objectively verifiable criteria and objectively verifiable observations of the prospective employee, or (b) the process is subjective at one or more point in the process.\n\nThe field of Industrial/Organizational Psychology includes, among other things, research on how to effectively use objective test results from prospective hires to aide in choosing the best candidates for positions. But, and here's the rub, the best tests we have only give us marginal indicators of who will be successful in any given position. And while the use of such tests increases the success rate of hiring processes, they can not possibly account for every variable in a given position and subjective assessment is still necessarily part of the best processes. No test or combination of tests will guarantee a successful hire. Moreover, no test or combination of tests will ever remove the human relationship element from business -- and since managers need to have relationships with their employees to be successful, managers need to have subjective criteria as part of the hiring process. \n\nFurther, you seem to believe that when a person is being hired for a position, that the position is always well delineated and easily defined. That is not the case in reality. I've personally been in a position where I was a shoe-in for a job in part because of networking connections, and after talking to the person doing the hiring they pulled the job offer because of their respect for me and my views. I asked a question about their business process during the interview and the result of our conversation was that they realized the job they needed filled wasn't the job they had advertised.\n\nNetworking is useful for the person doing the hiring as well as the person being hired. By having well-qualified known prospects in the interview stream, the hiring individual can have a better basis on which to build their subjective criteria for the position's requirements and their subjective criteria for candidate evaluation. This doesn't always result in the candidate who is being interviewed due to network connections getting the job.\n\nFurther, in any company of any significant size,  networking doesn't do anything other than alert someone that a position is available. They will still need to get through the HR screening to reach the interview stages. However, something I observe is that people who are very good at networking are also generally very good at understanding the HR processes and know how to write a resume and cover letter that targets their intended audience. It is very rare for me to find someone who is a strong networker who has a bad resume or who doesn't write a specific, targeted quality cover letter.  \n\nI think the reason for this is obvious -- people who are good at business relationships are probably good at other social aspects of business as well, and that includes communication skills relevant to crafting quality applications. \n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "2qia6o", "body": "'1.

"}, {"id": "cn6pf4m", "body": "You seem to view networking as some incestuous archaic system of perpetuating discrimination. While this can certainly be true, it can also be a great tool for companies that lack robust resources to use in the hiring process. \n\nThere is no uniform hiring process across all companies. Some do it much better than others. For example, a large corporation like Procter &amp; gamble that has been around for over a century knows exactly what it wants in a candidate and has long standing processes for finding out the information they deem important for the particular position. Some kid that gets their resume passed along to someone in the company really does NOT have much of a leg up if he or she doesn't possess those qualities. P&amp;G knows it would be bad for their company to choose that person over a candidate who does have the desired qualifications and skills, and that the better candidate will likely go to a rival otherwise. \n\nOn the other hand, a smaller or newer company does not have the experience or resources of a Procter &amp; Gamble. Hiring people is very expensive, even more so if you pick the wrong candidate. Most companies simply aren't able to learn all they want or need about a candidate in a \"typical\" hiring process. Is the person being entirely truthful? Do they have some demons that wouldn't come up in a normal process? Alcoholic or drug addict? People are incredibly complicated and unique, and a resume and a few interviews is just not enough to truly learn very much. But when your longtime friend or colleague, who you trust and has a proven track record, puts their name behind someone that will carry a lot of weight in your mind. They're saying \"I know some more background about this person, I think they can fit well with this job and company, and you would be wise to give them consideration.\" They are putting their own reputation at risk, and if they recommend some dipshit that looks bad on them. It's not just about rubbing elbows to \"smarm your way into having him drop your resume on top of the pile\". Does this happen? Absolutely. But good companies know the difference between an earnest recommendation and someone who just had their name moved to the top for no reason other than he did shots with the head of marketing at that event last fall. \n\nNetworking comes down to learning more about someone outside of just going down a checklist.

"}, {"id": "cn6pf4m", "body": "You seem to view networking as some incestuous archaic system of perpetuating discrimination. While this can certainly be true, it can also be a great tool for companies that lack robust resources to use in the hiring process. \n\nThere is no uniform hiring process across all companies. Some do it much better than others. For example, a large corporation like Procter &amp; gamble that has been around for over a century knows exactly what it wants in a candidate and has long standing processes for finding out the information they deem important for the particular position. Some kid that gets their resume passed along to someone in the company really does NOT have much of a leg up if he or she doesn't possess those qualities. P&amp;G knows it would be bad for their company to choose that person over a candidate who does have the desired qualifications and skills, and that the better candidate will likely go to a rival otherwise. \n\nOn the other hand, a smaller or newer company does not have the experience or resources of a Procter &amp; Gamble. Hiring people is very expensive, even more so if you pick the wrong candidate. Most companies simply aren't able to learn all they want or need about a candidate in a \"typical\" hiring process. Is the person being entirely truthful? Do they have some demons that wouldn't come up in a normal process? Alcoholic or drug addict? People are incredibly complicated and unique, and a resume and a few interviews is just not enough to truly learn very much. But when your longtime friend or colleague, who you trust and has a proven track record, puts their name behind someone that will carry a lot of weight in your mind. They're saying \"I know some more background about this person, I think they can fit well with this job and company, and you would be wise to give them consideration.\" They are putting their own reputation at risk, and if they recommend some dipshit that looks bad on them. It's not just about rubbing elbows to \"smarm your way into having him drop your resume on top of the pile\". Does this happen? Absolutely. But good companies know the difference between an earnest recommendation and someone who just had their name moved to the top for no reason other than he did shots with the head of marketing at that event last fall. \n\nNetworking comes down to learning more about someone outside of just going down a checklist. If you have repeatedly met someone at industry events it shows they are making the extra effort to show up and learn. If your friend recommends the girl he used to play basketball with it shows she knows a bit about her sportsmanship and competitiveness in a non work environment. \n\nAny company that recommends someone based on who their daddy is is probably not a company you want to work for anyways, as it shows they lack common business sense.

Being able to put a face and a personality onto a resume matters when you're hiring people.  You want to hire people that are going to work out.  If 3 people from the department all vouch for a particular candidate as being ideal for the job, why should the stranger get it instead?\n\n\n\n&gt; '1.2.

Depends on the business and the work environment too.  Knowing that a person is well regarded, or liked, by existing employees can help make the hiring transition easier.  Again, the known quantity is highly desirable during the hiring process.  Knowing that there will be less conflicts due to familiarity IS a tangible, quantifiable factor.\n\n&gt; '1.3. Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process (\"jumping the line\") or to use some important person's recommendation as additional clout for their application (\"came very highly recommended by Bob\") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities.\n\nBob's recommendation is not irrelevant.  You know Bob, you know Bob's standards.  Bob's opinion is not irrelevant in this case.\n\nNetworking is about establishing your person, not just your credentials.  Just being qualified for the technical duties of a job does not mean you are going to be a good fit for the company or it's culture.  If you get hired, and then quit within a month because it turns out you just clash with everybody there, that's a bad business decision that costs money.\n\nNetworking saves the employer, and the employee, from situations like that.  If you can get people to vouch for your person, especially within the company, you are proving your aptitude for the position.\n\nAnybody can put \"Nice guy, works well with others.\" on their resume, doesn't mean they aren't, but they might not be nice according others, they may not work well with my company's particular others.

If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications/character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.\n\nNot really.

For an employer, having a known quantity is more valuable than an unknown quantity.

A \"standard\" hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position &amp; merits relevant to that position.  \n\n'1.2. Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions (e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant.  \n\n'1.3. Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process (\"jumping the line\") or to use some important person's recommendation as additional clout for their application (\"came very highly recommended by Bob\") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities.  \n\n'1.3.1. I recognize &amp; appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc. This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier.  \n\n'2. Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria.  \n\n'2.1. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families &amp; backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.  \n\n'2.2. Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region/social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage.  \n\n'2.2.1. I understand that there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have (being tall, white, male, etc.). Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias &amp; may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair - that is what I am suggesting.  \n\n'3.

I would love to have this explained in a way that takes the above points into account &amp; would allow a person to network without the valuation that it is a necessary evil.  \n\nEDIT: I'd like to reiterate something, because it keeps cropping up in the comments: *yes, networking is a useful crutch in hiring because most hiring processes are fundamentally broken, but that does not make it fair, just, or desirable.*\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Look at Penny and Oppo, they are forced to run a show that pokes fun at their stature, and they are the lucky ones; most children are left to die in the woods. Having a dwarf in the family is seen as an insult to the family, and Tywin cares deeply about the family image.\n\n#\n*Tyrion frequents brothels, has married a whore and drinks a lot. Tywin is a hard man, and is known to disapprove of whores and those who frequent them. He is said to waste the family gold on drinking and whoring and Tyrin has said he will not let Tyrion turn Casterly Rock into his whorehouse.\n\nAs for Jamie and Cersei, I think they were only caught once, and forbidden from fucking each other again, so they kept it very secret or stopped.\n \nWhen it comes to Jaime and him having Casterly Rock, Tywin thinks he can break the rules, and it can be done. When it comes to the Kingsguard, they have dismissed a member (despite the order being for life) and they have appointed someone who is not a knight (Sandor Clegane - despite all previous members being knights), so what is the new practice of awarding lands? Kingsguard forsake lands and titles when they join, but they can be granted titles while serving, so it is not a large jump to receive lands too. Tywin is obsessed with Jamie receiving Casterly Rock because of his hatred for Tyrion.\n\n3)\n\nWinning the war. As you said, he ultimately wins the war. That's all really. The ends justify the means, some would say. The North won't be happy, the Starks are dead or gone and they loved the Starks. But there is control in the form of Roose Bolton. And the North can try to reject rule, but most of the North is full of Lannister and Bolton loyalists, with only White Harbor and the Last Hearth poised to make any kind of weak attempt at comeback.\n\nAs for winning in unconventional ways, the pen is mightier than the sword and all that and not all wars are won by battles.\n\n\nIn the end, Tywin does live up to his reputation. A master strategist, a cunning politician and an unforgiving man. Arguably he was very successful, his daughter was Queen, his elder son was Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, his grandsons were King, he is the richest man in Westeros and he is the Hand of the King, the second most powerful man in Westeros.

This year alone, there's been multiple \"kids\" movies that deal very frankly with the idea of death. How to Train Your Dragon 2 and Big Hero 6 are just two huge non-Pixar examples. \n\n\"Out of favor\" is very arguable when two of the current biggest animated films deal with the explicit deaths of loved ones and show funeral scenes and the long-term grieving process (especially Big Hero 6. That movie's theme of grief and its effect on others was pretty painful to witness, especially as an adult). \n\nEven last year, Frozen became the biggest animated film of all time, and dealt very frankly with the death of parents and a near-public-execution; plus, if you want to go deeper and less explicit, mental health and isolation. \n\nAlso, yeah, Adventure Time isn't a good example when it arguably has grown very dark and violent over the past few seasons. See: any of the stuff relating to the Lich or the Ice King or the origin of Ooo (the show's setting). Just because current films and TV shows aimed at kids don't really advertise their maturity or dark elements like in years past doesn't mean that they don't exist.

Firstly, I don't believe people can be summed up by a series of letters, as if that's all there is to them. People are complex and have various characteristics, which change in their degree or intensity depending on who they're interacting with or what they're doing; these characteristics can be changed by willpower or reform, or trauma or other external influences. I don't agree with Dr. House that people are immune to change.\n\nThe second reason I distrust personality tests is because other people treat them like horoscopes. A group of friends were discussing their Myers-Briggs results, and they were saying things like \"I thought I was like this, but apparently...\" or \"I wanted to do this, but it looks like I'll never do it because of this result.\"\n\nIn other words, some people seem to let their personality tests dictate their lives. Admittedly, this is a more of a Problem Exists Between Chair and Keyboard than something inherent to, say, Myers-Briggs, but it worries me a great deal that personality tests can inspire an attitude akin to \"Yeah sorry I punched you earlier I'm an Aquarius and my horoscope says We get angry easily so I just couldn't help myself.\" In other words, they seem to inspire a certain level of fatalistic self-resignation; once you've got your personality result, that's who you are and there's not really much you can do to change that.\n\nThe reason I'm posting the CMV is because my view is probably not too well-informed, I've only taken the Myers-Briggs once (grudgingly, at my brother's behest (and forgotten my result,)) and I haven't really studied the questions or the results.

But they are often used by laypeople who misuse the test and misinterpret the results.\n\nThis problem applies to almost every medical tests as well. Take BMI, for example. You just plug your height and weight into a simple equation, and it will tell you if you are within a healthy range. Seems simple right?\n\nThe problem is that the test doesn't differentiate between being 200 pounds of flab vs. 200 pounds of sheer muscle. It also doesn't differentiate between people who store dangerous visceral fat and less dangerous subcutaneous fat. Lastly, it doesn't change very much even if people start to make much healthier lifestyle choice. These problems make people think they are healthier than they are, and makes other people feel like the hard work they are doing isn't paying off.\n\nThe twist is that BMI was never meant to be used by individuals. It was only meant to be used by public health researchers to measure entire populations. Personality tests are the same. They aren't meant to be horoscopes for individuals. They are useful for researchers studying large groups, and for clinicians looking to get some basic information on patients. They aren't as useful for people who want to learn about their own personalities.\n\nOn the flip side though, sometimes the test does help people to both consider their own biases and to reflect on how they relate to others. Someone who is more extroverted might start to consider that some people are more introverted instead of assuming that they are just mean or anti-social.

The idea is to mainly focus on utilizing your strengths as opposed to fixing your weaknesses. This is an EXCELLENT tool for long-term groups/employers/projects because you can adjust people's workload and focus to match with their strengths. \n\nLastly, some people list their strengths on their resume.

So, please critique :)."}, {"id": "cn6rt0o", "body": "There are many types of personality tests.  You have hit upon a very large field of research called personality psychology.  Myers-Briggs is just one of many tests that measure many different facets of personality and propose their own theories about what the most fundamental traits are innate to an individual and what traits are flexible.  I can't stress enough how big of a topic you are touching upon.  I can't get in to all of it, but I can give you an example of a personality dimension that is generally agreed upon as a real \"trait\" between different personality theories is introversion-extroversion dimension of personality.\n\nYou would probably say that this trait can fluctuate and is based upon situational factors.  You may say that you feel extroverted sometimes, and introverted at others, but this is an inaccurate usage of the terms.  Extroversion and Introversion, by definition are not transient states.  You don't feel extroverted/introverted, you are an extrovert/introvert.  \n\nExtroversion and introversion have various definitions between different personality theories, however they all kind of boil down to extroverts gaining energy from being around others, while introverts gain energy by being by themselves.  \n\nOne of the possible biological  basis for the personality trait of Introversion-Extroversion is Hans Eysenck's theory of arousal.  The theory proposes that the brains of extroverts exist at a lower arousal state by default, in order to perform at their optimal level, they seek out situations that raises their arousal level.  Introverts on the other hand have a higher baseline arousal state.  In order for them to perform at their optimal level they must be in low stimuli environments that do not raise their arousal level.\n\nThere is another theory based on dopamine and reward sensitivity that states that extroverts are more sensitive to dopamine associated with the anticipation of possible reward.  To extroverts, reward cues associated with social interaction are simply more salient (attention getting) and tempting than it is for introverts.  \n\nTry checking out other trait theories of personality.  They all kind of hit upon different aspects and there is not really a definitive answer to which is correct if any at all.\n\n\n-[Big 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) \n\n-[16 personality factor questionnaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16PF_Questionnaire) \n\n-[HEXACO model of personality structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEXACO_model_of_personality_structure)\n\nYou may not agree with any trait theories.  If you believe that our behavior is strictly situationally based then you may prefer [behaviorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) \n\nOr maybe you think it based on our upbringing.  Check out some of the Social cognitive theories  of personality which generally state that personality is based in an individuals interaction with environment as the grow up.\n\nMy guess is you're someone who would probably agree more with [Abraham Maslow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow#Humanistic_psychology) and [Carl Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers) in their emphasis on an individuals own participation and agency in their development.

The email also reads 'And, no, we didn't just send this email to everyone on OkCupid. Go ask an ugly friend and see'.\n\nFirst off, I personally believe attractiveness is subjective-different people prefer different things. Some might think curly hair is ugly, some may think its pretty. Some may think tatoos are sexy, some may think they look stupid. Some may prefer blonde hair, some may prefer black hair. These things, while people may share different opinions, should still not make too big of a difference due to things averaging out.\n\nHowever, other things may not average out so well. For example, females with a flat chest/smaller body(for lack of a better term) are considered unattractive by most men. However, there are some men who find this physical feature quite attractive. But because this is likely a minority opinion, women with this physical characteristic may receive low ratings, and as a result, not show up in results to attractive men with this particular preference. There are plenty of factors in which a minority of people may find attractive, whereas most would find unattractive. Point being, I feel like beauty is, to a degree, subjective, and simply matching the people that are voted most attractive isn't the best way to ensure lasting relationships.\n\nSecondly, setting the threshold to 50% means that it will result in poor self esteem for for those that don't receive it. If you don't receive the message, it implies you're in the bottom 50%, thus 'below average', and therefore ugly. The message also seems to take a rather ill-mannered tone. The lack of receiving this message can result in greater depression. I'm not saying that people shouldn't own up to accept the bad things about them, and deal with their problems, but I don't think OKCupid needs to run their system in a way that reminds everyone of it. Changing the threshhold to something like 80% or 90% would result in positive reinforcement for those who receive it, without it being too negative if you don't receive it.\n\nLastly, it creates a narrow way of searching for a \"compatible\" SO.

The email also reads 'And, no, we didn't just send this email to everyone on OkCupid.

Some might think curly hair is ugly, some may think its pretty. Some may think tatoos are sexy, some may think they look stupid. Some may prefer blonde hair, some may prefer black hair. These things, while people may share different opinions, should still not make too big of a difference due to things averaging out.\n\nHowever, other things may not average out so well. For example, females with a flat chest/smaller body(for lack of a better term) are considered unattractive by most men. However, there are some men who find this physical feature quite attractive. But because this is likely a minority opinion, women with this physical characteristic may receive low ratings, and as a result, not show up in results to attractive men with this particular preference. There are plenty of factors in which a minority of people may find attractive, whereas most would find unattractive.

Changing the threshhold to something like 80% or 90% would result in positive reinforcement for those who receive it, without it being too negative if you don't receive it.\n\nLastly, it creates a narrow way of searching for a \"compatible\" SO.

The wiki entry that you mention in your post was written when OKCupid still used a 5-star rating system for its users. Within the past year or so the site changed over to a simple 'Like' system. Users who find someone attractive for whatever reason just click on a 'Like' button. In the past premium, paying users used to be able to filter search results by how many stars a person got. This is no longer the case, the star level filter has been replaced by a simple 'Profile Rating' filter. \n\nSince moving over to the new system I don't know if they still send out those \"You're hot!\" emails. I suspect that they no longer do. Finally I think the most important factor driving user satisfaction has nothing to do with 'hotness' ratings but has to do with the amount and quality of messages that an OKCupid user receives.

I'm a woman of slightly above average attractiveness (I guess? I don't know really. I mean, how do you even measure that??). I intentionally put terrible photos up on OkCupid. For one thing, I generaly dislike having my picture taken and as a result don't have easy access to many photos of myself. So I simply uploaded what few photos of me I found on facebook. Most of these broke all the usual rules: they featured me in a group of other people, for example, or as a smudge in the distance. Enough to give you an idea of my height, hair colour and basic facial features, but not much else. I would have put no photos at all, but I figured that would be going too far and turn me into a non-entity. \n\nThe reason I did this (besides laziness) was that I wasn't looking for men who would focus too much on physical features. I was planning on getting to know people, letting them to get to know me in person and after using the site to filter out men whose interests and opinions made them totally incompatible with me and taking it from there. This tactic worked like a charm: I met (after rigorous filtering) three men on OkCupid, all three of them expressed interest in a romantic relationship after getting to know me (as opposed to in the first message, because honestly), two of them ended up being good friends and the third is my current boyfriend of three years. I met him on the second week on the site.\n\nThose emails are a marketing tool. I don't remember getting one and would not expect too: my photos were not attractive, they were shit. My attractiveness is not measured by them - indeed it is not measured by my looks alone. I used OkCupid for the questions and measured other peoples' attractiveness first and foremost by the answers they gave. That system worked wonderfully for me and it is the number one piece of advice I'd give other prospective users - especially women.\n\nI will agree that as a marketing tool those emails are quite snide and potentially hurtful to those who are trying to look attractive on the site. But I would argue that's a problem not caused by OkCupid, but by our looks-obsessed culture. Without that context, those emails seem nothing but bizarre and within it their removal would do nothing to help individuals insecure about their appearance. The only thing that will help with that (and I say this as somebody who was insecure about her appearence for a long time and to some extent still is) is deciding to get over it - to be stronger than the culture we live in. Because that's the only two choices we have: we can point the finger at companies attempting to cash in on our obsession with looks or we can guide them towards other marketing techniques by making better choices as comsumers.

For 5 days I reviewed profiles of other Redditors. Some of them were more attractive than I am, and I've had tremendous success with online dating since my divorce in 2010.\n\nThe problem wasn't that they were unattractive. It was that they were fucking *clueless* as to what makes a good profile. No offense to anyone whose profile I reviewed and rewrote and to those that messaged me back with their successes I hope you're all still killing it.\n\nThe problem was they would often choose their absolute worst picture for their main photo. Some had a decent main, but their other photos were unflattering. Your best photo ever should be your main, and the rest should be of you smiling, doing interesting things, and at least one photo of you with friends where everybody is having fun and smiling.\n\nThe reality is that women and men rate differently. Every woman I've ever talked to finds a picture they like and then *reads your profile* to see if you're a douchenozzle. Men I've talked to tend to just blow through the rating feature based on photos and the sidebar of minimum info alone.\n\nThat leads to their second problem. The few women their photos did attract were reading their profiles (Some had views but no bites) the profiles were a mess of wishy-washy, \"not quite sure of myself\", meandering text that was decidedly unattractive. \n\nHonestly, they were all well employed in fantastic careers or at least on their way to one and many of them had done some really fantastic things. Traveled around the world, gone on charity missions, one even did some work at NASA. None of them had any of this shit listed on their profile.\n\nMy point is that every single one read like your last sentence. \"Meh.\". If you're \"Meh\" about yourself and about dating why would anyone bother with you? For some reason people have gotten to the point that we're all trying to be so politically correct and polite that we view any kind of criticism as \"hurting us\" or as a negative.\n\nIt should really be seen as a chance to improve yourself. It's information that is directly related to the areas that you need to improve specifically and that is *valuable* if you truly intend to improve. You have two choices at that point. Get butthurt or get better. I don't view this as a negative, but as a signal fire that you need to rethink your profile to attract someone.\n\n\nOne of these Redditors messaged me less than 12 hours after changing his profile saying that he already had inbox messages. Many of the others said the same in the following weeks. If it hadn't been for them finding out about this they would have continued with shit like this:\n\nAbout Me: \"I don't know, I'm just a regular guy I guess. If I tell you about me here what will we talk about lol\".\n\nThey don't know anything about you when they visit your profile. You've given them absolutely *nothing* to ask you on a first date. Awkward silence? Yeah, that sets the mood.\n\nThese guys all had great aspects to them, but none realized that nobody was going to divine that information from the oracle unless they put it out there in a positive profile. Finding out there was a \"top 25%\" was the catalyst that led them to improve so in that way it was a good thing.\n"}, {"id": "2qhgmz", "body": "Quick disclaimer before I start, I have not yet used OKCupid, nor have I used any dating service.

On top of this, police officers are generally neutral parties compared to others involved in a criminal case. For example, lets say you're on the jury of a murder case. The mother of the victim of this crime is brought in to testify. Do you think that she will have an unbiased testimony and won't skew her words or add/leave out details in an effort to have the defendant be found guilty? If anything the opposite is the case. Her testimony will most likely be heavily based on her emotions, while that of a neutral party with no personal connection to the victim like a police officer will be based on the facts of the case.

In a criminal case I don't see how the police would be on the side of the accused when they are the ones who arrested him/her in the first place. You say that it's the police's job to apprehend suspected criminals and collect evidence and it's the prosecution's job to to prove that someone is guilty, but that implies that the police are working to help the prosecution in any given case by finding evidence and arresting people accused of committing crimes.\n\nThe thing about the \"loophole\" that you're talking about is that it can only be exploited if the accused allows it to be exploited in the first place. If someone accused of a crime decides to speak with the police without anyone to legally represent them then they are willingly allowing that \"loophole\" to be exposed, and for this to happen in the first place then they would have to already have been made aware of their right to remain silent and right to an attorney through being read their Miranda rights."}, {"id": "cn664ky", "body": "&gt; Why would a police officer want to leave out details with malicious intent like you suggested they may do, or word things to change their meanings?\n\nThe sole reason reform is so slow in the US is judges basically say the same thing at trial.  \"But why would the police officer lie?!\"\n\nI think it's some sort of fallacy to say that \"Well, since they shouldn't, they don't\", while ignoring the very real fact that they do.

"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2qgu37", "body": "Liberal democratic government has numerous advantages over one-party rule by the Chinese Communist Party.\nFor one, leaders in a liberal democratic form of government have more incentive to be closer to the people, because they know that part of their power comes from winning elections. A leader who is closer to the people has more powerful, because he or she can demonstrate their popular support. For example, when the Indian PM, Narendra Modi, visited the United States, he was mobbed like a rock star in New York City by 20,000 people. It's hard to imagine a Chinese leader receiving such a reception.\n\nSecondly, in a liberal democratic system a free press and freedom of arts and culture do not threaten the government. Currently, China does not produce very good arts and culture. American shows, such as the Big Bang Theory are more popular in China than home grown ones. Korea has been far more successful at exporting its culture than China, despite being less than 1/10th the size. Why is China, such a big country, so poor as producing culture? Because creative artists are stifled by the PRC censorship machine. Besides arts, to remain in power the government also has to censor alternative belief systems, such as Christianity and Falun Gong. However, people should have the right to express their own belief systems. If belief systems are suppressed, this leads people to turn to materialism, hedonism, and xenophobia, which corrupt and degrade the culture.\n\nThirdly, the authoritarian government is pursuing a one-child policy that is very outdated, since the average Chinese woman already has only 1.5 children. Evidence from other East Asian countries suggests that the problem is an aging society and too few people, not too many. Demographically, this will weaken China's economy in the long term. Also, this is a cruel and inhumane policy because if you only have one child, and they are killed for whatever reason, then you will go into old age alone and with no hope. Only children also tend to be spoiled. In a liberal democratic society, people would be able to vote on whether they want to keep this policy, but in most free societies, it is a right to have more than one child for all citizens.\n\nFourthly, a liberal democratic China would have better relations with the outside world. The U.S. is the world's premiere superpower, both militarily, economically, culturally, and technologically. While some reports say that China has overtaken the U.S. economically, if it happened it was only be because China is much more populous than the U.S. The average Chinese still lives the life of a citizen of a developing country. The U.S. is still far ahead of China on science, innovation, having dynamic companies, etc. Therefore, it is important for China to have good relations with the U.S. This will be much more facilitated if the two countries share liberal, democratic values. China's relations with Japan and Taiwan will be much better for the same reason. Both of these countries are liberal democracies, and China very much wants good relations with Taiwan to effect some sort of future union. This will be made much easier if China is a democracy. Finally, studies show that it is very rare for two democracies to go to war with one another, so the chance of China being dragged into a war would be diminished.\n\nFifth, liberal democracy is the morally right form of government to have. Governments ask for a monopoly on power, so they must justify this monopoly on the basis of acting in the interests of the people. Who else to know the interests of the people than the people themselves? If the people of China really think the CCP is doing a good job, they can always vote in a CCP government in a democratic manner. The desire for having basic human rights, such as due process of law, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and input into one's government is not a Western value- it is a universal value. Hence why you see no clamor for authoritarianism in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n\nI believe that if the CCP initiated a peaceful transition to democracy, it could be carried out in a much more successful manner than the Soviet Union did in 1991. For one thing, the Soviet Union was divided into autonomous republics that took up huge chunks of the state. China, on the other hand, is a largely unitary state with a mono-ethnic population that has lasted for over 2,000 as a single civilization. Also, the Soviet Union had to change its whole economy from socialism to capitalism. China, on the other hand, is already a mixed economy and would not require such a drastic change. On the other hand, the leaders of the CCP would be seen historically as visionaries who finally completed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision of tutelage of China into a modern liberal democracy.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While some reports say that China has overtaken the U.S. economically, if it happened it was only be because China is much more populous than the U.S. The average Chinese still lives the life of a citizen of a developing country. The U.S. is still far ahead of China on science, innovation, having dynamic companies, etc. Therefore, it is important for China to have good relations with the U.S. This will be much more facilitated if the two countries share liberal, democratic values. China's relations with Japan and Taiwan will be much better for the same reason. Both of these countries are liberal democracies, and China very much wants good relations with Taiwan to effect some sort of future union. This will be made much easier if China is a democracy. Finally, studies show that it is very rare for two democracies to go to war with one another, so the chance of China being dragged into a war would be diminished.\n\nFifth, liberal democracy is the morally right form of government to have. Governments ask for a monopoly on power, so they must justify this monopoly on the basis of acting in the interests of the people. Who else to know the interests of the people than the people themselves? If the people of China really think the CCP is doing a good job, they can always vote in a CCP government in a democratic manner. The desire for having basic human rights, such as due process of law, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and input into one's government is not a Western value- it is a universal value. Hence why you see no clamor for authoritarianism in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n\nI believe that if the CCP initiated a peaceful transition to democracy, it could be carried out in a much more successful manner than the Soviet Union did in 1991. For one thing, the Soviet Union was divided into autonomous republics that took up huge chunks of the state. China, on the other hand, is a largely unitary state with a mono-ethnic population that has lasted for over 2,000 as a single civilization. Also, the Soviet Union had to change its whole economy from socialism to capitalism. China, on the other hand, is already a mixed economy and would not require such a drastic change. On the other hand, the leaders of the CCP would be seen historically as visionaries who finally completed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision of tutelage of China into a modern liberal democracy.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"}, {"id": "cn7a0pa", "body": "china boasts a middle class the size of the US.  no other country can make a similar claim."}, {"id": "2qgu37", "body": "Liberal democratic government has numerous advantages over one-party rule by the Chinese Communist Party.\nFor one, leaders in a liberal democratic form of government have more incentive to be closer to the people, because they know that part of their power comes from winning elections. A leader who is closer to the people has more powerful, because he or she can demonstrate their popular support. For example, when the Indian PM, Narendra Modi, visited the United States, he was mobbed like a rock star in New York City by 20,000 people. It's hard to imagine a Chinese leader receiving such a reception.\n\nSecondly, in a liberal democratic system a free press and freedom of arts and culture do not threaten the government. Currently, China does not produce very good arts and culture. American shows, such as the Big Bang Theory are more popular in China than home grown ones. Korea has been far more successful at exporting its culture than China, despite being less than 1/10th the size. Why is China, such a big country, so poor as producing culture? Because creative artists are stifled by the PRC censorship machine. Besides arts, to remain in power the government also has to censor alternative belief systems, such as Christianity and Falun Gong. However, people should have the right to express their own belief systems. If belief systems are suppressed, this leads people to turn to materialism, hedonism, and xenophobia, which corrupt and degrade the culture.\n\nThirdly, the authoritarian government is pursuing a one-child policy that is very outdated, since the average Chinese woman already has only 1.5 children. Evidence from other East Asian countries suggests that the problem is an aging society and too few people, not too many. Demographically, this will weaken China's economy in the long term. Also, this is a cruel and inhumane policy because if you only have one child, and they are killed for whatever reason, then you will go into old age alone and with no hope. Only children also tend to be spoiled. In a liberal democratic society, people would be able to vote on whether they want to keep this policy, but in most free societies, it is a right to have more than one child for all citizens.\n\nFourthly, a liberal democratic China would have better relations with the outside world. The U.S. is the world's premiere superpower, both militarily, economically, culturally, and technologically. While some reports say that China has overtaken the U.S. economically, if it happened it was only be because China is much more populous than the U.S. The average Chinese still lives the life of a citizen of a developing country. The U.S. is still far ahead of China on science, innovation, having dynamic companies, etc. Therefore, it is important for China to have good relations with the U.S. This will be much more facilitated if the two countries share liberal, democratic values. China's relations with Japan and Taiwan will be much better for the same reason. Both of these countries are liberal democracies, and China very much wants good relations with Taiwan to effect some sort of future union. This will be made much easier if China is a democracy. Finally, studies show that it is very rare for two democracies to go to war with one another, so the chance of China being dragged into a war would be diminished.\n\nFifth, liberal democracy is the morally right form of government to have. Governments ask for a monopoly on power, so they must justify this monopoly on the basis of acting in the interests of the people. Who else to know the interests of the people than the people themselves? If the people of China really think the CCP is doing a good job, they can always vote in a CCP government in a democratic manner. The desire for having basic human rights, such as due process of law, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and input into one's government is not a Western value- it is a universal value. Hence why you see no clamor for authoritarianism in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n\nI believe that if the CCP initiated a peaceful transition to democracy, it could be carried out in a much more successful manner than the Soviet Union did in 1991.

A leader who is closer to the people has more powerful, because he or she can demonstrate their popular support. For example, when the Indian PM, Narendra Modi, visited the United States, he was mobbed like a rock star in New York City by 20,000 people. It's hard to imagine a Chinese leader receiving such a reception.\n\nSecondly, in a liberal democratic system a free press and freedom of arts and culture do not threaten the government. Currently, China does not produce very good arts and culture. American shows, such as the Big Bang Theory are more popular in China than home grown ones. Korea has been far more successful at exporting its culture than China, despite being less than 1/10th the size. Why is China, such a big country, so poor as producing culture? Because creative artists are stifled by the PRC censorship machine. Besides arts, to remain in power the government also has to censor alternative belief systems, such as Christianity and Falun Gong. However, people should have the right to express their own belief systems. If belief systems are suppressed, this leads people to turn to materialism, hedonism, and xenophobia, which corrupt and degrade the culture.\n\nThirdly, the authoritarian government is pursuing a one-child policy that is very outdated, since the average Chinese woman already has only 1.5 children. Evidence from other East Asian countries suggests that the problem is an aging society and too few people, not too many. Demographically, this will weaken China's economy in the long term. Also, this is a cruel and inhumane policy because if you only have one child, and they are killed for whatever reason, then you will go into old age alone and with no hope. Only children also tend to be spoiled. In a liberal democratic society, people would be able to vote on whether they want to keep this policy, but in most free societies, it is a right to have more than one child for all citizens.\n\nFourthly, a liberal democratic China would have better relations with the outside world. The U.S. is the world's premiere superpower, both militarily, economically, culturally, and technologically. While some reports say that China has overtaken the U.S. economically, if it happened it was only be because China is much more populous than the U.S. The average Chinese still lives the life of a citizen of a developing country. The U.S. is still far ahead of China on science, innovation, having dynamic companies, etc. Therefore, it is important for China to have good relations with the U.S. This will be much more facilitated if the two countries share liberal, democratic values. China's relations with Japan and Taiwan will be much better for the same reason. Both of these countries are liberal democracies, and China very much wants good relations with Taiwan to effect some sort of future union. This will be made much easier if China is a democracy. Finally, studies show that it is very rare for two democracies to go to war with one another, so the chance of China being dragged into a war would be diminished.\n\nFifth, liberal democracy is the morally right form of government to have. Governments ask for a monopoly on power, so they must justify this monopoly on the basis of acting in the interests of the people. Who else to know the interests of the people than the people themselves? If the people of China really think the CCP is doing a good job, they can always vote in a CCP government in a democratic manner. The desire for having basic human rights, such as due process of law, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and input into one's government is not a Western value- it is a universal value. Hence why you see no clamor for authoritarianism in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n\nI believe that if the CCP initiated a peaceful transition to democracy, it could be carried out in a much more successful manner than the Soviet Union did in 1991. For one thing, the Soviet Union was divided into autonomous republics that took up huge chunks of the state. China, on the other hand, is a largely unitary state with a mono-ethnic population that has lasted for over 2,000 as a single civilization. Also, the Soviet Union had to change its whole economy from socialism to capitalism. China, on the other hand, is already a mixed economy and would not require such a drastic change. On the other hand, the leaders of the CCP would be seen historically as visionaries who finally completed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision of tutelage of China into a modern liberal democracy.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Owning a single-family home in a high-quality area would be a status symbol, but just living their wouldn't.\n\nSo, without that, what do we have? About the only thing you can buy with your money at that point is human-intensive services. Sure, you *could* use a robot to clean your house, but do you want people to think you are poor? Show off your wealth by hiring a butler instead. You *could* put your kid through a MOOC to teach them algebra, but you're better than that. Hire an expensive private tutor instead. You *could* have a robot do your hair or nails, but really? What are you, a common peasant? Pay for the fancy salon instead and show off your fabulous wealth. You *could* use a driverless car, but having someone drive you around is just so much more classy. \n\nIn short, in a world where the cost of physical goods is near zero, the only way to show off your wealth is to hire a bunch of people as a status symbol.\n\nSo, what does retain "}, {"id": "cn65fkv", "body": "\u2206\n\nSo instead of genocide we simply go back to feudalism.

That can be a middle-class job for sure. Butlers also make good money. Then of course, middle class people will also seek services from other middle class people. I don't see why a middle class can't thrive based only off of service-industry goods. Only a small fraction of the population currently is directly employed in farming, manufacturing, or home construction. Hell, I myself tutor a lot on the side.

That might be some of the most urbanized, crowded highway in the country.  They don't seem to have a problem with it over there.  It's pretty hard to have more than three exits in a mile.\n\nNear me, the Garden State Parkway does this the best, IMO.  Each exit usually has an A &amp; B, but hardly ever anything more than that.  Coming off that N/S road, an A exit is usually west &amp; B exit is usually east.  Using that system, I've seen one C exit (I-295 coming out of Philadelphia when a few roads diverge at once), but it's not common."}, {"id": "2qgkou", "body": "There are two major methods of identifying highway exits in the United States. One is to identify them by mile marker, the other is to use a simple ordinal system.\n\nThe state of New York identifies highway exits by simply choosing one end of the highway and starting to count exits up one at a time. For example, exit 1 on I-90 is located in Yonkers, while exit 61 is the last before the Pennsylvania border. [A list of the exits.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway#Mainline_2)\n\nThis has a number of significant problems. First, the addition of new exits results in the addition of extremely confusing \"A\" and \"B\" exits. It's much easier than renumbering all the exits on the highway, but it's also extremely confusing. Second, portions of the highway not on the main line need a separate system. The NYS Thruway uses B1-B3 for the connector to the Massachusetts Turnpike. And third, there is no way of knowing how far it is to the next exit. I know I got on at exit 12 and need to get off at exit 20, but I have no idea if the distance is 20 miles or 120 miles.\n\nThe second option is far superior. States like Ohio and Pennsylvania identify highway exits by the mile marker. If you get on the highway at exit 20 and plan to get off at exit 120, you know that you will be driving 100 miles. This is very sensible. Also, adding a new exit is simple! If there is no other exit in that highway mile, adding a new number is trivial. In the case of multiple exits in the same mile, A and B is easy to understand and also alerts drivers to the fact that multiple exits will be happening in a short space of road.\n\nFinally, states like New York are *already* numbering the miles on their highways to use in support of law enforcement and emergency crews to identify the location of accidents.
