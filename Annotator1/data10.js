Ditto that for every other domestic food animal, and even animals that we hunt for food: at the very least we are less vicious than other predators in that we wait until the animal is definitely dead before we start eating it. \n\nI'm not arguing that death at the hands of humans is better than living on; in the general sense, living on is better than just about any death; I'm arguing that of the potential ways to die, being killed is the best an animal can realistically hope for.\n\nEDIT: I keep forgetting to add this, but I also think that quality of life is something that should be accounted for when debating this. How much does a cow need to fear predators when it's under the watch of a farmer? (keep in mind, my defense is for traditional-type farms, not the admittedly abhorrent factory farms, from which I don't buy any meat). Up until its last day, it is living essentially a cow vacation. Plenty of grass to eat, maybe the occasional milking but other than that, it's generally less stressful (assuming animals feel stress at all, which I'm assuming you would believe if you believe animals can suffer, as stress is the basis for suffering) up until the very last second. So, in ultimate terms of maximum hedons versus stressors per lifetime, livestock does pretty damn well."}, {"id": "cnfisa0", "body": "&gt;In a day, I eat maybe 1/3 of a cow or 1/2 of a chicken if I'm hungry.

That's my takeaway from the ESPN article.\n\nThink of how many teams get that valuable time that would otherwise not have it.  Sure, the bottom of the barrel Power 5 conference teams may not make a bowl, but the mid and low tier bowl teams still get a shot at a bowl game and extra practice time, they get a chance to improve and recruit, so the entire college game is more competitive.  Lets say you cut the number of bowls to 12, where basically only the top 25 teams get to play a bowl.  You may see less mobility and change among those top 25 and the rest of the FBS.  \n\n\n&gt;I'm not saying there should be only six games.

Then your Sun Bowl could really mean something, the winner moving on to the Peach Bowl to face a top 8 team who had a bye, and then the winner of that going to the Rose. \n\nThis would mean a lot of extra games for the players, who are also supposedly students.  I don't see them expanding the national championship tourney beyond 8 teams (3 extra games).  All P5 conferences minus the big 12 have a conference championship game, so that kind of makes a 24 team playoff redundant.  In the college game, i believe you could say with relative certainty that the best team in the country is among the top 8.\n\nIf the playoffs are really sccessful, i could see them adding an Tier 2 tourney, with teams ranked 9-16 playing in something equivalent to an NIT tourney.\n\n&gt;It would also have the effect that the most meaningful games would still be last - I'm more annoyed by that than by anything else: we already had the semifinals, why are all these other teams still playing?\n\nThis is a logistical issue.  You've got a lot of games to schedule around New Years, a semi final, followed by a final.  You don't want to play the finals right after the semis.  I think a 10 day break is perfect.  But sandwiching 25 bowl games before the semis can be problematic.  Scheduling all the games before the semis give people something to watch between the two games, and keeps people interested in bowl week during the break, and alleviates the scheduling pressure beforehand.

This lead to mexican style prison(not official name), in witch they have city inside the prison with people living there lives normally complete with elections, buying better houses and even a judicial system and a prison inside the prison!\n\nThen you have the old testament style prison (idem), in witch the goal of the prison is though to be to punish people, the prisons in the USA (please correct me if I am wrong, I would love to be wrong about this :). In it you have story of people evading from prison to get basic healthcare done (like going to the dentist after three week of pain!).\n\nAnd finally you have the Scandinavian style prison where the goal of the prison is seen as \"reeducating\" the inmate until they are again deemed \"fit to the society\". In it you have story like mass murderer complaining of \"only\" having a PS2 instead of a PS3 to play with.\n\nPersonally I am a fan of the 3rd type but I'll admit that each type has its flaw and each correspond of a different worldview\n\nNow back to the point, you have to recognise that your point make sense under old testament style prison, but not under Mexican prisons and less under the Scandinavian one (if you're gonna spend money on getting someone to be productive again you want him/her to live linger so you get more for your work but it start being an economical decision)"}, {"id": "2rdtde", "body": "Though it has been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court that withholding medical treatment for individuals incarcerated by the justice system is in violation of the 8th amendment.

Any alcoholic - no matter how law-abiding - will have to stay abstinent for at least 6 month before even being considered for listing, just as any other form of drug abuse will require a 6-month period of abstinence. And any relapse (if noticed by your doctors) will get you kicked of that waiting list.\n\nThis isn't because doctors consider alcoholism or other kinds of substance abuse somehow reprehensible. It is a decision based on simple medical facts: Organ recipients need to follow certain safety precautions and take anti-rejection drugs every single day for the rest of their lifes to avoid rejection. Compliance therefore isn't a matter of politeness towards your doctor but a matter of life and death.\n\nNobody can predict the future and even the most disciplined and reasonable people fail, but people with a history of drug abuse who can't manage to stay sober/clean for 6 month prior to transplant are even less likely to do so later. And those anti-rejection drugs are often ripe with serious side-effects, so even someone in their right mind and fully aware of the consequences will at times be tempted to skip them. \n\nSo when people are denied a transplant based on active drug abuse this doesn't happen because they don't *deserve* one but because they won't *benefit* from it - a new organ won't do them any good without the ability to prevent rejection. It doesn't matter if they're reckless, ignorant, irresponsible or can't take those meds for good reasons. It doesn't matter if they are law-abiding citizens with an alcohol addiction or serial killers on crack - either they take those drugs every single day at the same time or their immune system will destroy the new organ and leave them worse off than before transplant."}, {"id": "2rdtde", "body": "Though it has been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court that withholding medical treatment for individuals incarcerated by the justice system is in violation of the 8th amendment.

Here's just a short list.\n\n#1. Fixing a real problem: Your appendix burst. You're going to die. You got stabbed. You shattered a bone.\n\n#2. Fixing a potential problem. You've got gallstones. They start as a minor pain in the butt. They get worse. They can develop pancreatitis. That can kill you. \n\n#3. Resolving an issue that affects you daily. Torn ligaments can cause pain you have to deal with every day, or may make your job difficult. You might be done having kids and want your tubes tied. You might want your vision corrected because it makes you ineligible to be in the army.\n\n#4. Resolving a personal dislike. This in general is the category people have judgements on. Things like breast implants or nose jobs. But this can also include corrective surgeries, such as burn victims.  \n\n#5. Trying to figure out an issue. You're only going to hit this one when all else fails. Doctors aren't willing to just jump in and swim around your organs for fun. At this point you've gotten a lot of exams, you've gone through a lot of medications, you've gone to specialists and probably had a lot of tests done, some which can be very unpleasant. \n\nSo, you could hit 20 and get your vision corrected because you want to play sports or something. You hit 25 and decide you don't want any more kids. You hit 30 and your knees start to hurt from your manual labor job. You hit 35 and your stomach is serious crawling-on-the-floor pain once a week causing you to miss work. You hit 40 and a blood test returns signs of cancer or a small tumor that needs to be removed. And it can only get worse the older you get.\n\nIs a surgery a year typical or reasonable? No, probably not, unless you have some serious medical problems, which is completely possible. But for a small amount of time, having a lot of medical procedures done is not unreasonable.\n\nReally though, it's none of your business. Unless people are going to back-allies or somewhere really shady, you'll have a hard time finding doctors willing to undergo unnecessary procedures. I'd wager doing so - especially on a regular basis - would put them at some high legal risks. \n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, as someone who has had surgery once... it's not fun. Anyone who has had it once knows that. It's scary, it's expensive, it's dangerous, it's time consuming, and its incredibly unpleasant and at times painful.

Allowing the free market to do its job after the war was what really got the US out of The Depression.\n\nI think that you're probably overemphasizing the impact of policies you like as much as you accuse FDR haigrophiers of overemphasizing policies they like.  The Great Depression was a worldwide economic downturn which persisted for a long time in pretty much the whole world.  The best case I've seen for any policy being implicated is monetary policy.  In their seminal *Monetary History of the United States,* Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz lay out the incredible decline in the money supply that accompanied the depression.  And a lot of research has gone into money supply and the depression - specificially looking at which countries abandoned the gold standard and when.  Generally those studies find that the earlier a country abandoned gold and allowed fiat currency growth the faster their recovery from the depression.  [This speech](http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/speeches/2004/200403022/default.htm) by Ben Bernanke from before he was Fed chair is a good summary.  Apart from that, the money supply was a policy set by the Federal Reserve, not the President.  And FDR did act against the gold standard extremely early in his Presidency.  Quoting from that Bernanke speech:\n\n&gt;The finding that leaving the gold standard was the key to recovery from the Great Depression was certainly confirmed by the U.S. experience. One of the first actions of President Roosevelt was to eliminate the constraint on U.S. monetary policy created by the gold standard, first by allowing the dollar to float and then by resetting its value at a significantly lower level. The new President also addressed another major source of monetary contraction, the ongoing banking crisis. Within days of his inauguration, Roosevelt declared a \"bank holiday,\" shutting down all the banks in the country. Banks were allowed to reopen only when certified to be in sound financial condition. Roosevelt pursued other measures to stabilize the banking system as well, such as the creation of a deposit insurance program. With the gold standard constraint removed and the banking system stabilized, the money supply and the price level began to rise. Between Roosevelt's coming to power in 1933 and the recession of 1937-38, the economy grew strongly."}, {"id": "cnfna4s", "body": "This agrees with OP, it doesn't try to change OPs view.\n\nEDIT: I should say that Roosevelt's good policies were limited, so very little of what FDR did was helpful.

And there was simultaneous massive monetary stimulus during the war.  Section C, starting on numbered page 34 of the Rockoff paper provides a pretty good summary of the factors that led to the 1946 boom where per capita consumption soared like 10% even as the brakes were put hard on stimulus.\n\nA potential counterfactual would be what the economy would look like if the government had taxed enough to cover its expenditures during the war years.\n\nReconversion was a fine program I suppose, though if we're going to credit it to a President, Truman would probably get the credit.\n\nAnyway, I stand by my point made in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rdika/cmv_fdr_did_not_get_the_united_states_out_of_the/cnevgcb) that the primary driver of the Depression and recovery was monetary policy, which is outside the President's hands.

He also notes that the money supply did not tighten until after the recession began.[7]\n* Some argue that the Undistributed profits tax enacted in 1936 caused a panic in Corporate America.

Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.  \n            \nAmerica's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. \n                        \n(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)         \n               \n**Was view changed?**  \nIts a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?  Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?          -(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-   \n        \n                 \n(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment, i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )    \n                          \nThen there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.\n            \nThen there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.  Modern technology like the internet must be considered.\n                 \n             \nYes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost.                  \n           \n            \n**EDIT:** \n             \nI'll be without internet for a few days.

As they are deeply interrelated I'll endeavor to weave examples of both in my rebuttal of the critics. The economic argument presented by critics (that even if unskilled the 55 million natives would outweigh their cost through tax contributions AND their presence in the labour force would discourage liberal immigration policy (assumed to be uniformly economically bad, which is very much in dispute)) is blatantly a-historic; for one cannot assume that absent 'abortion' the same rates of economic productivity, and economic advancement seen since 1973 would obtain. The economic productivity of working class families emerged in an era where family planning could be followed 'strictly' without being disrupted by the serendipity of pregnancy. The argument that the 'imaginary 55 million' would have the same economic achievement rates as their parents cannot be assumed AND the economic achievement of the parents as seen cannot be assumed as they achieved what they did in the context of 'complete family planning control.' In short we have two (potentially three generations) where the economic data is speculative at best. In this case it becomes a question of whether economic achievement (as observed in the real world) relied on liberalized access to 'abortion.' With that in mind there is (at least in most major academic works) consensus that in low SES environments economic achievement did (the absolute percentage is still in debate) rely on the abortion context (for i.e. women whom had abortions were roughly a third more likely to move from low SES to low-middle SES than those whom did not have an abortion). Finally it is only well-within the domain of 'middle class' that economists can be certain that one is actually contributing in taxes what one consumes in resources (the actual tax bracket is hotly debated), but assuming that most low SES parents raise predominately low SES kids (NOTE this is a relatively safe assumption as American economic mobility is distressingly low) we can be certain that the total economic cost of 55 million more Americans is a net resource negative NOT net resource positive.

The attitude of human value as \"what they [potentially] contributed to me/Exxon Mobile\" is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit.\n\nIt's the same problem with war: Once killing foreigners is an acceptable/inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it. Other countries also build militaries to do so and to \"defend\" against each other, and its no longer viewed as a hostile or paranoid thing to do because everybody's doing it and so must do it. It becomes a recursive loop and generates a hostile attitude towards foreigners and other countries.\n\nThis works on the inverse too. When we went to the moon, our horizons and view of mankind changed. Once we better understood such objects, nature worship definitely changed. You'll be hard-pressed to find moon worshipers today, and the \"religions of the book\" may be going out of style as highly literate people have access to more historical data and the time to translate The Bible, Torah, and Quran in context for themselves. Also, it was once normal for religions to kill masses of unbelievers; now it's seen as wrong, even by the religions themselves.

The attitude of human value as \"what they [potentially] contributed to me/Exxon Mobile\" is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit.\n\nIt's the same problem with war: Once killing foreigners is an acceptable/inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it.

People grow up learning different things, and get this, having different views. \n     \nThen you go on to, instead of making an actual argument to prove me wrong, to say that I am not capable of holding these views without being inferior. \n    \nReally, were you home-schooled? Your views are indicative of an angsty 20 year old who has not had much world exposure, one that wasn't weened until the age of 15.\n    \n You also have special snowflake syndrome. All you do is sputter about whatever little information that you have while maintaining an illusion of superiority so that i'll trust how very *smart* you sound. I'm supposed to just accept your views without you proving them to be correct? This explains how long-winded you are, its apart of the illusion.\n    \nAlso, your \"Harvard studies, read them\" was a pretty vain attempt of seeming more intelligent and of having more authority without adding anything new to the discussion.\n   \n&gt;You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had\n   \nRead: post title.  \n    \n&gt;and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect.\n      \n 600 people would at least agree that it was an interesting thought.\n     \n&gt;It's good that you've distanced yourself from your view in saying you're not that confident in it. It's one step closer to abandoning it.\n    \nI'm not going to *abandon* a view, i'm going to be presented with new information that changes my mind.           \n       \n&gt;Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond.\n      \nOh? Then why is this post so popular? Again, instead of making actual arguments, all you're doing is to attempt to devalue me and the idea. \n      \n&gt;I did anticipate this, and I'm not doing it to troll, but I really do want to change your view--more specifically, that sort of thinking.

Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.  \n            \nAmerica's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. \n                        \n(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)         \n               \n**Was view changed?**  \nIts a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?  Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?          -(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-   \n        \n                 \n(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value.
