Just basic back massages using oil, with some essential oils added for \"relaxation\". The first time we went, I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy afterwards and had to sit down for 20-30 minutes till it passed off. Eventually we worked out it was the essential oils - if I got a massage with just carrier oil (almond?) I was fine; if she added essential oils I was sick.\n\nI wouldn't expect something so negative to be a placebo effect (I had either neutral or mildly positive expectations for essential oils). And the effect seemed repeatable and strong. So, I wouldn't say I've found essential oils to be helpful for anything (except making me feel sick) but on the principle that if a drug has a real effect on the body then it should also be able to have side-effects - something natural medicine enthusiasts seem to often ignore - I suppose this has made me more open to the possibility that they have genuine physiological effects.\n\nProbably worth pointing out though that none of my friends had this reaction!\n\nFrom an actual scientific evidence point of view there are at least a few cases where there are real studies to support e.g. tea tree oil having antiseptic properties, but maybe these cases are exceptions."}, {"id": "2ro0ti", "body": "My wife has recently gotten deeply involved/obsessed with the healing properties of essential oils.

Certainly safer than many, if not all, other forms of travel per mile. That said, a few things have made me petrified to fly.\n\n1.) I used to be a pilot (small, 4-seater planes) and had a near-crash experience. I was practicing engine failures with an instructor. I had selected a field where I could land if this were a real emergency. We pulled the power out. About 100 feet above the ground, my instructor informed me that I had failed the exercise as we were too far down field, and that I would hit the trees ahead of us if this were a real emergency. My instructor told me that he we were going to put the power back in and try again. However, as he put the power back in, the engine just sputtered. My instructor took the controls from me. The engine continued to sputter. My instructor then informed me that he was going to position the wings to take the brunt of the hit. At that point, I thought that was it. This is how I die. Luckily, the engine did kick back in, and it seemed like we just avoided hitting the tops of those trees. Nevertheless, that experience shook me pretty hard, and I gave up piloting soon after.\n\n2.) I had a good friend die on a commercial flight in 2009. After his death, I imagined over and over again how he must have spent the last few minutes of his life. At one point being okay, then all of a sudden the plane going into stomach-turning up and down undulation, before finally seeing the ground approaching way too fast.

It involves trusting a stranger with your life. It involves performing a task no human being was evolved to perform, at speeds humans cannot comprehend. Hell, when you're flying 400 MPH in the air it *feels* like you're not moving at all! Your brain simply cannot comprehend how fast you are going relative to the air around you.\n\n94% of all plane crashes are due to \"general aviation\" that includes smaller planes flown by amateurs and corporate flights. In contrast, the accident rate for commercial planes is about 40x lower. \n\nSo yes, IMO flying is scary. As is driving a car. As is riding a bike. All of these things are dangerous activities, where human beings operate heavy machinery that could kill them in an instant (or in the case of biking, operating a safe machine while heavy machinery drives all around you). And indeed yes, people die *all the fucking time in cars or bicycles and planes. Yes, you'd even hear about more plane accidents if private jets were more common*. \n\n\nAnyways yes, general aviation is fucking dangerous, especially compared to cars. Commercial aviation is much, much safer. And cars are somewhere in between those two. \n\nBut luckily, at least for commercial flying, we are living in the safest era of air travel in history. Today's modern aircraft engines inside the new Boeing and Airbuses are literally hundreds of times more reliable than any engine before them (Airliners know that they must improve reliability by several factors, or else planes will be falling out of the sky every week when more and more people use air travel). Aircraft engineering and piloting is so well defined that most modern aircraft are piloted by computers that can be trusted to be better pilots than humans ever could. Improvements in aviation have made pilot error less of a problem. Modern airliners have been in the business long enough to know to avoid all the risky situations that cause accidents. In my opinion, American airliners are trustworthy. Only the best pilots in the world are allowed to fly their planes. Statistically, your pilot is more capable of getting you to your destination safely than your father/husband/wife/mother is capable of driving you there. \n\nBut private planes? Thanks, but no thanks. "}, {"id": "2rnrxj", "body": "I'm not sure this is a view that can be changed, since it is an irrational fear.

My instructor told me that he we were going to put the power back in and try again. However, as he put the power back in, the engine just sputtered. My instructor took the controls from me. The engine continued to sputter. My instructor then informed me that he was going to position the wings to take the brunt of the hit. At that point, I thought that was it. This is how I die. Luckily, the engine did kick back in, and it seemed like we just avoided hitting the tops of those trees. Nevertheless, that experience shook me pretty hard, and I gave up piloting soon after.\n\n2.)

I imagine how his body must have shattered upon impact -- his internal organs not being able to keep up with the rapid deceleration of the rest of his body, shrapnel hitting and tearing up his body, then his skeleton shattering as it hit something hard before being swallowed up by a large fire all in a moment. I don't know if this is a scientifically accurate portrayal of his death, but this is how I imagine it anyway. It haunts me. What adds to my discomfort is the FDA report on the crash. They focused on the idle banter between the pilots right before the emergency. They focus on the fact that the pilots responded incorrectly to the emergency. Very little was said about the fact that the pilots were horrifically underrested, underpaid, and overworked. That seems to be a systemic problem that they refused to address, and it shakes my confidence in the governing body of aviation, and thus aviation as a whole.\n\n3.) I've flown on commercial flights a few times since my friend's death. Every time, I am struck by horrifying anxiety attacks. I feel closed in, trapped. I feel like I have no control.

I feel like I can't breathe. It is a very frightening experience for me.\n\nBecause of these experiences I think my subconscious mind has overridden my rational mind. To me, flying is scary.

I could cite statistics about the safety of flying compared to other travel, but that wouldn't have a point since you acknowledge that already. What I can tell you is a bit about how planes are designed, specifically commercial planes. They are designed purposefully to be able to fly with semi-incompetent pilots. Note that this doesn't mean that the airlines hire incompetent pilots, but if they did chances are you would still make it to your destination safely. \n\nWithout going into all of the derivations and stuff, which are quite lengthy, I can tell you that planes are built to autocorrect themselves. If the plane starts to pitch forward it is built in such a way that the plane will right itself without pilot input, up to a surprisingly large angle. Same if it pitches backwards, it will tend to right itself and continue on a level flight. This isn't the result of a computer system, but a result of the physical shape and weight distribution of the plane itself, and it will happen automatically and every time.\n\nYou don't have any control in an airplane, but that is for the best honestly. Manual control can override all of the safety features in a plane. Manual control is what will crash the plane more often than not, you not having control is actually helping you stay in the air"}, {"id": "2rnrxj", "body": "I'm not sure this is a view that can be changed, since it is an irrational fear. However, I sure would like to change it, so let's see if it can be done.\n\nI am aware that flying is perfectly safe on an intellectual level. Certainly safer than many, if not all, other forms of travel per mile. That said, a few things have made me petrified to fly.\n\n1.) I used to be a pilot (small, 4-seater planes) and had a near-crash experience. I was practicing engine failures with an instructor. I had selected a field where I could land if this were a real emergency. We pulled the power out. About 100 feet above the ground, my instructor informed me that I had failed the exercise as we were too far down field, and that I would hit the trees ahead of us if this were a real emergency. My instructor told me that he we were going to put the power back in and try again. However, as he put the power back in, the engine just sputtered. My instructor took the controls from me. The engine continued to sputter. My instructor then informed me that he was going to position the wings to take the brunt of the hit. At that point, I thought that was it. This is how I die. Luckily, the engine did kick back in, and it seemed like we just avoided hitting the tops of those trees. Nevertheless, that experience shook me pretty hard, and I gave up piloting soon after.\n\n2.)

There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). \n\nI think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.

A man walked into a crowded, public place, and begins shooting without warning.  Now imagine that a few people in the audience begin returning fire.

Do you think that all of the 20% of people with guns in the building will correctly guess that there is only one hostile target?  Now shots are coming from every direction, and the 80% of the crowd without guns have no idea which way they should be running to get to safety.  They are running in every direction, unpredictably entering the line of fire of the people with guns.  Now think about what happens when the police arrive and have no idea who they should consider a threat and who is a friendly, yet need to make that distinction immediately or risk being shot themselves.  \n\nI think in many cases a confusing crossfire resulting in even more deaths is the only realistic outcome we can expect.  There will also be scenarios where all or most of the people in the area being attacked know each other well enough to recognize friend from foe, but in general these kinds of things happen in public places where people are strangers to one another.  In those situations the panic and confusion of adding more gunfire will usually make things worse.  Add in the fact that people are more likely to be killed by their own gun in either a home accident or a suicide than they are of using it to defend themselves and I don't see any reason to believe the proposed scenario would lead to a decrease in deaths."}, {"id": "cnhs9za", "body": "See, you say this.

And the more people in the crowd all acting on their own, with no knowledge of which other shooters they should be shooting and and which ones they should be helping, the worse the situation is going to become.  \n\nI think that scenario is more likely, especially if we start encouraging a social norm that as many people as possible should be prepared to open fire at a moments notice.  So I'll play the odds and say that we should avoid a culture with that expectation.

There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). \n\nI think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the \"not one of us\" (pack) mentality and escalation of \"police state\".\nChange my view.\n\nPS: I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.\n\nEDIT: Awarded a delta to a comment which didn't refute this idea but led me to change my view that it would be best realized with paralyzing weapons rather then guns: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnr30/cmv_i_think_the_paris_shooting_makes_a_good_case/cni3o83\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Get a Nexus 5 (or old Moto X); they are dumb cheap and very good.\n\n---\n\nOne of the biggest issues with Android right now is that \"Android\" on one phone is usually not equal to \"Android\" on another. To explain what I mean by this, a bit of history is needed.\n\nOn its own, Android as a product is mostly open-source, and the license by which it is governed allows anyone to download and modify it as they please. This design decision was intentional: every other mobile platform (Windows Mobile and Symbian, mostly) during Android's infant years was locked down and, consequently, was very expensive (or nearly impossible) for hobbyists to obtain. This, amongst many other things, slowed innovation, and making Android open-source was Android's way of stirring up competition. \n\nWhile this was *very* successful in getting Android onto just about anything with a CPU (it is arguably the most widely-used form of Linux in the world, and it overtook Symbian in becoming the world's most popular mobile OS a few years ago), it also gave this same liberty to cell phone carriers and cell phone manufacturers.\n\nOne of Android's biggest problems for its first few years was its user experience. The look and feel of Android was much closer to what a developer would want instead of what most of its audience wanted. iPhone OS was simple to use, easy to understand and its apps were very, very pretty. \n\nAndroid was none of those things...but it was free and easy to obtain. Samsung decided to chase that iPhone money by making a phone, the Galaxy S, that was thinner and more powerful than its competitor. However, they knew that hardware alone wouldn't help them, so they studied iPhone OS extensively, learned what those users wanted in a phone and spent many, many millions of dollars in modifying Android into their own experience called TouchWiz. \n\nThis was a brilliant move at the time. TouchWiz was a LOT better and more feature-rich than stock Android, spelling and grammatical errors aside. (\"Sweep to unlock,\" anyone?) The phone also looked a lot cooler, and, most importantly, its screen was bigger. However, Samsung had to write A LOT of custom hardware code to make this happen, most of which didn't (and still doesn't) play nicely with stock Android at all. (This is why most ROMs are marginally unstable at best on Samsung devices.)\n\nAndroid, now under Google's wing, caught up over the years and made significant improvements to its OS. Google knew they couldn't strong-arm Samsung (who was now beginning to architect cloud services for its own modified version of Android, some of which completely mimicked Google's own offerings ) into using their stock software without losing them and most of their market-share with it. So they, also being a stupidly-rich company, took a big bet by making their own line of phones: the Nexus line. \n\nGoogle's Nexus devices have always been about presenting Android (and their services) in its truest form while giving developers and hobbyists the option to unlock them and go crazy. They are usually symbolic of what Google thinks that the Android ecosystem should be driving themselves towards. That hasn't stopped Samsung (and the companies that followed their footsteps) from implementing crazy and completely unsupported stuff (6\" screens, Wacom digitisers, edge screens, etc.), though they've been cooperating with Google more lately and not *completely* stepping on their toes these days.\n\nTo wrap this up, if you're unsatisifed with your Android device, it might be worth your while to try a Nexus device. You might like what you find.\n"}, {"id": "2rnlmm", "body": "I have had a Samsung Galaxy S3 for a few years now and I just don't like the way Android works on it.

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Never look away from the road in front for more than 2-3 seconds at a time? Leave a gap when pulling up to an intersection to aid in escaping being rear-ended? Scan every intersection before entering? Attempt to maintain a staggered formation when driving on the highway?

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Let's take your example: \n\n&gt;The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged.\n\nActually, it would have also prevented your being mugged had you left 10 minutes later. It further likely would have prevented your mugging had one of you been armed. If the mugger's spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you, and this delayed them so you passed before they did, it would have prevented your mugging. \n\nYour being mugged is a *statistical* outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. There's no other causal factor that would have actually *prevented* the situation, only changed the probabilities, and you can't really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. \n\nAbsolute \"causation\" isn't a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment aren't very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment, it's to address the root cause of the statistical problem. \n\nWe can't, nor should we, do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. \n\nWe have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you \"should\" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged.\n\nIt's not necessarily \"wrong\" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal. It's not too helpful, because people don't really have enough information, nor training in statistical theory, to apply that information. \n\nBut it's really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's \"obvious to you\" that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. \n\nIf you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let's say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it's worth that cost to them.\n\nAnd that's about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town, and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger, you're not doing anyone any favors, and are actually doing them harm, statistically.\n\nWhen you talk to an actual *victim* about these things, realize that they *already* probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior, because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. \n\nAlmost in every case, if you're speaking to a *victim*, it would be more accurate to *downplay* the risks that they took, if your goal is to actually statistically help them. \n\nIf someone is in a plane crash and is injured, your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... it's just a lot less dangerous than driving, which is what they're likely to do instead. \n\nSocietally speaking, we have to be very careful what we warn people about, because everyone's mileage varies.

In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. There's no other causal factor that would have actually *prevented* the situation, only changed the probabilities, and you can't really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. \n\nAbsolute \"causation\" isn't a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment aren't very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment, it's to address the root cause of the statistical problem. \n\nWe can't, nor should we, do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. \n\nWe have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you \"should\" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged.\n\nIt's not necessarily \"wrong\" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal. It's not too helpful, because people don't really have enough information, nor training in statistical theory, to apply that information. \n\nBut it's really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's \"obvious to you\" that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. \n\nIf you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let's say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it's worth that cost to them.\n\nAnd that's about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town, and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger, you're not doing anyone any favors, and are actually doing them harm, statistically.\n\nWhen you talk to an actual *victim* about these things, realize that they *already* probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior, because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. \n\nAlmost in every case, if you're speaking to a *victim*, it would be more accurate to *downplay* the risks that they took, if your goal is to actually statistically help them. \n\nIf someone is in a plane crash and is injured, your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... it's just a lot less dangerous than driving, which is what they're likely to do instead. \n\nSocietally speaking, we have to be very careful what we warn people about, because everyone's mileage varies.

Plenty of people shrug and say \"it could have happened to anyone, there was nothing I could do.\" It's genuinely useful to try to help them from becoming a victim again - and they can spread the info to others to help prevent victims piling up.\n\n&gt;All you're doing is blaming the victim.\n\nThat's *not* blaming the victim. You're not absolving the assailant of responsibility (\"he couldn't help himself\"), you're still placing blame firmly on the person who committed the crime. They're the ones to be charged. But that doesn't mean the victim is without fault. Their choices led to that situation. They contributed to their victimhood. That doesn't mean they're to blame, it means they have some fault in the matter - even if it's a small amount. Understanding that doesn't mean you're blaming the victim.\n\nAnd again, why is trying to help victims (or potential victims) take precautions a bad thing?\n\n&gt;The most dangerous \"neighborhood\" in America for blacks to live in is apparently Nebraska. It has an annual murder incidence of around 34/100,000. Should all the blacks in the state move out?\n\nI can't make decisions for other people. But I *could* advise blacks in Nebraska of that factoid, and give them tips on areas to avoid, or suggest behaviors to avoid. Maybe they move out, that's fine. That's probably reducing their chances of becoming a murder victim. The decision still lies with them, but they should understand the things that put them at risk, and how to reduce it.\n\nOn the flip side, would you say that nobody should try to avoid becoming a victim?"}, {"id": "cnjntxb", "body": "&gt; But that doesn't mean the victim is without fault.

It is solely, only, entirely, and completely the agency of the criminal that caused, is at fault for, and is blameworthy that the crime occurred.\n\nAt best, one might, as has been discussed in this thread, be able to helpfully point out that a victim might be able to reduce their chances of being victimized by choosing different actions.\n\nBut as I've been saying all along, this is a lot harder than it looks.

The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take.

One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThis paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views \"cause\" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the \"cause\" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the \"cause,\" not your decision to enter an unsafe area.\n\nYou increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.\n\nMaybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think \"i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation,\" because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.\n\nA great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.  But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing.

Please stop treating me like an idiot if you can't bother to read what I've already written."}, {"id": "2rnfn0", "body": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

A person (unfortunately) is partly the cause of their own mugging if they are engaging in an activity that will make someone else more likely to mug them.  \n\nThey are not to blame, from a social perspective, but they are certainly part of the cause.

What I'm saying is that, IMO, we should analyze crimes that happen after the fact to determine what, if any, behaviours, situations, or choices tend to lead to victimization. We do this without assigning any fault to the victim for these choices. They don't even have to hear about the conclusions or be involved in the process if they don't want to (besides via the testimony they give, of course). We are simply trying to objectively determine which factors correspond to increased risk.

The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic.

You *can*, but you get that same hurt feeling as before, so you don't.\n\nIf we had not told you, you'd go and touch some other hot thing, and burn your hand again, being sure to avoid *that particular thing*.

If you were running, perhaps you didn't intuit that running makes it easier to get stabbed. Or perhaps I tell you a safer way to hold scissors (upside down, but the sharp part in your hand, with the handle up). That way of holding scissors reduces the problems while moving them around. Maybe you knew that. But I don't know if you do. I could also mention they are sharp, but you are old, so you should know that by now.

It just so happens that these commonly go hand in hand. As people who are focused on the objective causes are also less likely to sugarcoat things. For better or worse.\n\n&gt;Imagine yourself in a situation where say your child was murdered. Would it be helpful in any way for you to hear an officer in the hall saying to a reporter \"Well, the doors were unlocked.\"\n\nMakes sense. Probably what lead up to it happening too.\n\n&gt;It's only going to make your healing situation worse, and now you're going to be blaming yourself even more than you probably already were.\n\nBut I don't blame myself. That's the difference. Yes, I had a part in the event happening (leaving the kid alone, leaving the door unlocked), but I wasn't the initiator of the crime. I understand this to be the objective situation, regardless of how I feel. Pointing out facts doesn't hurt, it helps.\n\nTake when my house was broken into. I was distraught and worried about my stuff. But I appreciated when told \"be sure not to step over near the break in point or touch the door that was busted in, as there's footprints that can be recovered\" I made sure to follow that advice.\n\nWhen they said \"you should get a security system to prevent future break-ins\" I followed that advice as well. It's not that \"I didn't have a security system so I blame myself\" nope. It's just one thing that helped lead up to the event. And it's good to know.\n\nMore specifically I learned the security system itself doesn't matter. It's just the warning sign out from that does. Which means you can simply stick a sign out there and get the same security, rather than buying the system.\n\nAnother aftermath was \"should've seen it coming, the people who broke in (neighbors) had parents that scrape vin numbers from cars and sell them.\" It's a logical thing I didn't consider. Hell, I just figured the neighbors were friendly like the rest of them and that my dad was just a racist fuck.\n\nIt *also* gave me the knowledge of hiding my valuables *in my house*, when I leave for long periods of time, so if there *is* a break in, that stuff isn't stolen. This is something I didn't know until I actually was a victim. It's not victim blaming (I don't take it to be), but if I hid my stuff, it wouldn't have been stolen.\n\nLots of advice to help prevent future problems. And I see it that way.\n\n&gt;Whereas, say a year later and let's pretend you had two kids, your neighbor walked over and said to you, 'Yaknow, I heard about this great new alarm system.'\n\nA year? I'd rather the helpful info be provided immediately, like what I learned with the break-in. Didn't wait no year to get a security system. it was installed ASAP.\n\n&gt;but we have to be sensitive to the victim's needs as well (who the f cares about a door, a child is dead and justice needs to happen).\n\nPerhaps. But telling a person \"I'm praying for you\" or the equivalent is functionally useless. It gives them 0 information, and doesn't tell them anything they don't know. Whereas giving advice does.\n\n&gt; That insensitivity is why it's argued to be victim blaming, and I don't disagree with that.\n\nI agree. This is the main reason OP posted this thread. He thinks the discussion *should* be focused on that information, rather than simply being pointed out as victim blaming and promptly ignored. I agree with OP. While we shouldn't make the victim feel guilty, we should provide information to help prevent future problems.\n\n&gt;Basically, the at the time of the crime, the victim is incapable of looking at the situation objectively. So keep 'em out of it entirely at that time.\n\nI have no problem looking at events objectively during the time. Hell, that's *all* I can think about. Typically though it's not about past preventative actions, but what's going to happen in the future. Well shit I lost my stuff, what now? Track the guys, find them, call the police, get an alarm system to prevent future break ins, etc. Not \"waah I lost my stuff and I feel bad, so I can't think about anything\".\n\nPerhaps other people are different, but I like to focus on the helpful things, rather than the pointless ones.\n\n&gt;You may not intend to victim blame if you were to say \"Well, everyone knows that area is dangerous.\" Because it implies stupidity on the part of the victim.\n\nRight, the tone implies blaming the victim.\n\n&gt;Allowing the victim some time before we start talking about all the things they did wrong intentionally or unintentionally isn't necessarily a bad idea. But that is simply because it's hard for a person to talk about a crime without talking about the victim.\n\nI'd disagree here. I'd rather tackle the problem immediately, so it doesn't happen again. Yes, it was awful. No, I don't want it happening again and want to prevent it as much as I can. It seems you (and others) have the thought: yes, it was awful. No, I don't want to talk about how to prevent it in the future. Yes, I'll talk about it later (if I remember).\n\n&gt;In the end though, at the base we agree.\n\nDefinitely.

Mary gets mugged. You response is: \"Well why was she walking through that street at night? That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged.\"\n\nThe correct response is: \"Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime."}, {"id": "cnhm1uz", "body": "&gt; What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe?

I'm pretty sure everything went fine. I miscounted the fact that the company was paying for the hotel, but I needed to charge it on my card. This was a risk-assessment failure on my part.

Minimizing risk is the whole point.\n\n&gt;Do you think every single person who is attacked is just an idiot who isn't being cautious?\n\nMore or less. Either they didn't calculate the risks, or they lacked something in that calculation. Or perhaps they simply made a poor decision knowing the risk. Either way, they are either an idiot, or one who knew the risks and accepted them. Which is why informing them afterward is useful.\n\n&gt;Most people who are assaulted, raped, or murdered are victims of people they already know.\n\nYup, which reveals even *more* bad decision making. Why associate with people who would do that? Why keep yourself vulnerable to people who you don't know if they would do that or not? Sure, when you are younger, it makes sense to make these mistakes. I had a 'friend', who was great. But he ended up stealing from me. Looking back, it's obvious. He's a lier (which I knew, but was fine with), he came from a poor family, didn't clean up well, generally had a bad reputation,  etc. I should've known, but I didn't. Because I was a kid and wasn't told of this type of thing. I immediately broke off contact and was wary of similar individuals in the future.\n\nIn comparison, I had another poor friend, same type of situation, but he didn't steal at all, though I was careful about keeping an eye on him.

I kept him at a distance.\n\nPeople have too much trust, and not enough risk awareness.\n\n&gt;In many cases, people they have a reason to trust, like friends and close family.\n\nFamily can't be trusted. At least, mine can't. They've proven that to me time and time again. Friends I take on a case-by-case. Some friends I'd trust with my life. Others I wouldn't trust with the TV. Trusting people blindly is stupid. The friends I'd trust with my life have the same attitude towards me, and I've known them my entire life. I know how they think, I know how they behave, etc. I realize there's a risk of them backstabbing me, but that's incredibly low. Other friends I have a very low tolerance for, as I mentioned.\n\n&gt; But they aren't smart like you, so it's their fault. \n\nIt's not about being smart. It's about risk-management.\n\n&gt;Similarly, if you'd been attacked, you'd be crying that it was unfair and not your fault, but you're quick to assume everyone else is a complete dumbfuck who doesn't know how to tie his shoes, much less protect his safety.\n\nNope, I've had a history of being stolen from when I was younger. When I was pretty much powerless (can't move due to parents) and stupid (being a little kid). Both are definitely fair. I simply assumed nothing could go wrong. And that was stupid.

Never had a problem after that.\n\n&gt;Sorry bud, you can't answer a \"should we\" question with yes and no. We either do it or we don't.\n\nAs I said, my moral response is yes and no. It's not entirely her fault. But her living there definitely is part of the cause. The straight objective answer is \"yes\", but that doesn't reflect my thoughts on the matter entirely. It's a simplification used to straw man my views. In a morally grey world, nothing is black and white. Is it okay to kill a fat man in order to save 10 thin people? Yes and no is the answer. It just depends.\n\n&gt; If you aren't sure about your morals in this situation, don't try to debate about it.\n\nMy views are very clear. But \"should we all\" is not part of them. I don't think everyone should do the same thing. I also don't think telling Mary is an obligation. I also don't think Mary is the entire reason it happened. So it's a straw man. I *must* say yes and no, it encapsulates some of my view, and other parts don't.\n\nYes, Mary was part of the cause. Yes, Mary could've prevented it by acting differently. Yes, it's a good idea to tell Mary what she could do to prevent future acts. No, it's not entirely Mary who caused the event. \n\n&gt;Did your mother walk you home from the bus stop when you were 15? That would actually explain a lot.\n\nYes and no. Again, not a straight answer, because it can't be. Some days I caught a ride with my parents, other days I took the bus. I went to a small school my entire life. I knew the people who went on the bus. Actually though, at 15 I was in high school, so yes, since it's a far distance I got a ride with my Dad in the morning when he went to work.\n\nBut in general, what the fuck are you doing in an area that isn't safe alone when you are under 18? That's ignoring the risks, which is entirely what my point is. Both the parents being ignorant *and* the child. I *chose* to stay home when I was that age. Simply because I found it a better use of my time.\n\nI also used that time to skip ahead a few years, take college classes, as well as work as a college tutor. Again, focusing on risk management and planning goals.\n\nWhat would be stupid is to go hang out in bums park at that time. Again, why the fuck would I be there? Why would my parents *let me* go there? My parents have a low risk tolerance anyway, and are pretty cautious. I don't mind it, and actually have adopted a similar mindset because of it.\n\n&gt; No but seriously, most crimes occur in private places, so the crimes occurring in dark alleyways are what's minimal.\n\nDefinitely true.\n\n&gt;Your chance to be mugged is far, far lower than your chance not to be, no matter how dark the street.\n\nI'd argue that your chance to be mugged is dependent on how much time you spend around muggers. I'd imagine muggers mug each other a lot. When you hang around criminals, you'll be involved in crimes. Makes sense.\n\n&gt;You are, in essence, accusing people of not forseeing something incredibly unlikely. \n\nWalking down dark alleys is a bad idea anyway, muggers or not. Can't see where you are going, could be wild animals (which happens, I've seen coyotes, raccoons, etc), can get lost, might have picketpockets or muggers, etc. Though it really depends on the area too. \n\nI'm not accusing people of anything. I'm saying to look at the risks, and figure out what's safest, if that matters to you.\n\n&gt; I might as well ask why you visit your family on the holidays, since there's a statistic chance they'll rape and murder you.\n\nI typically don't. I also acknowledge that there's a good chance of domestic violence, rampant alcoholism and drinking, etc. I acknowledge these facts when I visit, and I visit typically because I enjoy (most of them anyway) their sober opinions on things. I don't typically like my Dad, but when he's sober he's pretty responsible, which I like. When he's drunk, I avoid him. My mom is chill mostly. Sober she's fun and has cool thoughts. Drunk she just complains a lot, nothing that bad. My siblings are fine. Most of them share a similar mindset than me, and if need be I can defend myself from them (haha).\n\nOther family I don't visit at all. And if my immediate family visits them (and I tag along) I treat them as strangers, not family.\n\nSo yes, I'm well aware of the risks and if something were to happen, I acknowledge I made a bad move and it's partly my fault I got into it.\n\n&gt;Not all risks can be avoided. \n\nRight, but they can be minimized. Though most of the time, the victim didn't minimize anything.\n\n&gt;What if there's no alternative but to go down the dark street to get home?\n\nThis implies you passed the street originally. When leaving the house, be sure to follow lit streets. Easy.\n\n&gt;Where I live, there are miles and miles of land with no streelights, and neighborhoods with several blocks that have no light at all. \n\nMove to an area that does. Easy.\n\n&gt;Not everyone is so fortunate as to be able to get rides everywhere, particularly poor people who can't afford the gas.\n\nI actually walk. I live in a well lit area, and one that is generally considered the safest city in the US. I chose it intentionally. The entire place is actually owned by one huge company, which the city is named after. So pretty much everything around is land owned by them, and there's security all over the place and well trusted workers. No problems.\n\n&gt;What if the mugger chooses Mary because a previous mark looked too intimidating?\n\nMy argument is on opportunistic crimes, not premeditated ones. Which is an entirely different story. If someone sees Mary in their yearbook, remembers her and wants to kill her. There's nothing Mary can do to minimize the risk. She *is* the target. The only thing to do would then be avoid her killer. Which she couldn't know about. In this case, you'd have a point.\n\nMy point (like OP) is to discuss rational and logical ways of minimizing risks that the victim could've done.\n\n&gt;if the mugger had no expenses, he wouldn't be out mugging people.\n\nTrue, and this is what we should focus on, why the mugger committed the crime."}, {"id": "cnhw7oc", "body": "&gt;Not even going to get into your sickening classism.\n\nIt's not classism, it's statistics. With the exception of children, poor people are poor because of bad decision making, poor money management, impulse acting, and other problems that go along with those.\n\n&gt;Not.\n\nNot? I'm pretty sure everything went fine. I miscounted the fact that the company was paying for the hotel, but I needed to charge it on my card. This was a risk-assessment failure on my part. But in the end, I managed to get things sorted out. If someone had told me this (or mentioned it after), I'd have known to prepare, and *know* to prepare for it next time. I know to be sure to check whether it's credit-card confirmed, whether the payment is going to me or if it's prepaid, etc.\n\n&gt;Everything went fine because you were lucky and the chance of being attacked is incredibly low, even in dangerous places.\n\nBut isn't (according to you) the reason people get attacked is because of dangerous people? You are contradicting yourself. I actually almost got scammed. But I used my brain, minimized risk, and turned down suspicious offers. Minimizing risk is the whole point.\n\n&gt;Do you think every single person who is attacked is just an idiot who isn't being cautious?\n\nMore or less. Either they didn't calculate the risks, or they lacked something in that calculation. Or perhaps they simply made a poor decision knowing the risk. Either way, they are either an idiot, or one who knew the risks and accepted them. Which is why informing them afterward is useful.\n\n&gt;Most people who are assaulted, raped, or murdered are victims of people they already know.\n\nYup, which reveals even *more* bad decision making. Why associate with people who would do that? Why keep yourself vulnerable to people who you don't know if they would do that or not? Sure, when you are younger, it makes sense to make these mistakes. I had a 'friend', who was great. But he ended up stealing from me. Looking back, it's obvious. He's a lier (which I knew, but was fine with), he came from a poor family, didn't clean up well, generally had a bad reputation,  etc. I should've known, but I didn't. Because I was a kid and wasn't told of this type of thing. I immediately broke off contact and was wary of similar individuals in the future.\n\nIn comparison, I had another poor friend, same type of situation, but he didn't steal at all, though I was careful about keeping an eye on him. He turned out to not be that great of a friend, but he was okay. I kept him at a distance.\n\nPeople have too much trust, and not enough risk awareness.\n\n&gt;In many cases, people they have a reason to trust, like friends and close family.\n\nFamily can't be trusted. At least, mine can't. They've proven that to me time and time again. Friends I take on a case-by-case. Some friends I'd trust with my life. Others I wouldn't trust with the TV. Trusting people blindly is stupid. The friends I'd trust with my life have the same attitude towards me, and I've known them my entire life. I know how they think, I know how they behave, etc. I realize there's a risk of them backstabbing me, but that's incredibly low.

You response is: \"Well why was she walking through that street at night? That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged.\"\n\nThe correct response is: \"Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic.

The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime."}, {"id": "cnhmitt", "body": "I think it's the difference between acknowledging current realities while maintaining long term goals.\n\nWe should aspire to rid society of crime and we shouldn't accept it as a fact of life.
