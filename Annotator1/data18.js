He cancelled class one day about half-way through because he had just made a decision that resulted in the inevitable death of a 12 year old girl. He wouldn't share the details, just that he couldn't teach because he was struggling with having killed this kid because it was the hard logical output of his moral reasoning and he had presented a compelling case to the ethics board. \n\nThe university was a research hospital, so I'm not sure how much his decision changed any outcomes, but it certainly had impacted him. He noted later that he never made a decision about someone's case without meeting them and their family first. I can't even begin to imagine how hard that must be. \n\nIn any case, just because you don't share the assumptions of an interlocutor does not mean that their reasoning violates any rules of logic.  Indeed, one of the irritating things about the Catholic church's position on abortion, for example, is that it is a required conclusion from other, more fundamental assumptions of Catholic theology. Now, you may not believe in God and you may not share those assumptions, but the framework that produces that outcome is logically consistent. It is 'reasonable.'\n\nNow, that said, many people who are part of various communities that have well reasoned arguments for a moral position that falls out of a strongly supported moral framework don't know the logic and can't present the reasoned argument. But that's really not the same thing as there not being a well reasoned argument in the first place. \n\nI can't design a circuit board, but that doesn't mean I don't know how to use a computer. Likewise, someone not being a trained moral philosopher doesn't mean that they should do whatever they want without consideration of the moral implications. Indeed, if someone isn't trained in ethics and moral philosophy, that's all the more reason to accept the teachings of someone who is part of your community who is so trained. \n\n"}, {"id": "2r3lm3", "body": "... or to put it another way, I suppose it could be written that \"People hold many opinions about the immoral nature of certain actions *just because* with no real logical reason for it.\"\n\nThis is an opinion I've been trying to quantify for a while now, and my time on CMV has only seemed to reinforce this view.

That's fair. But the reality is that human lives are **intertwined**. Harm to one can harm another, perhaps at a later time.\n\nFor example, letting yourself get addicted to drugs might lead you to become a burden on the medical and legal system. Also, if you become addicted after you finish school and college, then society has invested a lot of time and effort into you - if you then fail to become a productive member of society, or worse, then you have taken a lot but are returning nothing, or negative value.\n\nTo take it to an extreme, if everyone took drugs all the time and felt great, but did little productive stuff like keep the economy going, then society would collapse. **Civilization has a responsibility to avoid that.** Yes, it can infringe on our personal freedom at times. Yes, that can be justified.\n\nOf course, in other cases it isn't.

If the drugs were not part of the picture, if the person was not an addict, they would not be committing the other crimes.

People posting everything from views about the morality of drugs, to homosexuality, etc... and so little of morality seems to make sense. There are taboos against drug use, against incest, against homosexuality, against open sexuality, against so many things. There's this kind of *\"moral disgust\"* for things which don't inherently do any harm. Most of the explanations I see for why these things are wrong are generic answers with little thought or reason to them: \"It's unnatural\", \"It's an affront to god\", \"It just isn't, because it just isn't\". \n\n***As far as I believe morality should be concerned, we should be allowed to do whatever we want with our own bodies so long as nobody else is harmed.***\n\nIf you want to do drugs just because the high makes you happy, and you've been educated and warned about the potential damages to your own body... it is your body and your life, what is wrong? If you're gay and you choose to have consensual homosexual sex and that's what you both decide to do with your bodies, what is wrong? If you want to post nudes online and you feel empowered from it and the comments you get, what is wrong? \n\nThe only explanation I could honestly come up with is the way others may react to you, but even that is just a biproduct of a culture which creates senseless taboos, and does things like shaming people for being \"sluts\" or for being gay without any real justification.\n\nWhat sense is there in these taboos, and the kind of bullying and shame that often comes with them?

My answer is yes and no. In the case of someone having an earnest discussion about religion and the lack thereof, as I mentioned above that is fine. At the point where you're trying to force people to do things they otherwise wouldn't or strip their rights, however, that's a big issue. And that's where the gap between faith and faithlessness comes in. Every atheist I'm aware of is atheist because they're very open minded, very intelligent, very progressive. They believe that organized faith has created dogma that tries to control lives, there isn't enough logical evidence for god, and that god has become a distraction from real issues. They're for gay rights, women's rights, human rights. Many religious people are too, and I've had many an interesting discussion with honest open minded religious people. The trouble is the far right, the conservative religious who try to oppose gay marriage, who opposed the civil rights movement and women's rights movement, and who are so bigoted in their ways that they try to force themselves on others and take their rights away. That is wrong. "}, {"id": "cnc4trn", "body": "I agree with everything you said. Quick question (admittedly off topic) do you think it is moral for atheists to try and convert religious people? Do you think it's not, for the reasons outlined?"}, {"id": "cncpn3h", "body": "As an agnostic, I won't speak to the \"morality\" of pushing your view system on someone else (as you have pointed out that is highly subjective), but I believe it to usually have a negative effect regardless of intent. People are more receptive to new perspectives when they can explore them on their own terms. I have a hard time trying to think of any situation where I can have a positive or receptive attitude to an adult, especially a stranger, giving uninvited opinions on how I live my life. I was raised in a very religious home so I do understand that people who try to do so are acting out of their perceived moral concern for my soul, and I know they don't mean to offend.\n\n\n HOWEVER - matters of belief are very personal and private to a lot of people, even people who are atheist or who otherwise do not seem to subscribe to a particular faith, and as such can be an uncomfortable topic. Basic social awareness has led me to conclude that it's not polite at all to force uncomfortable topics on anyone but a few close friends who know each other well enough to discuss heavier topics. Basic social awareness also leads me to conclude that when my social activity starts to make people uncomfortable (by say, bringing up controversial or inappropriate conversation topics in a poor setting or context, ignoring signs that someone else is not welcoming to that conversation, etc), that it can and will actually cause an effect of pushing people away, by either leading my friends to spend less and less time with me or by leaving a bad first impression on new acquaintances who then choose not to become a friend in the future.\n\nSo - if you've followed me so far, the problem with forcing personal discussions like religious beliefs/lack of religious beliefs on people is that even IF you do truly only have the purest, best intentions, it is highly likely you will just come off as a pretentious dick who thinks for some reason he gets to tell someone else how to live his or her life. Doesn't matter if you are selling religion or atheism, whether you care about the person or you're just mad. Imagine how you would feel (I assume you are quite secure and fulfilled in your current belief system to feel moved to convert people) if someone from another religion (the more antagonistic to your current beliefs, the better for this example) tried to convert you. You might feel angry, annoyed, probably even insulted at the presumtuousness of another person to suggest their beliefs are more valid than your own. At best, you might patiently sit through the person's spiel just to be polite, while mentally you've already shut it out, either saddened or amused by his/her ignorance. You will almost never gain anyone's respect or attention through that approach.\n\nThere are still respectful ways to have meaningful discussions about spiritual matters between people with differing belief systems. In my case, my husband and I have several close friends with different religious backgrounds who will ocassionally find ourselves having a political or religious discussion over beer. As long as none of us start trying to convert one another, it can be very fascinating to learn new things about other belief and culture systems, and in that context we are much more likely to listen, ask questions, and reflect on what we talked about.\n\nTL;DR - Out of basic adult social awareness, I believe the personal beliefs of others are none of my business and not open for discussion unless the individual in question indicates otherwise. I also believe that if I for some reason choose to discuss such subjects anyway and the person acts like I am intruding, well, I asked for it. Otherwise I don't go out of my way to talk people out of their beliefs and hope they do the same for me in return. \n\n"}, {"id": "2r3fa4", "body": "The reasons for this are different depending on whether you are religious or not.

I'm very familiar with world religions, modern and ancient, philosophy in general, and contemporary movements. I try to stay current.\n\nIf you marry these old noble covenantal trust cults (\"I still believe in you, trustworthy God!\") to Roman politics (\"worship Caesar or I'll stick this gladius in your neck\") you get philosophy cults (\"Accept God's love or else.\").\n\nEvangelism comes from first coercing (\"convert or we'll kill you\"), and later warning non-believers about God's tendency to kill political enemies, thus saving them from his wrath. This is a tactic used by the mafia known as [racketeering.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_%28crime%29) So, first of all, the idea that God is providing a service to save you from himself is evil in concept, and used lucratively by evil people in ~~The Holy Roman Empire and her [state church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church)~~ organized crime.\n\nOn an individual level, conversion is immoral because it's based on faith, which literally means \"trust\". It's morally wrong to ask people to trust vicariously, especially when you're also trusting vicariously. Imagine if I said, \"Trust Jeff.\" because somebody told me to. You'd say something like, \"No.\" Because you don't know Jeff, and I have no right to ask you to do that, because boundaries exist and trust is personal and not something you just do wantonly.\n\nTrust, if not exclusive and based on trustworthiness, is called naivete. It's wrong to ask other people to be deliberately naive, because it's like asking them to look the other way for so-and-so, which is another idea popular in crime.\n\nMoreover, evangelizing is immoral in particular because, when you witness, you're attesting not to what you saw (or, witnessed), but to what somebody else says that somebody else says they saw, under the guise that you're sure the event occurred. You're literally vouching for something you haven't yourself verified, and ensuring that others should (if not must) stake their lives on it too. That's really dirty. \n\nAlso, that the hearer even *must* be absolutely sure too, or else Jesus/Mohammad will murder them forever--or look the other way while they're murdered forever, or whatever. Such stories are really bad obviously, but the worst part is that you're telling them and being convicted of them, and insisting on them *when you don't know that they're true*.\n\nTo quote one of the only things said to have been written in stone, literally the only things that would be binding in an ancient covenant:\n\n\"Do not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\""}, {"id": "2r3fa4", "body": "The reasons for this are different depending on whether you are religious or not.

For example: 'That's so gay' and 'You throw like a girl' type insults. Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic, but I don't believe that's necessarily the case at all.\n\nI think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesn't think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks they're inferior, but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away.\n\nWomen in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because that's manly. But they probably don't hate men.\n\nSimilarly, being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic, but because they are being called something they are not.\n\nI think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are mis-gendered (Purposely). It is a deliberate refusal of their identity. No one says a trans woman is a misandrist if she hates being referred to as 'he'. The people calling them 'he' are also unlikely to hate men, but say it to hurt the trans person. \n\nSo CMV, insults such as those above aren't necessarily homophobic or misogynist. They sting because they are an affront to identity more so than because being gay or a woman is a bad thing.\n\n_____\n\n"}, {"id": "cnc2apj", "body": "You're correct that saying \"you're gay\" is not necessarily insulting to gay people.

I'm 24 and have used that term since childhood to display mild annoyance at something. Since my teens, and with a larger use of the internet, I have used the word \"faggot\" to express a stronger disdain for something or a joke towards someone I felt was acting like an idiot. Both of these words have become so far removed from their original meaning in my mind (and I'm willing to bet for other people) that they only retain the meaning of \"something that is bad\". While, yes, you could attach the \"something that is bad\" to homosexuals via mental connotation but the reality is that it's only ever when the subject OP has raised comes up that I ever think about it in those terms. \n\nI understand that it's a hurtful word to some people but honestly that doesn't change my stance of using it to describe objects or people. It's intent that is important - much in the same way as someone calling me a \"Scottish bastard\" would be important if they did it with malice. My English friend calls me a \"jock cunt\" and a \"faggot\" all the time but it doesn't even slightly offend me, and I've called him a  \"faggot\" and a \"northern monkey\". \n\nI tried to refrain from mentioning that he is bisexual but it's pertinent. However much the \"my best friends are gay/black/disabled/mentally ill\" example is used it doesn't stop it from being true and relevant *sometimes*. So here we have a person who has had sexual intercourse with men in the past who can not only use the word \"faggot\" (and more to the point the word \"gay\") but also hear it said towards him without taking offense because the intent is not to comment on his sexuality but to use the word in the more meaningful (to use at least) \"internet context\". \n\nTo that end I *would* be more hesitant to use \"faggot\" in real life because a larger proportion of the population has not been on the internet and would take it to mean what it originally did - my argument is that the words \"gay\" and \"faggot\" have different meanings now, to those with the \"right intent\" i.e. people who don't hold the LGB community as a lower class of citizen. \n\nFrankly I welcome the fact that both of these words have become less barbed in their use. Using them both as a replacement for \"bad\" is far less destructive than using them to convey your complete distaste for gay people. Hopefully, the same will happen with the word \"nigger\" but that's a long way off."}, {"id": "cnd8tum", "body": "How are gay people around you supposed to tell the difference between innocent you and not-innocent homophobes when you both use them as insults in the same way despite the intent behind being different? \n\nWe aren't mind readers.

Its not an insult to gay people so. \n\nWhen you get offended by 'You're cheap like a Jew' the negative aspects of 'cheap' are what offend you, not the Jew part right? You are insulted by the negative stereotypes more so than being called a Jew. Why be offended about being called a Jew?\n\nI'm quite sure the generalizations about women wanting taller partners is very true. The facial hair one is not as rooted in fact, I'll give you that. I still think it makes sense though."}, {"id": "cnc374y", "body": "What about when Jews say it?"}, {"id": "cnc374y", "body": "What about when Jews say it?"}, {"id": "cnc38ms", "body": "I don't think any of this offensive, but I can understand if some people get offended.

For example: 'That's so gay' and 'You throw like a girl' type insults. Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic, but I don't believe that's necessarily the case at all.\n\nI think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesn't think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks they're inferior, but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away.\n\nWomen in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because that's manly. But they probably don't hate men.\n\nSimilarly, being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic, but because they are being called something they are not.\n\nI think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are mis-gendered (Purposely). It is a deliberate refusal of their identity. No one says a trans woman is a misandrist if she hates being referred to as 'he'. The people calling them 'he' are also unlikely to hate men, but say it to hurt the trans person. \n\nSo CMV, insults such as those above aren't necessarily homophobic or misogynist. They sting because they are an affront to identity more so than because being gay or a woman is a bad thing.\n\n_____\n\n"}, {"id": "cnc34dn", "body": "Dude, come on.

Examples of misogyny and discrimination don't have to be ignored or excused (as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do) because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy, nor institutional misogyny.

They are different things arrived at differently which are often mutually exclusive. That seems to be almost the definition of a dichotomy. \n\n&gt; it is difficult to assign numeric values that touch upon the issues in that field in any meaningful sense.\n\nI don't really follow you up to this point but this I can address. Oppression is, by it's very nature, not subtle. Things that are not subtle can generally be quantified. When a claim is made that  group x is living under oppression, quantitative facts SHOULD be able to expose the truth of the claim. We can think of many examples. Apartheid in South Africa, for example. Now, when the numbers don't paint a picture of oppression and when they, in fact, refute the claim (such as the wage gap), then it becomes disingenuous to continue to claim that oppression exists. Basically, if we lived in a patriarchy, there should be a quantifiable residue and those numbers SHOULD agree with that conclusion. \n\nNow, there are many attempts to manufacture such numbers (the link I provided above) but they don't ever seem to stand up to much scrutiny. On the other hand, it's not hard to find highly vocal people, even or especially within academia, with a highly vested interest to demonstrate that such a system exists, regardless of the truth of the matter. \n\nThis sort of thing may actually do a great deal of harm in that it causes people to falsely view themselves as victims and causes society to uselessly expend resources.

You agree with h76CH36, but attempt to add your own spin on it.  That is, that the system is intentionally targeting or unfair to minorites, despite the inclusion of widespread unfairness to the members of the supposed priviliged class.  It seemed to me while you agreed that the current focus (of the view you were defending), was wrong, you then proceeded to take that as evidence your theory was even more correct, rather than less (not trying to saying they are completely incompatible for the record).\n\nPeople can define anything in terms of almost whatever position they wish.  Look at conspiricay theories, revisionist histories, heck we even see this in the sciences.  Newton physics works on certain levels and only has problems when you go to extreme micro or macro levels.  It took a paradigm shift to make scientists realize that they were approaching the problem wrong (their work still is makes sense, and a lot is still useful. It just wasn't the explanations to the universe they originally believed.  Those relationships, theories and equations, are still observably true, despite the fact they still missed the larger point).  I think that is the main source of fustration with feminism and patriarchy advocates.  They may not be completely wrong, but they still manage to miss the large picture because they are singularly focused on what they are assuming the problem to be.\n\nSo while you can argue that we can define problems, or at least understand certain problems, in terms of patriarchy.... if the solutions implied by that view don't help toward fixing the problem, why should we?  Especially if the vagueness (which you admit is necessarily in place) means you miss a lot of information on the margins. Furthermore bearing in mind that a clearer, more effective approach might be to view the problems from the standpoint an oligarchy.  Women and other minority groups have been gaining more and more rights based on egalitarian concerns, rather than being a product of the newer ideas of patriarchy or new feminist ideologies, so I don't see why we need to hold on to those explaination for there own sake when other alternatives seem better and can and have lead to the increasing franchisement for those groups.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnbx8z6", "body": "patriarchy isn't as simple of a concept as 'Men have the power' or even 'People who have power are men.' \n\nit's a term that is used to define, in a general sense, what you have mentioned above as well as the broad and often contentious set of cultural and social norms/practices that fosters, reinforces and indoctrinates individuals into a gender binary in which men are dominant. thanks to the only decades old social revolutions of the 20th century, women can now vote and own property in many places. this however, does not mean that patriarchy is nonexistent or any less potent. cultural norms and corresponding psychological attitudes and behaviors are still problematic and even more so due to their subtle and often unconscious nature.\n\nChivalry is a good example of patriarchy.

Why do you think that is?\n\nI'm gonna answer these two as one. While the mean IQ for men and women are essentially the same, [males have a higher variance](http://www.mwilliams.info/archive/2011/01/unemployment-technology-iq-and-gender.php). Generally, [IQ correlates with salary](http://www.highiqpro.com/iq-academic-success/academic-achievement-income-iq) (a mark of the prestige/quality of a job). This means that while there should be more women at the middle of the job spectrum, there should be more men at the low and high ends of the job spectrum, which there are. That is a great reason why more men work as CEOs and politicians, as well as the low-end jobs I answered earlier.\n\n&gt;Its not that black and white. I would say there are more people who dont care about gender equality than people who do care about it.

That's kind of my point, it's not that black and white that the government is contributing to a patriarchy, which you said was \"undisputably\" true. Under your definition of having more male politicians and CEOs, we do live in a patriarchy. Not many people agree with that definition at all though, including me.\n\n&gt;So you think in places like afghanistan women drive all the trucks and mine all the coal?\n\nI answered this in my previous answer, men are biologically more represented at the low end of the IQ spectrum.

Suppose you want to go earlier than high school if you think cultural norms have already influence children by then. [After just 26 weeks of pregnancy](http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/how-male-female-brains-differ), there are shown to be biological differences that suggest women interpret language differently than men, which transfer to later in life. This is evidence that brains themselves form differently based on gender.\n\nI'm going to skip the politician's one because it's quite a bit tougher to come up with evidence for that for a number of reasons.\n\nMore women want to be healthcare providers in part due to cultural norms but I do think greatly due to biological norms. I couldn't find a very reputable source for it at this time but while the mean IQ for men and women are similar, the standard deviation is higher for men, and the distribution looks roughly like [this](http://www.mwilliams.info/archive/2011/01/unemployment-technology-iq-and-gender.php). Medical degrees require dedication and/or ability to acquire vast amounts of knowledge, which can be indicated by IQ. It therefore makes sense that men are more greatly represented as doctors/dentists/chiropractors etc. Therefore the men who are interested in healthcare would be less likely to 'settle' for nursing. Additionally there could be some biological reasons from previous gender roles why women are more interested in nursing, but this is more me thinking of the top of my head. The female body is partly designed to nurture babies. Thus, this could extend to the healthcare field for women who like to nurture.\n\nPoliticians are the toughest to actually prove or find evidence for. I can use my previous argument that society isn't really discouraging women from being a congressperson because they are winning the primaries at approximately the same rate as men. It may have been the case that previously that women were discouraged from entering politics, and because [the average age of congresspeople is 57 years](http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%260BL%2BR%5CC%3F%0A), it may take a while for women to 'catch up' and be more open to entering congressional office.\n\nBecause there are biological differences that affect jobs in engineering and healthcare, it would make logical sense that it would carry over to any job, based on the requirements of how the job requires you to think. \n\nI'll read through your documents and see what I try to figure out, but I also want to go to bed, so we'll see."}, {"id": "cnbsyq7", "body": "Before you do, I would like to pre-empt and ask you to provide an explanation for the following:  \n\n---\n\n1) In Malaysia, there is roughly a 50/50 split male/female in CS and tech jobs.

Why does this continue to happen across the globe in well off, 1st world countries - even incredibly progressive ones such as Sweden and Norway? Are you prepared to right off the inclusion of biology - at any level - as a possible answer?\n\nAnd remember, with India, I.T is one of it's leading economies, and as such is a way for people to make good money.

When people criticize feminism the first answer is always *\"what you talk about is not feminism, look up the definition of feminism in a dictionary\"*.
