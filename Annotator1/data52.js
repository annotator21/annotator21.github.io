Ironed sheets give you an additional 10% tidiness.\n * Women like neat guys. There, I said it. A guy who has ironed sheets clearly has his shit together and is worthy of having wild sex with (I'm guessing/ hoping that's how it is).

Unless you have a way to preserve consciousness that requires zero energy transfer, then the only thing you can fall back on is quantum fluctuations spontaneously providing the energy needed.

Perhaps a big bang is an inevitability given empty space and time, so that the universe itself operates in a cycle. In order to 'survive' across these cycles, it would be necessary to preserve order (i.e. consciousness) for an arbitrary time in heat death (physically impossible).

I would challenge that part of your view.\n\nHowever, it does seem possible that at least some scenarios could allow survival. \n\nOne is the creation of another universe that we could somehow transfer ourselves into. We don't currently understand how universes come to be, so this seems implausible today, but we have billions of years to figure it out. \n\nAnother is that quantum mechanics might possibly make it impossible for the universe to *actually* achieve perfect heat-death. It might be the case that there is always a fluctuating quantum field that can be used as a minute energy source. A sufficiently clever species might find a way to spread their consciousness over a sufficiently large area that this minute amount of energy could sustain them.\n\nAnother is that we *really* don't understand anything about the missing majority of the universe we're currently calling Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We don't know what laws they follow, we don't really know anything about them, or even for certain know that they exist (they are basically just an argument from ignorance at present). Something about one or both of these might allow survival somehow.\n\nAll of these, though (and, I believe, any other way that humans could survive heat death), rely on physics that we don't understand well enough today to say that we know it's possible. \n\nBy the physics we know today, it's impossible. You can't have a perfect perpetual motion machine, and so anything you devise will eventually run down. \n\nPositing that something will stop the heat death of the universe in time to survive is not really \"surviving the heat death of the universe\", it's saying that you think there won't ever *be* a \"heat death of the universe\".

Our species is the driving force behind a massive extinction event that rivals the one that killed the dinosaurs. We burn down rain forests that contain millions of species which can only live there. We scrape 500,000,000 pounds of marine life off the ocean floor every year, including miles and miles of unique coral reef ecosystems. Oh, and global warming? We dammed up all the rivers in the world, and redirected the water to cities and suburbia! Did you think that would cool the planet down? No!

I'd argue that just because we can create something doesn't mean we can destroy it.\n\nThe lowest-hanging fruit for me to point out would be a human child. You can create it, but can you kill it?\n\nBut the problem with that is that you'd have to equate a human life to a bull's life in order for that argument to work. Let's instead argue about different degrees of importance in humans, and then extend the idea to other animals. \n\nSay, you have the President of the US. He's obviously very important, right? Should he be allowed to kill, for fun, a bum on the street who is obviously not important, not valuable to society, and not doing anything particularly productive? By cold logic, that would probably decrease the strain on society.\n\nI'd imagine that your argument is 'no.' But why? Is it because the bum *can* do something valuable? Is it because he *has* done something valuable? Is it because he *will* do something valuable? When you strip all the bullshit excuses away, every argument will boil down to \"because he has a right to live.\" \n\nBut why does he have a right to live? Again, that right isn't about what someone *can* do, or *should* do, or *will* do. It's just about him being alive and wanting that life to continue, and that nobody should have the right to up and take that from him, no matter how much more 'valuable' that other person is in comparison to the bum.\n\nSo extend that idea to a bull. The bull is alive; it wants to continue to be alive, as is made obvious by the fact that it's literally fighting for its life in a bullfight. It's not doing that to put on a show, it's doing that because it wants to not die.\n\nAt this point, people regularly cry \"anthropomorphism!\" That's horseshit. Animals are completely capable of having emotion, as any pet owner will tell you. \n\nSo, you have a point of comparison: Regardless of what that animal is *capable* of doing in our society, regardless of whether it *can* do something or *will* do something 'valuable,' at the core of the issue you have a person snuffing out a life that actively wants to not be ended.\n\nAnd for what? Not to protect the life of the killer; while yes, the bull is trying to kill the bullfighter, that's only because of a set of steps taken by humans to force the bull to try to kill the bullfighter. Not for food or leather or anything that the bullfighter needs to better his life; he's actually putting himself in danger for what is essentially nothing that the bull can give him. \n\nYou're killing the bull for entertainment, and for no other reason. Despite all the many, many ways you can entertain yourself in today's society, participants in blood sports like bullfighting are ending the life of another creature, a creature that wants to live. They're doing it for no benefit to themselves. \n\nSo let's apply the 'golden rule' here. How would *you* feel if I came up and killed, say, your wife or child? Not because I needed anything from them, not because they were any more or less important than me, but simply because I was bored? You'd label me a sociopath and haul me off to jail, if you didn't kill me in revenge. But it's the same thing--the taking of a life for entertainment. All of the rest of those details--value, species, need--are irrelevant when the motivation is boredom.

However, the key to this is the fact that all of the drugs are used in a controlled environment, with trained therapists and following a strict therapeutic paradigm. \n\nThere is absolutely no evidence, however, that using drugs recreationally makes you any more intelligent, or is even useful to self-medicate (self-medication with drugs can be incredibly problematic). As a recreational drug user myself I get extremely frustrated when I see other users throwing out wild claims like this: it undermines the legitimate arguments surrounding drugs which are based on evidence and fact, and is also downright irresponsible and dangerous. Educating young people objectively about drugs, so that they can make informed decisions, and use them safely, if they so decide, is vital. Making unjustified claims that recreational drugs are somehow a cure-all for life's problems or a shortcut to intelligence is the antithesis of this. Evidence should be the key to guiding both government policy and individual decision-making: lack of evidence is my main criticism of the anti-legalisation lobby, but the argument can easily be adapted here.\n\nI'm not denying the fact that drugs, when used sensibly and very occasionally in a recreational setting, can have positive influence on your life: for me, this positivity comes from the shared experiences with friends and family."}, {"id": "2q26yn", "body": "I'm not saying that if you smoke a bunch of pot or mix all these drugs together, it will necessarily make you smarter.

I'm sure if you gave her a choice between waffle crisp and the substi o's she would take the gluten free option.  Someone who is lactose intolerant may well choose to eat their cereal without milk or with a milk substitute to avoid the discomfort that would follow.\n\nYou are arguing that because **you** prefer Resse's everyone else should hold the same opinion.  Even if we take allergies out of the picture, everyone has different tastes and preferences.  My favorite food is brussel sprouts but I don't try to tell everyone else that they are better than pizza or falafel.  We literally have different taste buds and that makes it so we perceive foods differently.  \n\nTo address the second point, it's just a matter of waiting for the milk to soak into the cereal to improve the texture.  And again, much of this is a matter of personal preference.  Some people like crispy cereal and some like it soggy.  There is no objective better when it comes to food.  \n\n\nThirdly the insanity caused in birds and small children is directly related to how much they enjoy the cereal.  Coco Puffs are so good that people are absolutely desperate to get their hands on some. \n\nLastly in your closing statement you advocate that your mother and everyone else should bye Reese's the next time we go to the store.  I have no arguments against your mother getting them but buying them myself is absolutely useless. I can't eat them and I don't have guests over so the box would just sit there taking up space and wasting my money.  \n\n"}, {"id": "2q1xmv", "body": "The chocolate cereal known as coco puffs is obsolete to reese's puffs.

Im just saying that we're getting perpetually more intelligent.\n\nExcept we aren't actually, there is no mechanism for this to occur really. We are aggregating knowledge very quickly as a whole species, but there's [speculation that individually we're actually getting less intelligent since the time of ancient philosophers](http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/nov/12/pampered-humanity-less-intelligent). \n\n&gt; Do you realise you just said that improving our intelligence doesnt increase our abilities? we can do things today that would be considered impossible in the past, because of our increased understanding of the world.\n\nYes, I do realize what I said, and let me explain. Supposing even that our intelligence increases perpetually over time, we're still bound by the finite limitations of our bodies or whatever mechanical augmentations we may choose to add. A computer gains more transistors over time as following in accordance with Moore's Law, which does make it faster and able to process more, but the fundamental limits of what it can do are still tied to reality. It is still just a series of switches flicking on and off to run binary maths calculations. Likewise, human beings are made up of cells. Though we may get larger brains, or generally become more intelligent, we're limited in capacity by the fundamental processes of an organic body. Maybe in the future we'll all be able to plug 3D printers into our arms via USB 5.0, but that doesn't mean we're \"Gods\". We won't suddenly be able to conjure up planets and universes at will as a \"God\" would, because we are still working within the confines of the laws of our reality. \n\n&gt; Intelligence is the ability to understand the truth, thats a comprehensive definition for sentient beings. What would be another form of intelligence?\n\nI think this is a very limited view of the world, but this is a [debate that has been going on in science and philosophy for millennia](http://bigthink.com/going-mental/what-is-intelligence-2). It's like some people say \"I don't have book smarts, I have street smarts\". And credit to them, they often do. Intelligence is an invented quantity to describe how optimized something is to perform certain tasks. As described in the above video on Hill Climbing Algorithms and AI, Evolution is a dumb process because it works entirely by random chance by testing in the real world. We could be described as relatively much more intelligent because we are imaginative enough to be able to simulate in our minds the potential results of a test before making it in the real world, accomplishing in an afternoon what evolution could not in a 100,000 years. Our form of intelligence seems to be about manipulating tools to our advantage. It is our ability to imagine and create which has let us take over the world. The only problem is, that's not the point of \"life\" as a function of nature. Life itself only cares about survival. Living organisms are a collection of atoms arranged into cells, arranged into organs, arranged into structure organ systems, all of which work in unison to create autonomous entity and to try and continue \"being\". That in itself is very intelligent. Those creatures, for the most part, only care about eating, drinking, and reproducing, because those are the basic instincts of any living being we can currently conceive. If you watch documentaries, though, you'll see how nature is full of intelligent creatures. Animals can be trained to speak in sign language, they can be shown to make complex calculations, they can be shown to have empathy for one another... our dominance of societal and technological principles does not imply that we are the best branch of evolution.\n\n&gt; Its not really for you to say whether people having spiritual experiences are discovering something that does exist or inventing something that doesnt.\n\nThe lack of any empirical proof for any of it does tend to imply that. To quote Tim Minchin here; \"Every mystery, ever solved, has turned out to be, NOT MAGIC\".\n\nOur brains are full of functions which work against an objective understanding of reality.

So ya, if they are advanced enough to know things we don't and have technology we don't, it might seem to humans like these beings are \"magic\" or \"supernatural\", and therefor qualify as gods. But the problem is that we already know that technology exists, and we, as an imaginative species, envision beings more powerful than us.... but they still are **not** magic or supernatural.

Because a perfect mix of resources, environmental conditions, and competition have to exist to leadevolution down any specific path.

But you could also make the same thing using gas extraction from the atmosphere powered by wind turbines, sustainable; that is not allowed.  Potassium waste from smelting that would go to a land-fill, is used in regular farming for it's potassium source; it keeps it out of a land fill and is less CO2 intensive than mining.  Waste potassium is banned in organic farming.  There are also programs working on extracting potassium from seawater, which is were it goes after people pee it out; that too is banned from organic farming, even if it only uses 100% renewable power.\n\nedit: spelling"}, {"id": "cn235e3", "body": "Interesting perspective.

Yes an organic farm *can* be more sustainable or it *can* be less sustainable, organic is just a set of arbitrary practices\n\nHe's some other things organic food proponents like to clam:\n\n * Organic farming doesn't use pesticides.  Actually Organic farming doesn't use **synthetic** pesticides, there are a lot of plant and basic chemical pesticides that they do use.\n\n * Organic food contains less pesticides.  Actually there is no correlation to organic food and lower pesticide residue on food.  The trace amounts of pesticide present on food is a result of the handling practices, the situation at the time of harvest, and historical pesticide use.  Some of those old long lasting pesticides are still present in the fields, you can find US grown fruits and vegetables that have trace levels of pesticide that has been banned for 20 years.\n\n * Organic food is made by smaller farmers not corporations.  Corporations jumped on the organic farming train from the get go, the vast majority of organic food comes from the **exact same** companies the use traditional agriculture.  In some cases the organic practices are industry standard for some crops, so things like spinach might come from the same organic field and they just placed it in two separate bags to get both the regular and organic customers.\n\n * Organic food doesn't contain GMO.  Only direct gene injection is not allowed withing organic food.  Things like irradiating plants or exposing them to carcinogens to create new mutant strains are perfectly fine.  The reason being that some crops like wheat already had this done to almost all the major gene lines.

If it were, factory organic farms would have better yields. Lucky for us there are a number of different certifications, from 100% organic (which is probably a [terrible](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/2011/07/18/mythbusting-101-organic-farming-conventional-agriculture/) way to farm for sustainability reasons) to \"made with organic ingredients.\" Unfortunately, most of the people spending 300 bucks a week for two people at Whole Foods have no idea what the labels *actually mean* from a practical standpoint.\n\n&gt;This is a weird rule and prevents them from using seeds with Bt traits (Bt is a pesticide used by more than 50% of organic farmers) that would help them reduce the amount of chemicals they use.\n\nMonsanto's Bt corn is [broken](http://www.wired.com/2014/03/rootworm-resistance-bt-corn/). The corn rootworm has developed an immunity to it, so farmers using Bt corn are increasing pesticide input to former, pre-GMO levels. The EPA initially recommended that farmers keep a full 50% of their fields planted with non-GMO seed in order to encourage mating between Bt-resistant and non-Bt-resistant pests, but many of these guidelines were not followed and were resisted by Monsanto. The use of GMO rapidly increased resistance to the pesticide because farmers planted corn continuously rather than rotating with soybean. As the article points out, continuous corn is a great place for the corn rootworm to develop resistance at an accelerated rate through normal evolutionary processes.\n\n&gt;The only reason against this I could see is that organic is now a marketing label, not just a type of farming regulation.\n\nNo, the reason against it is that organic has a very specific legal definition. You cannot certify something as 100% organic if non-organic methods have been used to produce it. GMO is not an organic process. It's fundamentally different from traditional plant breeding because genes from other species are artificially introduced to the seed in a laboratory. That it is *used* as a marketing label has no bearing on its legal definition. \n\nThe real issue is what I mentioned above--people who buy food are generally uneducated about agriculture. The only way to solve this problem is to educate the masses about food politics, not change the legal definition of \"organic\" to include non-organic methods. I would be more in favor of ditching the organic certification entirely and coming up with a new certification called \"Sustainably Produced\" or some such that would serve as a useful shorthand for consumers unwilling to learn something about food production. With my dream label, even GMO farms could receive a \"Sustainably Produced\" certification provided they follow guidelines about continuing crop rotations, crop mixing, and maintaining non-GMO crops to reduce the environmental effects of monoculture.\n\n&gt;I would be most people who often buy organics are also against GMOs, which means that organic farmers have to make environmental compromises in order to satisfy their customers.\n\nYou're probably right, but it seems to be that organic farmers are just as invested in the current definition as the consumers are. They can make a boatload of money and spray organic pesticides at every opportunity if they wish. But I would still argue that it's the organic label that has to go in favor of something that makes more sense, rather than change the word \"organic\" to include something that is not actually organic."}, {"id": "2q1pd2", "body": "Organic farming is supposed to be about creating an alternative to the unsustainable industrial agricultural system.

At the moment, GMOs are produced by large companies like Monsanto, and they try to sell the same few GMO seeds to everyone.  This means there is a great reduction in the plant to plant variability from one row/field to the next.  This means that all the plants have identical vulnerabilities to pests; a nasty pest can endanger all our food supply.  \n\nSustainable farming should involve each seed being genetically distinct from every other seed so that at least some plants have a resistance to any specific pest.

The criticisms by Putin and Kim have been laughed off by the media, considering the irony of those two leaders criticizing another country for its human rights record, when they each themselves have poor human rights records. North Korea especially has arguably the worst human rights record on the planet, with large scale evidence of barbaric death camps within the country's borders.\n\nHowever, in spite of the poor rights record of each country, their concerns about human rights in the US are equally as valid as the US' concern for human rights in Russia and DPRK.

Although I'm in no rush, I have been getting more serious about it recently, and really thinking about whats important to me. I have concluded that looks are the most important thing to me in a mate, not because I am superficial or shallow, but because I believe that looks are the best indicator of ones overall health, intellect, and the types of choices they make. Let me elaborate...\n\nFirst off, let me clarify that \"looks\" is both subjective and objective/universal. There are certain things like reasonable symmetry, youth (prime fertility), and good health that most people find attractive. Other things are completely subjective like race, hair color, body type, etc.... \n\nI think \"beauty\" is the default trigger of male attraction to females by nature, and for good reason. Beauty signals health, fertility, good genes, intellect, good decision making, and the subjective part of looks probably has something to do with traits that blend well with my own genes.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want my children to be healthy, intelligent, athletic, loving etc... I believe that what a person looks like on the outside is a pretty accurate indication of what they are like on the inside. There are always exceptions to the rule, like injured/diseased people etc, but I feel that this is generally true.\n\nContinuing on with why looks are important to me:\n\nYouth: Prime fertility for women is between 20 and 35. I have always found women in their mid twenties to early thirties to be the most attractive. This coincides with high fertility zones with women, increasing the chances of conception and lowering the risk of birth defects.\n\nSymmetry: I'm not huge on this but facial symmetry is a decent indicator of good genes as shown in scientific studies.\n\nBody type: I am attracted to fit, curvy women. This is more of a subjective thing when it comes to looks however there is science behind it. I'm not attracted to rail thin women or overly ripped women, and its been shown that women with body fat too low don't menstruate and are less fertile. I'm also not attracted to overweight women, which is a signal of poor impulse control, possible hormonal abnormalities, lower intellect, or other things which I would not want my children to inherit. I am attracted to curves, and both large breasts and bubble butt appear to be sexual fertility signals on an otherwise fit and healthy woman. Boobs indicate a woman can feed newborns and the shape/size/etc of the butt possibly indicates fitness levels that may be related to sex and procreation.\n\nIntellect: I feel that you can read people through their eyes and body language even more so than you can with words. These are both subsets of \"looks\". It has been said that most communication is nonverbal. You can often tell how people are wired from how they look. Perhaps they are book smart but socially inept, or incapable of abstract thought but extremely socially savvy, etc. Looks hint at how peoples brains functions. \n\nDisposition: I feel that a persons disposition, whether they are loving or vicious, compassionate or heartless can be read through their looks. This is something that is more complicated however and may not be apparent at first glance.

You just can't take specifics from population statistics like that.  \n\nIt's interesting because you're using your own faulty intuition (general statistics apply directly to individuals) to justify a different intuition (people you find attractive have better genes).  In both cases, those \"gut instincts\" are false.  That's why we have science.

Let me elaborate...\n\nFirst off, let me clarify that \"looks\" is both subjective and objective/universal. There are certain things like reasonable symmetry, youth (prime fertility), and good health that most people find attractive. Other things are completely subjective like race, hair color, body type, etc.... \n\nI think \"beauty\" is the default trigger of male attraction to females by nature, and for good reason. Beauty signals health, fertility, good genes, intellect, good decision making, and the subjective part of looks probably has something to do with traits that blend well with my own genes.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want my children to be healthy, intelligent, athletic, loving etc... I believe that what a person looks like on the outside is a pretty accurate indication of what they are like on the inside. There are always exceptions to the rule, like injured/diseased people etc, but I feel that this is generally true.\n\nContinuing on with why looks are important to me:\n\nYouth: Prime fertility for women is between 20 and 35.

This coincides with high fertility zones with women, increasing the chances of conception and lowering the risk of birth defects.\n\nSymmetry: I'm not huge on this but facial symmetry is a decent indicator of good genes as shown in scientific studies.\n\nBody type: I am attracted to fit, curvy women. This is more of a subjective thing when it comes to looks however there is science behind it. I'm not attracted to rail thin women or overly ripped women, and its been shown that women with body fat too low don't menstruate and are less fertile. I'm also not attracted to overweight women, which is a signal of poor impulse control, possible hormonal abnormalities, lower intellect, or other things which I would not want my children to inherit. I am attracted to curves, and both large breasts and bubble butt appear to be sexual fertility signals on an otherwise fit and healthy woman. Boobs indicate a woman can feed newborns and the shape/size/etc of the butt possibly indicates fitness levels that may be related to sex and procreation.\n\nIntellect: I feel that you can read people through their eyes and body language even more so than you can with words. These are both subsets of \"looks\". It has been said that most communication is nonverbal. You can often tell how people are wired from how they look. Perhaps they are book smart but socially inept, or incapable of abstract thought but extremely socially savvy, etc. Looks hint at how peoples brains functions. \n\nDisposition: I feel that a persons disposition, whether they are loving or vicious, compassionate or heartless can be read through their looks. This is something that is more complicated however and may not be apparent at first glance. It may take a long time and multiple encounters with someone to be able to read how their looks convey their disposition.\n\nSo to finish, looks are the most important thing to me.

"}, {"id": "2q0t1n", "body": "I'm a 33 year old male and I eventually want to have a happy family and children. Although I'm in no rush, I have been getting more serious about it recently, and really thinking about whats important to me. I have concluded that looks are the most important thing to me in a mate, not because I am superficial or shallow, but because I believe that looks are the best indicator of ones overall health, intellect, and the types of choices they make. Let me elaborate...\n\nFirst off, let me clarify that \"looks\" is both subjective and objective/universal. There are certain things like reasonable symmetry, youth (prime fertility), and good health that most people find attractive. Other things are completely subjective like race, hair color, body type, etc.... \n\nI think \"beauty\" is the default trigger of male attraction to females by nature, and for good reason. Beauty signals health, fertility, good genes, intellect, good decision making, and the subjective part of looks probably has something to do with traits that blend well with my own genes.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want my children to be healthy, intelligent, athletic, loving etc... I believe that what a person looks like on the outside is a pretty accurate indication of what they are like on the inside. There are always exceptions to the rule, like injured/diseased people etc, but I feel that this is generally true.\n\nContinuing on with why looks are important to me:\n\nYouth: Prime fertility for women is between 20 and 35. I have always found women in their mid twenties to early thirties to be the most attractive. This coincides with high fertility zones with women, increasing the chances of conception and lowering the risk of birth defects.\n\nSymmetry: I'm not huge on this but facial symmetry is a decent indicator of good genes as shown in scientific studies.\n\nBody type: I am attracted to fit, curvy women. This is more of a subjective thing when it comes to looks however there is science behind it. I'm not attracted to rail thin women or overly ripped women, and its been shown that women with body fat too low don't menstruate and are less fertile. I'm also not attracted to overweight women, which is a signal of poor impulse control, possible hormonal abnormalities, lower intellect, or other things which I would not want my children to inherit. I am attracted to curves, and both large breasts and bubble butt appear to be sexual fertility signals on an otherwise fit and healthy woman. Boobs indicate a woman can feed newborns and the shape/size/etc of the butt possibly indicates fitness levels that may be related to sex and procreation.\n\nIntellect: I feel that you can read people through their eyes and body language even more so than you can with words. These are both subsets of \"looks\". It has been said that most communication is nonverbal. You can often tell how people are wired from how they look. Perhaps they are book smart but socially inept, or incapable of abstract thought but extremely socially savvy, etc. Looks hint at how peoples brains functions. \n\nDisposition: I feel that a persons disposition, whether they are loving or vicious, compassionate or heartless can be read through their looks. This is something that is more complicated however and may not be apparent at first glance. It may take a long time and multiple encounters with someone to be able to read how their looks convey their disposition.\n\nSo to finish, looks are the most important thing to me. And by looks I don't mean the objectified woman who most men agree is the hottest thing ever. By looks I mean my own subjective attraction to how a particular woman appears and the message her appearance conveys to me. Perhaps most men are like this, because when most men tell their wife she's beautiful they are being honest, subjectively. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
