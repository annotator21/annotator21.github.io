Sexual attraction is not based on any personal choice, and therefore cannot be morally wrong.

It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries, the far-left has for the most part been dealt with. However the far-right continues to be a menace.\n\nI believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.\n\nOften it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.\n\nUnfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Wouldn't restricting \"free speech\" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?\n\nPolitical parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.\n\nInstead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism. After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies.\n\nBringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples. These bad apples need to be weeded out. Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You can justify mass murder as long as it's done by some institution, but as soon as an oppressed individual resists, you flip out and start shrieking about how violence is wrong. It's disgusting.\n\nI'm not sure what argument you thought I made, but it clearly wasn't the point I was trying to make. Violence in general is wrong, but sometimes it is necessary and sometimes it is justified. I was not talking about the minorities fighting back at all, but rather giving the government the power to subdue them further. The shit going on in Ferguson recently and all the riots I see as perfectly justified from a people who've been oppressed and pushed too far. My point was that the OP is talking about combating civil extremism with authoritarian extremism. How he's talking just the same as a Nazi would about the Jews or the KKK would about the blacks. Any organization or institution whose fundamental tenant is to oppress or hate or do harm to a fellow man for petty reasons is wrong. Of course it's wrong. We should not accept it, and we should raise a generation that knows better than to accept bigotry. However, by oppressing the oppressors you're only further burying and branding them with their bigotry. By trying to push them into the dark you're making them hide away with their hatred and to use it subversively. Rather than push them into a dark corner to fester, we should be dragging them out into the light to show them the failures of their ignorance. We need to have free and open discussions in the public where we can find the flaws in each other's logic. No one thinks of themselves as the bad guy, we all have a logic to our actions. Hitler was a product of an anti-semetic time, and he honestly believed that ridding the world of Jews was the best course of action. Many many people agreed. In retrospect, it was a horrific and inhumane time for the world. But to himself, and to many Nazi Germans, it was justified. It is our hindsight of victory which lends us this perspective. Had he won, perhaps we'd be having a different argument. In the 50's the battle for Civil Rights saw the KKK trying to oppress the blacks, and in their minds they were justified. There too, history could have gone another way. Though the progressive ideal is to create a world of absolute freedom, justice, and equality for every gender, sexuality, race, etc... there are groups of people, large and small, who believe their ideologies to be the most important or the most true, and the best course for the world. By giving any one central power the authority to dictate what the \"right\" decision is, you're fundamentally giving them the authority to dictate the course of history, no different than the Nazi's tried to do as well. My argument certainly is not about justifying the murder from authoritarian institutions, in fact my view is that because they are in power, institutions should be held to an even higher standard making their wrongdoings even worse, mass murder especially. That's why I've been arguing against the OP, cautioning him about the slippery slope of giving a democratic authority the power to suppress individual ideologies at will, because that kind of institutionalized power can easily corrupt.

In the context of Nazi-Germany, you're talking about a time with propaganda on both sides, most of the world being very anti-semetic, and a people who were behind Hitler because he was helping restore Germany's economic power. With the benefit of hindsight we can see how he did it, and what was so horrific about it... but that's just it. *History* \n\nIt's much easier to point to moral righteousness when you've come out victorious from the other side of war. It's much more grey when you're talking about combating extremism with extremism, and then looking at what the potential for tyrannical abuse of that power may be once we come out the other side of that portion of modern history. I mentioned it before, but speech that is hateful or threatening is not covered under our laws of free speech, and most of the modern developed nations in the world do not have such an emphasis on freedom of speech, so they too would not stand for direct threats of violence. Places of tyranny like Russia do allow hate towards the gays and hate towards other nations, but places like here treat it as terrorism. ISIS is in a war torn part of the world outside of our jurisdiction, and the KKK have had to hide themselves after coming out the other side of the history of the Civil Rights movement. Retrospective is a wonderful thing, but living in the moment as we are, trying to justify taking the offensive and attacking both internationally or domestically people who hold any ideology is something that must be weighed with the utmost care.

However the far-right continues to be a menace.\n\nI believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.\n\nOften it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.\n\nUnfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Wouldn't restricting \"free speech\" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?\n\nPolitical parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.\n\nInstead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism. After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies.\n\nBringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples.

A government of, by, and for the people.  A government where the people hold a *reasonable* influence over what happens in their government.  A government who serves the people, and is not the master of it.  To continue to beat a dead horse, a government that secures civil rights and liberties for its people and works for the common good rather than the private interest of a few.  \n\nThat's the spirit of the argument.  That America doesn't live up to the lofty ambitions that many Americans ascribe it.  Now, I'm of the opinion that America does a decent of living up to this standard, unlike what OP seems to suggest.  But we don't do an exceptional job.  We have secured  liberties that are still widely absent in several countries.  For instance, women can drive, vote, and hold public office.  We can have this conversation without being arrested and sent to a gulag.  GLBT citizens don't have to worry about being arrested.  \n\nStill, there are many aspects of our government that don't seem to work for the people.  We were lied to about the second war in Iraq (or perhaps our leaders were simply negligent or ignorant).  We have elections, however we have an incredibly high incumbent rate of reelection.

This has mainly to do with tipping as it takes place in the USA but is not limited to there.)\n\nI constantly hear and read about people who are *perceived* to be poor tippers in restaurants, bars, hotels, etc are looked down upon or some *servers* will go as far as spitting or otherwise violating one's food if they return in the future.\n\nThe problem, as I see it, is that what is considered to be the *norm* for tipping (or weather to tip at all) can differ greatly in different places (country to country, state/province to state/province, city to city, or even within the same town.) Yet people end up being labeled a \"cheapskate\" and/or an \"asshole\" when what it really amounts to is a misunderstanding. To make matters worse, it also seems to be considered awkward to even ask about it, making it essentially a catch-22.\n\nA lot of people blanket arguments that \"servers/waiters/bar-tenders/etc\" make below minimum wage, but such people leave out the fact that a lot of servers make *above* minimum wage, and it varies from place to place.\n\nIn addition, I feel many servers that are underpaid act like every patron should somehow be aware of that fact and tip *more* because of it. First of all, as a customer, I have no way of knowing that. Second, no patron is required to know about internal information of an establishment, such as how much a given employee is paid.\n\nRegardless of how much you're paid, it is your job to serve, that's what you were hired to do, that you agreed to do. Therefore I honestly don't understand that \"I'll spit in your food\" mentality that comes about if a patron doesn't tip to what a server has come to consider \"normal.\"\n\nThis seems to stem from a rather strong sense of entitlement. With all due respect, just because you do something for someone doesn't automatically entitle you to compensation. People do things for others with no expectation to be paid all the time. This goes hand-in-hand with the traditional definition of a tip being something *extra* given as a thank you if a customer so chooses, which is in contrast with the expected-or-you're-a-target variation that it's been commonly twisted into.\n\nI welcome other views on this and counter arguments to what I have submitted above. Just don't just say \"You're wrong\" but explain why you feel that way. Thank you.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I am going to come at this argument in the way you titled it.\n\n1. You are giving too much credit to people simply not knowing what the proper tip is. Country to country is understandable, but state to state? Is the difference really big enough where someone can tip just fine all the time in one state but not in another? I don't believe so. The difference is mainly from restaurant to restaurant. I am not going to tip as much in a cheap hibachi grill as I will in a nice restaurant, and I find it hard to believe someone would want to tip a server well but not tip enough if they are eating at a nice restaurant. \n\n2. But they might not be. I could say the same argument about why people should always tip more than necessary, you don't know the financial health of the server.\n\n3. What do you think a job is?

This has mainly to do with tipping as it takes place in the USA but is not limited to there.)\n\nI constantly hear and read about people who are *perceived* to be poor tippers in restaurants, bars, hotels, etc are looked down upon or some *servers* will go as far as spitting or otherwise violating one's food if they return in the future.\n\nThe problem, as I see it, is that what is considered to be the *norm* for tipping (or weather to tip at all) can differ greatly in different places (country to country, state/province to state/province, city to city, or even within the same town.) Yet people end up being labeled a \"cheapskate\" and/or an \"asshole\" when what it really amounts to is a misunderstanding. To make matters worse, it also seems to be considered awkward to even ask about it, making it essentially a catch-22.\n\nA lot of people blanket arguments that \"servers/waiters/bar-tenders/etc\" make below minimum wage, but such people leave out the fact that a lot of servers make *above* minimum wage, and it varies from place to place.\n\nIn addition, I feel many servers that are underpaid act like every patron should somehow be aware of that fact and tip *more* because of it. First of all, as a customer, I have no way of knowing that. Second, no patron is required to know about internal information of an establishment, such as how much a given employee is paid.\n\nRegardless of how much you're paid, it is your job to serve, that's what you were hired to do, that you agreed to do. Therefore I honestly don't understand that \"I'll spit in your food\" mentality that comes about if a patron doesn't tip to what a server has come to consider \"normal.\"\n\nThis seems to stem from a rather strong sense of entitlement. With all due respect, just because you do something for someone doesn't automatically entitle you to compensation. People do things for others with no expectation to be paid all the time. This goes hand-in-hand with the traditional definition of a tip being something *extra* given as a thank you if a customer so chooses, which is in contrast with the expected-or-you're-a-target variation that it's been commonly twisted into.\n\nI welcome other views on this and counter arguments to what I have submitted above. Just don't just say \"You're wrong\" but explain why you feel that way. Thank you.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

We see this more in our young generation, and that means that our future will be more obsessed. Smartphones, tablets, computers, consoles, and television are more and more pulling us away from booms and even real life. \n\nSecond: We are seeing more and more people getting offended in our \"crusade\" for \"social justice\". I am not saying that it is the majority or even a sizeable minority that is doing this, and I myself believe that people should do whatever floats their boat as long as it doesn't cause serious harm to others or themselves. But when I see people wanting to burn books because they are offended, I think more and more to Captain Beatty and what he said \"Bigger the population, the more minorities.

Dystopian books are written as a warning to society, it would be dumb to write a dystopian book that it cannot be seen society ever getting that bad.\n\nThe crucial difference,however, is that \"screens\" in the book isolated people, where the screens in our life today keep us more connected. These types of screens didn't exist in the book, where screens today connect us instantly to whoever we really want to be connected to.\n\nTo your second point, while there may be a select few who get offended to the point of wanting to burn books of certain authors, it doesn't appear society is very keen today on censorship.

Smartphones, tablets, and computers all expand our ability to browse through information; and the average person today has access to more information and art than any other person in history. If you wanted to argue that the content of this information and art has declined in quality and meaning (As Bradbury feared it would), that is a different argument for a different day.\n\n&gt; Second: We are seeing more and more people getting offended in our \"crusade\" for \"social justice\".\n\nThe pendulum has always swung between intellectual libertarianism and intellectual authoritarianism. Even in the past fifty years, we saw 50's paranoia and artificial nationalism give way to the now legendary counterculture of the late 60's, only to see the American people seize up again with conservative moralism in the 1980's. the \"social justice\" conflicts I believe you are referring to are just the members of both sides getting at each others throats again; but over the broad course of history, we have moved away from violent and destructive opposition to intellectual dissent."}, {"id": "2qb80d", "body": "As my title says, I think we are heading towards a future like in Farenheit 451, more so than 1984 or Brave New World.
