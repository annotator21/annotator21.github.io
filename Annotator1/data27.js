I don't know if knowing that would settle your mind or accept the situation any more than you already have.\n\nThe same government programs that facilitate getting people jobs like this also have provisions where the pay rate is literally in the slave labor zone.  This is because the job is not meant to support them fully, but is meant to keep them socially integrated into society versus locked away at home alone/with only their immediate caregivers.  The job duties and pay are a far and much less emphasized second goal in this whole concept.  Now this may sound like I have an axe to grind with these low paying programs, but I don't.  Seriously.  I see them as providing a great service.  The extremely low pay requirement incentives more employers to hire people in need, and to put up with a reasonable amount of issues that often come along with the employee.  \n\n\n**EDIT:**  Looks like it is not even nessisarily part of the specifc programs, but is an allowance under federal law.  In the good old US of A at least....\n\n**\"A provision in the Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) of 1938 gives employers the right to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage. At Goodwill, explains Leigland, disabled employees take a timed test to see how quickly they can sort and hang a rack of clothes. The garments must be facing to the left and the top buttons fastened and separated into men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s sections. Goodwill wants workers to be able to hang 100 garments with no errors in 32 minutes. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it that quickly because we can\u2019t look at a garment and see the size,\u201d she says about her experience and her husband\u2019s.

Perhaps your store only needs a little help, and they provide that little bit. They're not actually a burden, you just perceive it that way because they're not taking an equal share of the task, but the task you have is something you can handle without excess exertion, and the same goes for them. \n\nConsider it this way. A large, strong person and a small, weak person are tasked with moving 300 lbs of stuff 100 feet. They resolve to carry it as the best method. An equal share would be 150 lbs, which the strong person would carry with relative ease (75% max load) while the weak would struggle unduly (125% max load). A more fair compromise would be perhaps a 200/100 split, or 125/175 even. Both workers will be pulling maximum output for their potential, perhaps like your store.

He didn't try hard to do his job, he didn't stay focused on tasks, and would flatly refuse to do anything he didn't want to do.

I'm sure that with the intervention of some type of trained professional something could have been created that would have helped or lessened some of the very real issues you're bringing up.

If these incentives aren't there, you're not motivated and it becomes very hard to do your job. What's different is the the things that motivate us. You can hold people to the same standards, but then you also have to provide the same standards being the right kind of motivation.

But to help elucidate my issue let me tell you about the two employees I worked with. \n\nChanging names obviously, so let's call them Ricky and Julian. I never asked specifically about their illnesses so all I can report on are my observations. \n\nJulian was a much older man, probably 50+ and he seemed to function about as well as a nine or ten year old. He was a sweet man who loved interacting with the customers, tried his hardest, and was nice to everyone. I liked Julian and didn't mind helping him out when he was having a tough time, for example he needed help working the time clock because he couldn't read very well. If Julian was the only handicapped person I ever worked with, my opinion would be different. \n\nThe problem was Ricky. He was a little younger and seemed to be a bit more higher functioning. I'm not sure how to quantify the difference between these guys, but with Julian you felt like you were talking to someone who wasn't all there, while Ricky felt like he was all there, just slow? \n\nAnyway this guy was just a jerk. I feel bad for thinking that because I'm sure his life is filled with many more challenges than mine, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. He didn't try hard to do his job, he didn't stay focused on tasks, and would flatly refuse to do anything he didn't want to do. I saw him many times frustrate the front side supervisors because he would literally wander around the store hiding when he didn't want to work. He wasn't incapable, he could do it and do it well when he wanted. He was just an insensitive contrarian. \n\nThat kind of behavior from a neurotypical employee resulted in termination. I watched coworkers get fired for less, but it seemed like no matter what he did it was impossible to fire Ricky without seeming discriminatory, and I think that's wrong. \n\nJulian worked his hardest and happily completed his tasks, I have absolutely no problem working with him. \nRicky acted like a petulant child and actively made other people's job harder, but we were stuck with him because we either couldn't or wouldn't fire him for underperforming and blatantly disobeying.\n\n"}, {"id": "cnagey2", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cnagey2", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cnakm6m", "body": "Sorry score_, your comment has been removed: \n\n&gt; Comment Rule 1\\. \"Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP\u2019s current view (however minor), unless they are asking a clarifying question.

Those are the things television and our mothers tell us we should want. Nothing here speaks even to your personal proclivities - if I may allow myself a piece of advice, you might discover you are much more determined and powerful if you find yourself some goals that speak only to you, rather than to your MTV-inspired fantasy of what success looks like. Back to your question, yes, I think that, by the body of sociological-economic literature on this subject and by most people's lived experiences, people who are born rich and famous are more likely to stay rich and famous than poor black kids from Detroit. That's why the inequality debate is so important: inequality often suggests a lack of meritocracy, meaning that a poor person even with excellent natural ability won't be able to transcend the accident of their birth in trying to gain access to socially-mandated success.\n\nBut there are at least two other metrics by which we can determine success. One, as you say, is personal happiness. Somerset Maugham has an excellent book, *The Razor's Edge*, which really brought this idea home for me: he follows the lives of a group of friends, who all start out in the same community but end up living very different lives, but who all got what they wanted. One of them is a girl from a rich East Coast family who always felt out of place in her society, who ends up a port prostitute in Marseilles, and her old friend tries to save her but she doesn't want to because that's the life she likes, even if she isn't happy. This example is more complex than the standard I-want-to-be-a-poet-I-don't-care-for-money shit, but that's what I mean. The key is that people often want something different from what they \"should\" want, and getting that for you as an individual is success, as long as you can learn to ignore the haters.\n\nA different metric is whether they improved their life station. Say you're the heir to a rich fortune. Some heirs increase their fortune, some heirs squander it, some heirs just kind of exist. If you managed to increase your fortune, you've been successful because you took whatever resources you had and you turned them into a profit. If you squander, it's the opposite, and if you don't do anything, that's also kind of a failure but not such a drastic one. This is actually the metric of success employed in social science, including economics: whether you are doing better today than you were yesterday."}, {"id": "2qwbde", "body": "I believe an upwards of about 90% of your success/quality in life is determined when you are born.

Essentially they have never been foster children.\n\nAdoptees are basically any child who has been foster children at one point or another.\n\nAdoptees are more likely to either be adopted by poorer families or to not be adopted at all. This leads to a drastically lower parental income (x-axis) which affects the quality of life of the child including their educations. This in turn affects their income as an adult.

Despite how expensive education is in America, a very casual glance at your local university might change your mind as to how small an obstacle money is compared to pure ambition. I come from a third world country and I am surrounded by countless others from similar backgrounds. One thing that is common for communities I live in, is to support yourself and manage your own expenses. I feel if some kid from a third world country can come into America, get scholarships, work side by side well upto 40 hours a week then anybody else in the world can do it. It is all dependent on your will and determination. \nThat is perhaps the only reason why the asian community in America has the highest per capita consumption and is estimated to spend about $700 bn (I might not have the right figures) annually. You will be surprised to learn how well the immigrant communities are doing, even black people (who we stereotype sometime as being poor and uneducated) have higher than median incomes when they come from abroad. Nigerians and Libyans have some of the highest living standards and education in America.\nOn the other hand, coming from a privileged background is no gurantee for success either. Historically speaking people have been very bad at handling inheritances, often depleting their resources within two or three generation before the newer generations comes to a median level as the rest of the population. That is unless, you do inherit more than just money from your parents. Intelligence,skill,hardwork these things matter and if some of the rich parent's good qualities don't rub off on their kids, it is likely they would be reaching for bankruptcy. \nSo in the end, you have to use whatever tool you have to your best to be successful. Just being born with a silver spoon doesn't mean you will live like a king for the rest of your days and being born in a slum doesn't mean you will be a beggar for the rest of your life.

Yes, a lot of people are born in circumstances that most likely prohibit them from becoming a lawyer in America (or some other typical \"goal\" here). But as you can imagine, if I were born in a tribe in Africa, the concept of a quality life tying back to a $4k/month pad in the sky doesn't exist and there are more reachable goals that will give me that quality.\n\nBeyond that, it's hard to quantify \"most\". There are tons of examples where your birth directly restricts your ability to succeed like if you were  born into slavery or born retarded or any other thing you could imagine. But just because those circumstances exist, I don't see it immediately jumping to the conclusion that most people are bound by them. \n\nTypically, obsession and hard work are required, regardless of innate ability, to be truly good at something (\"success\"), and you often need to be truly good at something to feel good about yourself and to make money (typical forms of life quality). Taking the US as an example, I noticed that most \"losers\" in life, they often complain too, are just chilling 24/7. They are always watching TV, playing video games, texting, surfing the web, or some other relaxing feat of nothing. I've also noticed that they come with all sorts of biological gifts or curses, some geniuses and some dunces. I honestly believe that if you work hard on yourself and are not in an extreme circumstance, you can succeed in some way.

Just wanted to make that clear before moving forward (because I will address your points).\n\n&gt; Whether they see money or not is irrelevant in my opinion. Nobody\n&gt; deserves to make a profit.

I suppose you'd be inclined to return to this time? What did or didn't happen historically is only relevant to the present in what mistakes we should seek to avoid making. Just because something isn't the \"traditional way\" of making money doesn't mean you shouldn't be expected to make money that way. Manufacturing wasn't a \"traditional\" way of making money, so should we deny them money by breaking into the factory and stealing all the sofas? After all, by your own argument, manufacturing is only a recent (on even the human timescale) invention, and therefore not a traditional way of making money (or sofas, for that matter), so let's go steal the damn things! Perfectly OK, right?\n\nYou argument is so self serving that it's clear you care about nothing and no one except those you consider your immediate friends, family, and property. If you have a job, you'd argue that you yourself don't deserve a profit, that you should be paid nothing for your job and you should be content with it? After all, you're making a profit when you go to your job - there's no monetary investment on your part in your job, but you get money out of it! BLASPHEMY!\n\n&gt; Absolutely yes. My friends and I share music all the time, and spend\n&gt; money going to concerts of bands we like. Listening to recordings is\n&gt; nice but it is nothing compared to a live performance. If we go back\n&gt; to the cookie reference, it's one thing to share a photo of a cookie\n&gt; and another to physically eat one.\n\nYour cookie metaphor doesn't quite work. You're not sharing photos of a cookie - even if you argue that the live experience has an extra facet of reality to it, you can't simplify that to the picture of a cookie. You're still getting the essence of the cookie out of it when you pirate MP3s - you're just not getting the whole thing. You get the taste, but not the temperature, texture, crunchiness or softeness, smell, etc. It's closer to the difference between a real cookie and a cookie-flavored milk drink. And maybe you don't pay as much for a cookie-flavored milk drink as for a cookie, but somehow I doubt you claim \"This isn't a cookie,\" grab said drink, and sprint out of the grocery store, avoiding guards and police. This is, however, what you're advocating.\n\nYour piracy of that music denies not only the musician, but also the recording technician, the track mixer, the CD burner, the CD printer, the distributor, and the retailer money. And say what you like about musicians, but as long as those other careers have existed, they are doing what they have traditionally done in those careers to make money.

From a moral standpoint, they want to support the artists as best as possible. So the criteria for measuring morality for them is money the artists make.\n\nThere's some evidence to suggest that many of the biggest record labels are doing harm to artists. They maximize profits for themselves and the artists/consumers are an afterthought. Do you remember SOPA? It was an attack on free speech in order to maximize profits. And this idustry is by no means in decline, see [the Sky is Rising](https://www.techdirt.com/skyisrising/).\n\nSay there's a certain amount of money you'll spend on music in total in a given year. I've calculated that my friends and I spend about $60 a year on music. Even if we spent more than that, after a certain point we'd be broke if we spent any more.\n\nMy strategy is to spend as much of that $60 each year on music services like Bandcamp, which offer adjustable pricing and direct to artist sales. If I can spend most of my $60 on that instead of on music sold by major record labels who sue people and treat their artists poorly, then in effect I'm boycotting the part of the music industry that I don't like.\n\nSo if you're only going to spend a max $60 on music in a given year, it won't matter how much you pirate. How you spend it will matter.\n\nI'm saying this because in your title, you said \"loss to the copyright holder\". I think this isn't the criteria you should look at. If the copyright holder is an artist I love, then I want to spend more of my $60 on their music. If the copyright holder is a crappy record label that I don't like, then I want to spend less money on them.\n\nPoint being: sometimes your goal *is* to create a loss to the copyright holder.\n\nNow, there are plenty of artists that I love who are signed on to major record labels. I feel bad that I'm saying \"Too bad! You're on a record label that I don't like! No money for you!\". So what I do I try my best to support them in other ways. Buy merchandise, go to a concert, tell all my friends about their music so that they might buy it. And as a last resort I might buy it. Buying might be supporting a crappy record label that I don't like, but if I have no other options I'll go for it.

Your post specifically compelled me to respond and discuss \"fairness\" in taxes. \n\n&gt;**What constitutes fair?** Is it that in your example, under a flat tax both people are paying 20% of their income? Some might say that is extremely unfair because $4,000 is much more important to someone only making $20,000.\n\nTo give some background, I am an engineering graduate and have about five years of post graduate experience in my field. I specifically try to analyze and reason things mathematically, and I thought that my perspective in relation to the terminology of \"fairness\" might be relevant. First off, I think that there are a few important things to understand when discussing what is \"fair\" when it is in relation to taxes, or anything for that matter.\n\nFirst off, let's consider what \"fair\" means in the context of individual to individual, specifically in this situation.\n\n**Fair - free from bias, dishonesty, or injustice.**\n\nArguably, the \"fairest\" system would be one in which every single person pays the same amount towards the tax pool. That is the only system that truly is *\"free from bias, dishonesty, or injustice\"*. In such a system, no outside factors would be considered relevant to an individual. This system is similarly applicable when one goes to buy an automobile, television or computer. No outside factors (excluding discount clubs, or coupons) are considered when this price is negotiated. This is what is considered \"fair\", where every individual, regardless of race, ethnicity or religious background pays the same price for the automobile, television or computer. \n\nOn the contrary, any system that is weighted to favor a specific variable or factor is considered \"biased\". Thus, scholarship programs and tax brackets are not actually a \"fair\" system, they are \"biased\" systems. That's fine though, biased doesn't necessarily carry a negative connotation in regards to this. These systems are intended to be \"biased\" to promote economic equality. But, let's not confuse what one judges as being \"moral\" with \"fair\".\n\nNow, let's get back to your original statement. \n\n- Q : \"What constitutes fair?\"\n\n- A : Fair, in this context, is a system free of bias, dishonesty, or injustice. A system that factors in any outside influence, whether that be race, religion, or socioeconomic status is a biased system. The tax system we currently live in is defined as a \"biased\" system. It considers several \"bias\" factors: donations, dependents, income, location, debt, etc. Any system that does such is not \"fair\".\n\n- Q : Is it that in your example, under a flat tax both people are paying 20% of their income? Some might say that is extremely unfair because $4,000 is much more important to someone only making $20,000.\n\n- A : Technically, no, this isn't a fair system. Would it be \"fair\" for me to sell you a service based on how much income you made? Let's assume that I made $50,000 a year and you made $100,000 a year. Would it be \"fair\" for you to pay twice as much for the same automobile, television, or car? Would it be fair to charge you twice as much to fix your broken appliances? The short answer is no. So why is it \"fair\" that an individual who makes a higher income should pay more into a tax system that everyone has equal access to? I am all for things being \"morally just\" but to confuse that with \"fair\" is a whole different issue entirely.\n\nLet's be clear here, I understand the principle behind \"spreading the burden\". I haven't exactly ran the numbers, but I am sure if you took the necessary tax revenue and divided it by the number of Americans and then applied that charge to every citizen, there would be a large percentage of people that couldn't pay that. I get that, every fiscally conservative person gets that. I don't think anyone is asking for a \"flat amount tax\", I certainly am not, and most people understand that it wouldn't work that way. However, if we are seeking a \"fair\" system, that is the most \"fair\". I would conclude that the \"flat tax percentage\" is *less biased* than a system that includes numerous variables and factors. IE - The more factors that weigh into what your tax percentage is, the less \"fair\" it becomes.\n\nThe short of it is simply this **\"Fair isn't necessarily right. Right isn't necessarily fair.\"** I know this sounds overly simplified and probably isn't all that helpful, but it's important to consider what truly is \"Fair\". To me, fair systems are ones that are free of **ALL** bias, even the ones we consider to be \"morally just\".

It considers several \"bias\" factors: donations, dependents, income, location, debt, etc. Any system that does such is not \"fair\".\n\n- Q : Is it that in your example, under a flat tax both people are paying 20% of their income? Some might say that is extremely unfair because $4,000 is much more important to someone only making $20,000.\n\n- A : Technically, no, this isn't a fair system. Would it be \"fair\" for me to sell you a service based on how much income you made? Let's assume that I made $50,000 a year and you made $100,000 a year. Would it be \"fair\" for you to pay twice as much for the same automobile, television, or car? Would it be fair to charge you twice as much to fix your broken appliances? The short answer is no. So why is it \"fair\" that an individual who makes a higher income should pay more into a tax system that everyone has equal access to? I am all for things being \"morally just\" but to confuse that with \"fair\" is a whole different issue entirely.\n\nLet's be clear here, I understand the principle behind \"spreading the burden\". I haven't exactly ran the numbers, but I am sure if you took the necessary tax revenue and divided it by the number of Americans and then applied that charge to every citizen, there would be a large percentage of people that couldn't pay that. I get that, every fiscally conservative person gets that. I don't think anyone is asking for a \"flat amount tax\", I certainly am not, and most people understand that it wouldn't work that way. However, if we are seeking a \"fair\" system, that is the most \"fair\". I would conclude that the \"flat tax percentage\" is *less biased* than a system that includes numerous variables and factors. IE - The more factors that weigh into what your tax percentage is, the less \"fair\" it becomes.\n\nThe short of it is simply this **\"Fair isn't necessarily right. Right isn't necessarily fair.\"** I know this sounds overly simplified and probably isn't all that helpful, but it's important to consider what truly is \"Fair\". To me, fair systems are ones that are free of **ALL** bias, even the ones we consider to be \"morally just\". Just some food for thought! :D"}, {"id": "cnanzfw", "body": "You're ignoring the fact that income in and of itself is a variable that creates bias.  It isn't any more inherently fair to use \"gross income\" versus \"adjusted income\".  The point is that you need to choose a variable and each of those variables creates a necessary bias and a different definition of fairness.\n\nEven if you evenly distributed the tax burden among all citizens, how is that free from injustice, bias, and dishonesty?

These are definitely some very good points to make, and I want to expound on what you have said as well as throw some alternative perspectives your way. Perhaps where I am coming from will make a little more sense with some additional discussion.\n\n&gt;You're ignoring the fact that income in and of itself is a variable that creates bias. It isn't any more inherently fair to use \"gross income\" versus \"adjusted income\". The point is that you need to choose a variable and each of those variables creates a necessary bias and a different definition of fairness.\n\n&gt;**Even if you evenly distributed the tax burden among all citizens, how is that free from injustice, bias, and dishonesty?**\n\nTo be clear, income is not a factor in the hypothetical \"Tax System\" I was discussing. The equation would be described as:\n\n- (Tax Amount for Fiscal Year) / (Population) = Tax Amount / Person\n\nSo, actually, the contrary is true. Income is not considered a factor in this equation. We can agree that \"income\" is certainly a bias in many other systems, similarly to race / gender / age etc. However, this system ignores that, it ignores income inequality and treats everyone equal... or as we have previously defined, \"fair\". It's important to consider that in this case, the hypothetical \"Tax System\" I propose is indisputably **\"fair\"** since it considers absolutely no outside factors. I think what you are arguing is that society doesn't treat people fairly, an entirely different argument, albeit very true. However, projecting society's imperfections on mathematical models and then claiming them to be \"fair\" is wrong in my opinion.\n\nSo, just to reiterate, in this hypothetical \"Tax System\", no variables need to be chosen, there is no bias included, and everyone pays exactly the same amount regardless of any outside variables. That is, by definition, **\"fair\"**. You could definitely make a point that while my hypothetical \"Tax System\" is indeed fair, the underlying elements in society and economics are **not** fair. I think that is the deeper message of this sub-discussion, and why I intended to highlight what a \"fair\" system would be by definition. IE - **\"Fair isn't necessarily right. Right isn't necessarily fair.\"** \n\nThe point I am trying to make is that using a tax system to correct socioeconomic issues, and then claiming it is **\"fair\"** is entirely wrong. The more correct thing to say would be, \"Our current socioeconomic policies do not promote fairness, thus, we currently use a **biased** tax system to adjust for these factors.\"\n\n&gt;People don't use an equal amount of public services, so by that measure, a consumption tax would be more fair.\n\nSure, people don't use an equal amount of public services, however consider the precedent set in general when you \"purchase a service\". Let's assume you and I both purchase the same cable television subscription, I might watch 2 hours a week of television, and you might watch 20 hours a week of television. We pay the same amount, is that fair? I would say yes, since we both agreed to a terms and conditions and are provided **equal access**. Note the key being that I have equal access to the service as you, I might not choose to use it all the time, and outside factors might prevent me from using it. Does it make cable television subscriptions **biased**? No. Infact, it makes them \"fair\" since they do not consider any bias. They are removed from any connection to income / race / gender / age etc. Everyone pays the same, regardless of those factors. Your accessibility is equivalent to all other subscribers in that system. I would say the same applies to the public services provided by tax funding. I might not use them as much as another individual, but since they are public, access is equivalent and thus removed from bias.\n\n&gt;You can't make a system that is free from bias.\n\nInfact, I would argue that you can. By choosing to exclude every source of bias, any mathematical model can be considered \"fair\". I think you are confusing the underlying elements of society to be unfair with the system itself. The truth is, these underlying elements of bias (income / race / gender / age) are all **inputs** into the current tax system, and thus makes the system inherently biased. A fair system would be removed of these, which can be done, as I made the case for earlier.\n\n&gt;Because of this, I think it is most prudent to try and develop the taxation system that is most beneficial to the economy as a whole and the well-being of a majority of citizens.\n\nI want to make one point in relation to this, because from my perspective, I find that this is generally what is wrong with the world, and I don't mean to make an example of you specifically but perhaps it might change your perspective. What we have here is using \"systems\" to correct inherent bias, it patches a problem but fails to fix the source. The reason that a flat tax amount wouldn't work is because there are a majority of people that do not make enough to pay an equivalent share. Or, if they do, it would take so much of their net worth that it would not allow them to sustain their normal way of life. What that highlights to me is that our current socioeconomic system in this country isn't working, people are not where they should be in terms of being able to fend for themselves. Call it a Curse of Capitalism or what you will, but it is a serious problem, one that is a precondition to why a **fair** Tax System wouldn't work. The solution to this problem inherently lies in what causes the bias, not \"adjusting\" for bias. In short, we can't claim that a system that \"adjusts for bias or inequality\" is a \"fair\" system. By default, any system that even considers bias is a biased system.\n\nThanks again for your response, hopefully this explains my position a little bit better, and you're right, it's rarely the case that what is \"right\" and what is \"fair\" are one in the same."}, {"id": "cna9pg6", "body": "I hate using the word \"fair\" when it comes to taxes because it's a subjective term.\n\nWhat constitutes fair?  Is it that in your example, under a flat tax both people are paying 20% of their income?

This minimum cost of living applies to everyone.  Let's assume that comes to $15,000/yr.  Under your flat tax, someone making $20,000 would pay $4,000 in taxes and be left with $1,000.  If they run into any sort of emergency, they could be financially ruined whereas the person making $100,000 and paying $20,000 in taxes could conceivably have $80,000 as a buffer.\n\nYes, as a percentage of income, flat taxes may be considered fair.  But it's a drastically larger burden upon low income earners and all but destroys their ability to move themselves up the economic ladder.\n\nThat said, I'd need to think about the constantly variable scale that OP is proposing.

Hard work features heavily in both cases - the distinguishing factor is luck. Progressive taxation works to \"level out\" *some* small part of this luck, taking from those who have won the life-chances lottery and giving to those who didn't do so well. Of course, very little of what is taken from the tax lawyer goes to the child in Delhi - but more should.  \nThe second point is that an extra dollar for a millionaire buys far less utility than an extra dollar for a pauper. Therefore, if one measures what each individual loses in terms of lost utility rather than lost dollars, it is far more efficient to collect those dollars from those who are losing very little utility as each dollar is taken, than to collect it from those who lose very large amounts of utility.

Instead of $4500 in take-home, I'll only get $4000 in take home due to the increase in marginal tax rate.\n\nAm I going to refuse $22000 when I could have stayed at my old responsibilities and made $18000? Would I take the new responsibilities for $22500, but not for $22000?

Now, we are happy that we can plug one number in, and get the amount of tax to be paid out of the formula.  We just enter it into the box.\n\nBut wait, we still want to allow for paper filings, right?  We shouldn't assume that everybody filing their taxes has a computer.  So, whatever function we choose should be limited to things that can be done by hand.\n\nWhat does that leave us with?  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and (sometimes) division.  Ideally, we would avoid division, since long division can be tricky by hand.  This leaves us with any polynomial representation.\n\nHowever, polynomials tend to be rather poorly behaved.  At the high or low ends, they are guaranteed to expand outside of any bounds.  We could just add enough terms to the polynomial that it is stable out to any reasonable limit.  This would increase the number of steps necessary to calculate tax by hand.\n\nInstead, we could approximate our continuous function using a linear function.  That way, it only requires multiplication, addition, and checking of if-then statements.  This would also be easier to manipulate, as one can see a direct effect by changing the key points of a linear function.  That way, the legislature does not need to perform any advanced analysis to know what effect a change will have.  They can simply push the function into the desired shape.\n\nAnd then we're right back to where we started, with a piecewise linear function, most commonly known as tax brackets."}, {"id": "2quzrj", "body": "Rather than having a fixed number of income tax bands there should be a continuous function relating your salary to the rate of tax that you pay.\n\n(In the following example I\u2019m making up numbers to demonstrate a point so it wont be accurate)\n\nI don\u2019t think it makes sense to tax someone 10% on their first $30k and 20% on their next $30k.

It also allows people to move up pretty freely within a bracket without taking a penalty at all.  It's just really hard to see an upside on being taxed on everything vs being taxed on money as you make it.\n\nWhich brings up another issue.  How do you determine your tax amount in the beginning of the year?  In the current system since you're taxed on a bracket you're at it's free to move up as you earn throughout the year.  On the equation system you have to know gross earnings before you calculate the rates.  Meaning that you either have to overestimate the tax rate (and get a huge refund) or underestimate it (and have to pay).  This on top of the already present exemptions and credits makes an already complex system even more complex.\n\n&gt; why should people earning 49k be taxed 10c for every extra dollar they earn when people earning 50k are taxed 20c for every extra dollar?  They have almost the same salary but one person is charged double for the extra effort they put into earning an extra dollar.\n\nBecause the guy earning &gt;50k is still paying the same tax rate as the guy making 49k on his first 49k.  Everyone is taxed at the same rates for the same pools of money they earn.  The only difference is that the guy earning more eventually enters a bigger pool and pays accordingly.  With an equation system he's penalized on his first 49k (say he's taxed at 20% overall) compared to the guy making only 49k (say who's only taxed at 15% overall).  He's paying a 5% penalty on the same money that the lower earner made, which isn't really fair.\n"}, {"id": "cn9vhlk", "body": "On the problem of being taxed differently for each extra dollar you earn:\n\nThanks for your example, it helps to show what page we are both on.\n\nIt isn't a problem that you are taxed 0.01% more on everything or 5% more on $1, in your example it worked out as if you were paying 50 cent more on your extra $1 so for salaries around 50k each additional dollar is taxed at *about* 50%. This is like the band system but instead of the fixed 30% on all extra income you're paying a rate which is reasonably steady around 50% (unless your income increases a lot).\n50% might sound like a lot but it is balanced out because your first few thousand earned are taxed at around 10%.\n\n&gt;Depending on how your equation works out vs the band system in reality it could be even worse. Or better. It would depend on where you're sitting on that line, which ultimately isn't fair.\n\nIt would work out as being worse for those near the top of their bands and better for those near the bottom of the bands. I do think that this is more fair; suppose the bands are 10% up to 25k and 20% from 25-50k, why should people earning 49k be taxed 10c for every extra dollar they earn when people earning 50k are taxed 20c for every extra dollar? They have almost the same salary but one person is charged double for the extra effort they put into earning an extra dollar.\n\nI wish I had a more detailed calculation but I believe the figures would work out something like 9c extra tax for someone earning 25k, 18c extra for someone on a 49k salary and 19c extra for someone earning 50k."}, {"id": "cn9wsx2", "body": "Another problem is how you deal with people at the poverty line.\n\nIf you're earnings are below poverty you'd be paying 0% tax, but on the extra dollar that puts you over it you're suddenly paying 5-10% on *everything* effectively causing that extra dollar earned to cost you.

Thank you!\n\n_____\nIt is my contention that the property destruction and disruption of commerce in Ferguson are the only reasons that this issue gained international attention.  We have a democracy that acts almost exclusively in the interests of a small handful of corporate elites and government officials, which causes actual human suffering to be on the back burner.  Other avenues for political redress such as voting and even peaceful protesting by itself (which are ultimately more effective in the end, but typically only after having a flash point or event to rally around) have been largely compromised by corporate interests and strategic incapacitation policing techniques.  There are racially tinged police murders under far less ambiguous circumstances wherein the behavior of the officers is much more difficult to justify that never gained as much traction when protesters hold exclusively peaceful demonstrations, and it underlies our society's perpetual valuing of windows and business over actual human lives.  Moreover, high profile riots make white middle America (which controls the political arena) evaluate the issue.  When White America is afraid that traffic will be blocked, or that their business might be burned/looted, or that a brick might come flying through their living room window, this forces the issue into the public consciousness and varying solutions must be considered.  \n\nMany say that the property destruction opened the issue to easy critiques since many are beholden to heavily indoctrinated notions of bourgeois morality (the old two wrongs don't make a right adage, even when one wrong is a death and the other is property being destroyed/stolen), and while this is true it gave people a cause to rally around.  White America and the media are masterful at rationalizing and ignoring systemic racism and police brutality, and while the #blacklivesmatter is obvious propaganda it has kept the discussion of racist policing in the public discourse since it did grow organically after a high profile police shooting.  The rioters took action which has a strong psychological impact on those for whom the issue resonates.  Taking action (even a less than ideal one) has much weight than people claiming to \"support\" a cause without actually giving anything of themselves to it.\n\nThe tactic of rallying around a murder to highlight racist inequity has been employed since the Classic Civil Rights Era (see the murder of Emmett Till), and people arguing over whether or not the particular murder in question was less than ideal miss the point entirely.  People are talking about the murder, and (even if for a brief second) the issues that sparked the outrage though this more important narrative is tightly controlled by a media apparatus hellbent on fixating on the explosion than the planting and lighting of the bomb that caused it.  Had it been a perfect situation with the cops saying \"nigger\" before shooting a completely sympathetic victim and even if it was video recorded by a very credible witness, the discussion would have easily devolved into \"this particular cop was just a bad egg,\" and the protests got what they wanted when he was fired/convicted.  \n\nBecause of the ambiguity in the Ferguson shooting, the stark contrasts in *perceptions* among blacks and whites becomes a primary issue of contention.  It's not about bad cops getting out of hand on occasion, but about why so many black people have the idea that the cops treat them unfairly or with undue violence.   No one would have even been talking about that had the case been less focused on contradictory narratives, and it would have never even made international news if the police hadn't responded in a militarized fashion to the peaceful protests that were mobilized after the initial riots.  This uproar was never about police militarization or even bad egg cops.  It is about public policies that have created racist law enforcement practices that marginalize and inflame the black community. Not many have said it that articulately, but it's bubbling underneath the surface of the \"national discussion\" on Ferguson.  In an ideal democracy, third party property destruction would perhaps not be a valid form of political voicing, but as blacks are particularly disenfranchised politically and economically in the US, so using militant tactics to express rage at the societal failings I mentioned above are not only inevitably, but necessary.  \n\nEDIT:  I've already responded to a couple of people strawmanning about how the media was mobilized before the rioting after the verdict.  This post is about the first wave of riots that made the issue a sensation in the first place.  \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

None of this is new.  \n\nWhat those riots accomplished was to take a story that everyone was *already* talking about (The news crews were in Ferguson long before that rioting started), and take attention away from the actual issue, and instead direct it toward a bunch of selfish idiots. \n\nThe conversation that we wanted to happen was already happening before the decision ever came down.

It is not emotional to state that white America caused the disaster in Ferguson with racist public policies and indifference to those policies.  It is not at all surprising that this occasionally culminates into episodes of property destruction and violent revolting. You cannot condemn violence from below and declare that \"violence isn't the answer\" (even if in this instance all of the \"violence\" was property destruction) to a problem that has enacted immeasurable suffering upon the black people in the United States. That it is institutionalized and enforced by the state matters little. Your ludicrous conflation of the use of violence by governments and those whom they are oppressing is deliciously indicative of your intellectual bankruptcy.\n\nI also love the cherry picked quite from MLK. Wouldn't it be cool if he only gave the \"I Have a Dream Speech\" and that violence was bad?  It's unfortunate that this complex figure has been hijacked by white America to justify compliance and authoritarianism when that is most assuredly not what he stood for.  \n\n&gt; I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed by the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice, who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice, who constantly says 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action,' who paternalistically believes that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom.\n\n&gt; A riot is the language of the unheard.  \n\nIf you think I'm going to be brow beaten by accusations of racism, then you are sorely mistaken.  There is such thing as the greater good and where it is defined is largely arbitrary.  Claiming otherwise is an errant falsehood.  It was wrong to block traffic and disrupt white businesses in the Civil Rights Era also.  But not as wrong as the racist caste system that was sustained by indifferent whites.  \n\nIt is not genocidal to look at the source of the problem and say moving closer to a resolution that involved peoples's shit getting broken is \"not the answer\" just because it could potentially harm you.  If you want to have a discussion of degrees, that's one thing.  But you're not going to get away with lazily lobbing \"two wrongs don't make a right\" at me and calling me a racist.

Other avenues for political redress such as voting and even peaceful protesting by itself (which are ultimately more effective in the end, but typically only after having a flash point or event to rally around) have been largely compromised by corporate interests and strategic incapacitation policing techniques.

White America and the media are masterful at rationalizing and ignoring systemic racism and police brutality, and while the #blacklivesmatter is obvious propaganda it has kept the discussion of racist policing in the public discourse since it did grow organically after a high profile police shooting.
