You start off with\n&gt;By presuming that people make the best economic decisions when information is evenly distributed, there is an implicit corollary that people not making the best economic decisions have less information.\n\nWhich is my personal biggest beef with economics, and that rationality is somewhat tautologically defined. But you do bring up an important point, which is outside some contrived examples, more information does not hurt. (actually not so contrived as this is the point of any time you are baiting anything)\n\n&gt; So then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. Of course that model has been updated to include the idea that other things besides money can hold utility. Again, the math is harder. When the math is harder, it is less accessible. You have to have better mathematicians to understand it. It's more expensive to work with because you have to hire better mathematicians.\n\nWhich is something I'm personally interested in academically though this is mostly irrelevant to the argument.\n\n&gt; Even worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).\n\nWhich would be an okay conclusion except you forgot about a fundamental idea of economics, which is the feasibility set, which is basically whatever is possible. Your conclusion was basically \"Everybody can be rich if they a) make the best economic choices and b) have the information necessary to do so\". Which leaves out needing to show that for every person there exists a set of decisions which will lead to that person being rich.\n\nWhenever someone is rich, all that that fact alone tells me is that being rich is in that person's feasibility set. For all I know that person could have been a billionaire and wasted all his money gambling and now he is a millionaire. Most of the time this is not true but whenever you think of an heiress or trust fund kid you have to know that pretty much 0 decision making went into whether that person was rich.\n\nOn the other hand, knowing that a person is poor doesn't tell me much, though in most cases being a millionaire was simply not feasible for that person.\n\n&gt; Now of course, you can find ways of mathematically explaining how that's the wrong conclusion to draw, but it is more expensive to do so, and is thus less likely to happen.\n\nYou could make my argument more mathematically rigorous but the way I have presented it used no math, just simple logic.\n\n&gt; Alternative models would just start with different assumptions, and then you could go through the same process of continuously modifying the model until it can explain something like supply and demand.\n\nThe only assumption I actually used was \"everybody has things they can and cannot do\". Which is fairly trivial and is built into most economic models in the form of feasibility sets.\n\nThe issue is when you assume \"all people do the most economically rational thing given the information they have\", which you pointed out. Nothing is actually wrong with this assumption, and if you don't have this economics breaks down. The problem is that we are not actually close to quantifying rationality."}, {"id": "2qy3qo", "body": "This is a much clearer way to say what I was trying to say:\n\nMarket frictions affect poor people more.

In economics, the \"idealized laws\" often bear very little resemblance to reality (perfect labor market?  psht).  And the precise way in which they err almost always ignores the effects on poor people, just like treating the earth as flat will tend to cause you to err on the side of overestimating distances.  Rich people tend to behave much more like the idealized laws, and so when the models get close enough to base policy off of, they tend to err in their favor.\n\nFor instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.  However, this ignores the utility in preserving certain industries nationally, as well as incubation of industries to create a comparative advantage where one didn't exist before.

While not accepted and clearly wrong, it is a valid conclusion to draw from the above assumptions.  So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\n\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I'm saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \n\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \n\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.

So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\n\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven't made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it's because they haven't had enough information (i.e. they haven't educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I'm saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \n\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \n\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.

It's not automatically given and would have to be requested if either parent decides to stop supporting the child. And presumably if the family gets back together, the child support payments would stop. This requires a court system with some discretion, which seems like a challenge (okay, that was a bit snarky, but we can't deny that the courts can be extremely inconsistent), but not unbelievable.\n\nAs an aside, a complete alternative could be to use basic income here. You may be familiar with that (if not, checkout /r/basicincome). It usually covers adults, but could easily cover children, too. The children's pay could be given to the parents until they child becomes an adult and could be appropriately chosen so that it's always enough to raise the child.

Women do not have the option to do this. They cannot sign a paper and have the baby just disappear. They have to go through an invasive medical procedure in order to do it.\n\nWhen you argue that financial abortion is a way of making things \"fair\" to men, you are ignoring the fact that women can't ever have an equivalent option. How is it fair to give men the option to escape any and all responsibilities associated with a pregnancy when we can't give women that same choice?\n\nEdit: I'm getting a lot of responses regarding my comment about \"women cannot sign a paper and have the baby just disappear.\" People are saying that a woman can in fact to this by giving it up for adoption. \n\nYou must realize that giving a baby up for adoption requires carrying and birthing it as well. This is precisely what I meant when I said \"women cannot sign a paper and have the baby just disappear.\" The baby will not disappear if the woman decides to put it up for adoption. It will still be inside of her, and she must carry it to term.

A couple who is \"forced\" to abort because they can't afford it is the same as an individual who is \"forced\" to abort because they can't afford it. Technically they could both have the child regardless, but it'd be irresponsible. You can't say a woman is forced to abort by her partner because he isn't willing to pay child support any more than you can say the couple is forced to abort by the state because it isn't willing to pay child support. When it's solely down to you whether or not you have a child, it's not someone else's responsibility to pay for it. They aren't being told to do something under pain of suffering, they're being told if they're going to make a decision by themselves, they can be responsible for it by themselves.\n\nEdit: That said, I'd be totally behind the male who got a \"financial abortion\" from also being obligated to pay for any \"biological abortion\" that occured as a result."}, {"id": "cnaztau", "body": "The issue is that this allows the man in the relationship the ability to financially coerce the woman into making the choice he wants.

Rather, they claim that the child support is for the best interests of the child, which has the disadvantage of growing up with only one parent (child support isn't supposed to be used for cases where the single parent is obviously capable of supporting the child or when they have a new partner who can support the child, but it seems that this sometimes happens irregardless).\n\nPersonally, I rather disagree with this because the woman always has the ability to remove the financial burden by aborting or giving the child up for adoption (for context, abortions are government funded in my area, as is the cost of giving birth in a hospital. Also, maternity leave is legally required). As a result, I expect the woman to not have a child if they cannot financially support it.\n\nAdmittedly, there is the unbalance of the stress that the woman has as well as the difficulties of carrying a child. However, I see that as far less of an impact compared to the cost and stress of raising a child (besides, abortion is very easy and straightforward during the early stages of pregnancy)."}, {"id": "cnasyhv", "body": "\u2206\n\nI will say that in most cases, rape does not apply, simply that the father never wanted the child.

That's probably part of why there's a discrepancy between the woman being allowed to abort and the man not being able to give up financial responsibility - the woman is aborting something that is still a part of her body, ergo not a socially independent entity, whereas the man is \"aborting\" a new member of society, a real person. That carries many more problems for society, which now has to care for this real person by providing the education, healthcare, housing, etc that its birth father refused it. Conversely, only the biological mother has to care for her foetus (outside of any state abortion funding, which may be in place because it's cheaper to pay for abortions than to pay for unwanted babies). If that is indeed the rationale, then I don't see financial abortion ever becoming a thing. I'm pulling this together from my background knowledge only, but considering that most of developed countries' birth rate comes from the lower classes, where alimony payments would be a strain on the father (add class-specific issues with marriage rates and parental abandonment rates, racial and ethnic specifics), giving fathers the option to give up their children financially would put an unconscionable strain on the state budget.

This really comes down to the fact that I believe nobody should have a child that they cannot afford.

A law that forces otherwise goes against the original intent of the people having sex (I'm presuming that people who have sex do not want a child unless they discuss and agree before hand).\n\nFurther, requiring child support payments could be viewed as damaging to the payee. It's a major expense that can financially cripple those who don't have a lot of extra cash (which is quite a lot of people).

This is because if finances are an issue, the woman always has the power to abort or put the child up for adoption.\n\nAs you can tell, I have very strong views against having children that you're knowingly not financially able to support.

Not because they want a baby, but because it \"feels better\" or whatever and because they can risk it, without having as many consequences. If they don't want it, the women would either have to abort it or live without any financial aid. Easy. \n\nThis has already been mentioned often enough in this thread, but while some women don't have physical or psychological trouble, there are still lots who suffer from it. Not every woman can deal with an abortion, even though she might not have wanted a baby before. If you're unlucky, you might also not be able to have anymore babies or have difficult pregnancies. \n\nAnyhow, in any case, or probably in the better case, this would end in more abortions.

They are artificial consequences, but they are there to keep other people from harming other people's life.\n\n&gt; As I said, financial abortion or the lack thereof would not give women more ability to say no.\n\nNo, but there would be a bigger barrier of guys to have unprotected sex, it's shouldn't be up to the women alone anyway.

Some other people have argued that the situation for women is unfair because they actually have to carry the child and the biology of the situation. That's assuming they waited to have the child. If a woman goes through with an entire pregnancy and doesn't abort her child then SHE made the decision to have that child, not the man. Women know the outcome of sex just as much as men, sometimes they result in babies, why a man has to pay for a child he doesnt want doesnt make sense to me. We havent even discussed the very real situation in many households where the women are currently the breadwinners and make substantially more money than their S.O. Many women abuse this system and try to get pregnant with wealthy men in illegitimate situations to abuse this law. I would have to add though that the one reason i feel the status quo is fair is the fact that we have a lot of fucked up places in america where a poor disenfranchised women wont have adequate access to a safe abortion option, in that case the baby is coming whether you like it or not, and i do feel the guy has to cough up the cash in that sad and unfortunate situation.\n\nCase 3 i feel is even more important. The emotional toll it would have to be in love with a women, hear that she has conceived your child, and then hear immediately that she doesnt feel like shes ready and wants to get rid of it, can be extremely traumatic for a lot of men. There was a story about it on relationships a while ago that just broke my heart. The girl basically told the dude (im paraphrasing) \"you're a great guy, but im not exactly head over heels for you. i just dont feel that way and I'm going to take care of it.\" True, its only a collection of few generic cells, this isnt a pro life pro choice discussion, but that doesnt change the fact that a lot of guys view this as a very personal and damaging situation to be in. One that really haunts them for a long time, especially when it occurs in mature adult relationships later on in life. \n\nJust thought to add my 0.02\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "cnanr7n", "body": "I completely understand where you are coming from, and to be honest, I  sometimes feel the same way you do.

Not every woman will be affected this way, but a lot are and this is a serious consideration for a serious situation. If the man can simply abdicate any responsibility and withdraw financial support, then the woman may feel forced into doing something that could devastate her mental health down the road, or to leave the government supporting the child (for less badly off women, perhaps just for the time she is at home with the child following birth before going back to work). The father - the other party - is then first in line along with her to provide for that child. He doesn't have to be around. He doesn't have to be involved in that child's life, but while he can afford to pay child support he will be paying essentially an extra tax (for the child).

That is never applied to men! People are perfectly comfortable with forcing men to be parents even if *they* don't want to be, or cannot afford to provide for a child. At its heart, arguments in favour of abortion are never really about what's in the best interests of anyone except the mother, and I take issue with that, because the child and the father both matter too.

It's called abortion, and opting out of parenthood is the reason why most women have abortions (obviously this does NOT include people who abort because the mother's health is in jeopardy or the baby is terminally ill and they want to spare it from suffering). Abortion ensures that you won't have to continue to be pregnant, and it ensures that you will never have to take responsibility for the child in any way after birth. It accomplishes exactly the same thing that is accomplished in a man's life when he walks away from a woman who is carrying his child...it is exactly no different (well, a little bit different, because he doesn't have to abort the child in order to reject parenthood).

I also understand the underlying arguments for a man being on the hook for child support. However, I believe that these arguments clash against each other, and I feel that men should either be able to waive their financial obligations to their child, or they should partake in the decision for the woman to get an abortion.\n\n\"Women should be the decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion because they should have control of their own bodies\"\n\nThis is a perfectly valid point. In this argument, the fetus is being treated as a part of the woman's body and therefore, the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the well-being of the fetus and its future.\n\n\"Men should be on the hook for child support because we shouldn't be focused on the parents, but rather the well-being of the child\"\n\nThis also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing, the needs of the parents shouldn't be placed before the needs of the child.\n\nHowever, if we take the argument that \"women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus\", then it should also be right to say that \"men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus\".\n\nIf we take the argument that \"the well-being of the child should come before the well-being of the parents\", then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the well-being of the child's future.\n\nI find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body, but when it comes to men, their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man.\n\nTherefore, I believe that men should either have abortion rights, or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child (while abortion is still an option).\n\nNote: I'm not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing.

Maybe this is something that women of fertile age inherently know but I never considered that men don't realize. In fact, this too would explain why my boyfriend couldn't understand why I would insist on waiting until the start of my second trimester of pregnancy to tell people should I ever become pregnant. He didn't see why we couldn't just tell people right away... he didn't have the fear of miscarriage lingering over him like me and many other women do.\n\n&gt;About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, and more than 80 percent of these losses happen before 12 weeks. ([link](http://www.babycenter.com/0_understanding-miscarriage_252.bc))\n\n10 to 20% of pregnancies miscarry almost immediately. There are 102 pregnancies per 1,000 women annually in the U.S. ([link](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db136.htm)) That means for every 100 pregnant women in the U.S., about 15 (average between 10-20) will lose their pregnancy. Out of every 1,000 women in the U.S., 15 of them recently suffered what is usually a massive loss and severe emotional trauma. \n\nPregnancy is a scary time. If you actually want the child and aren't aborting, you still don't guarantee you get it. The entire 9 months is walking on egg shells hoping your body doesn't spontaneously abort your child for no reason. It happens 10-20% of the time; this isn't paranoia, it's a justified fear. Probably most people in the U.S. know someone who suffered a miscarriage. Both of my grandmothers did and I just learned one of my aunts did as well. Two of my friends my age have. Pregnancy is a scary risky time! Every time a pregnant friend or family member of mine finally gives birth, I breath such a sigh of relief. \n\nMy point is that with this view of mine and many other's of pregnancy *not* being a guarantee of a child in any way whatsoever, the idea of stopping the pregnancy on purpose becomes much less of a big deal, and the idea of a fetus in the womb is 100% separate from the idea of a baby. The baby made it; the fetus is still at huge risk. They are not the same whatsoever, they're in significantly different situations, and while if you're wanting to keep the baby it will be very painful to lose a fetus during pregnancy, it still isn't the same situation as losing a born child.

She can decide to eat soft cheese or raw eggs and fish, drink alcohol, take drugs, go to the doctor (or not), give birth by C-section or vaginally or in a tub, with or without painkillers, an epidural, or other medical interventions. \n\nIn addition, the fetus is a very real medical situation for the woman. She has to quit taking medications (and common drugs like antidepressants, anticonvulsants, mood stabilizers, asthma treatment, and some antibiotics are problematic), deal with sharing her blood supply, increased stroke, mood issues, nausea/vomiting (which can get BAD, to the point of requiring IV fluids and feeding tubes), and a whole host of other medical conditions. From a strictly medical standpoint, it makes sense to allow abortion, because pregnancy can have SERIOUS consequences (career, personal life, mental and physical health). It has nothing to do with the father's rights or the woman's desire to raise a baby, and everything to do with whether or not she is able to (or wants to) make the adjustments necessary to grow a new human. For the record, she may or may not know that some of these things are going to be an issue until after she's pregnant - Hyperemesis gravidarum, for instance, can be bad enough to make you decide you'd rather not starve to death because you're pregnant. \n\nOnce the child is born, it's a different story. If both parents consent to give the child up (via safe haven laws) then they can both have a financial abortion as you're advocating. Otherwise, though, both parents are legally responsible for financial support. The bias in the legal system right now is real, but the way to fight that is to fight the bias in the implementation, not to fight for \"financial abortions\" - the societal problems with that sort of policy are significant enough that we'd have to simultaneously reform the entire safety net to provide these children with a guaranteed income paid for by the state, which would need to be funded through taxes.
