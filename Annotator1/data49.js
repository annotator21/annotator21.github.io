The public is by and large not angry at de Blasio. Maybe the NYPD would be happy if he was kicked out, but that does nothing to fix the NYPD's image problem.

Obviously I am as upset about Saturday's shootings (when two NYPD officers were killed) as everyone so don't think I'm trying to minimize that.\n\nHowever, bigger issues should not allow these officers to get away unpunished. If you don't know what I'm referring to, when New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the hospital where the two officers died, several other officers who were present turned their backs on him in a deliberate show of disrespect. De Blasio is currently facing major criticism from the NYPD unions and even had to have a press conference today where the police commissioner defended him to try and calm things down.\n\nThe officers who publicly and intentionally disrespected the Mayor ought to lose their jobs. If I publicly disrespected my boss, you'd better believe I would get the axe.\n\nPolice officers are charged with a public duty to keep the peace and obey the policies set forth by their superiors. If they don't like it they're free to complain in private just like anyone, but to use their public profiles to make a point is unacceptable. Worse, New York is clearly in need of unity right now and creating further division is a serious safety hazard. These officers aren't just failing in their jobs, they're actively causing damage.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that they thought this was okay to do. They definitely knew what they were doing, so it would be silly to claim they didn't realize it would make the news. They're blaming de Blasio for senseless murders committed by a man who was obviously insane - on the same day, he shot his girlfriend and then committed suicide. The fact that (like most of America) he criticized the NYPD on Twitter is irrelevant, and even if it did matter that has nothing to do with the Mayor.\n\nRegardless of whether its fair or not, the NYPD currently needs to fix its public image in the interest of public safety. Police officers are supposed to be respectable figures who put the public's needs above their own. These officers clearly violated that mission and are trying to stir up trouble, so they should lose their jobs immediately.\n\nCMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Off the top of my head, two of them were actively shooting at the police, and one had a knife and was stabbing people in a synagogue. Garner's death was a tragic accient.

Obviously I am as upset about Saturday's shootings (when two NYPD officers were killed) as everyone so don't think I'm trying to minimize that.\n\nHowever, bigger issues should not allow these officers to get away unpunished. If you don't know what I'm referring to, when New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the hospital where the two officers died, several other officers who were present turned their backs on him in a deliberate show of disrespect. De Blasio is currently facing major criticism from the NYPD unions and even had to have a press conference today where the police commissioner defended him to try and calm things down.\n\nThe officers who publicly and intentionally disrespected the Mayor ought to lose their jobs. If I publicly disrespected my boss, you'd better believe I would get the axe.\n\nPolice officers are charged with a public duty to keep the peace and obey the policies set forth by their superiors. If they don't like it they're free to complain in private just like anyone, but to use their public profiles to make a point is unacceptable. Worse, New York is clearly in need of unity right now and creating further division is a serious safety hazard. These officers aren't just failing in their jobs, they're actively causing damage.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that they thought this was okay to do. They definitely knew what they were doing, so it would be silly to claim they didn't realize it would make the news. They're blaming de Blasio for senseless murders committed by a man who was obviously insane - on the same day, he shot his girlfriend and then committed suicide. The fact that (like most of America) he criticized the NYPD on Twitter is irrelevant, and even if it did matter that has nothing to do with the Mayor.\n\nRegardless of whether its fair or not, the NYPD currently needs to fix its public image in the interest of public safety. Police officers are supposed to be respectable figures who put the public's needs above their own. These officers clearly violated that mission and are trying to stir up trouble, so they should lose their jobs immediately.\n\nCMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'll never understand why people think that an act has to be entirely selfless for it to have any semblance of selflessness or value. \n\nLet me put it another way. Sure, a large motivating factor in why someone talks another person off a ledge is because they either want to feel good about themselves or because they don't want to feel bad about themselves. But they don't feel good or bad in a vaccuum. They feel good or bad for a reason.  \n\nWhat it means to care about the life and death of another person is to feel those emotions. Without those emotions, I don't know what care means.  The persons conscience will only eat at them later because they will be thinking about how they could have prevented the loss of something valuable to them.  Sure, if it's a stranger, the value will be more abstract in their minds, but it is easy to look at one human you don't know and imagine if it was someone you did. It's easy to imagine their loved ones crying or the loss  of future happiness for the individual because you yourself have loved ones and hope for future happiness. Those visions make the average human feel negative emotions. \n\nThe only time I agree with you is when someone does something like this simply out of fear of hell, or fear of looking bad in front of others. I don't think those are the majority of cases however and would argue that they only truly occur in cases where a person has a deficiency of empathy. \n\nYou could also maybe argue that part of the motivation is to simply not look bad to yourself and take a hit to your ego (is that your point?). But even in that situation, you have to value doing good and you have to value it for a reason for this to effect your ego in the first place. It makes little sense to me to rank which motivaion is higher on things like this since they all necessarily need to be present and wok together. Emotion and caring about something are borderline synonymous in my opinion. If it was hypothetically possible to care about something without emotion, I don't think that would elevate the moral deed, I think that would cheapen it.  I also don't know what it would mean.

At that point, it's up to whether Luke's speed+precog, mind control, or telekinesis can target and hit the Flash. If Flash can evade until Luke tires out, he'll win. If he can't, he gets crushed by various force powers.\n\nHere's [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/1m0rt1/luke_skywalker/) [2](http://www.narutoforums.com/showthread.php?t=532457) respect threads for luke, and a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1xqte5/luke_skywalker_eu_peak_bloodlusted_vs_the_flash/) to the luke v flash fight on WWW."}, {"id": "cn3wwyg", "body": "It seems like everyone in the luke vs flash fight would go to flash if you don't give prep to Luke.

And nothing moves faster than light.\n\nSo let's slow down the Flash by about 12x and put him at say 0.9c.\n\nRandall Munroe has [a really good explainer](https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/) on what happens if you suddenly have something going 0.9c in Earth's atmosphere.  Short version, the immense velocity causes the matter in the air and the matter in Flash's fist to have a fusion reaction, and resultant nuclear-bomb style explosion.  He kills the other superhero, and everyone in a mile radius.  I guess that's \"beating\" the superhero, but seems like a phyrric victory.\n\nSo let's slow down again, and talk about the more normal factors of air resistance.  Drag is partially linear in resistance to motion, and partly exponential.  I am not a fluid dynamics expert, but let's go to some examples of things moving fast in the atmosphere, and how much drag and heat they generate.  As far as I know, Flash isn't immune to heat, and would get burned at some point.  Realistically, at sea level, let's say he can hit mach 3, which is roughly 1000 m/s.  And we'll ignore the sonic booms blowing out everyone's ear drums.\n\nSo Flash can get off like 4 thousand punches in a second, assuming just 1/4 meter transit for both pullback and strike.   That's not inconsequential, and would quite easily kill a normal person.  But a lot of superheroes could withstand it for long enough to react."}, {"id": "cn3a1hl", "body": "Writers of The Flash look at all that relativity stuff and say, \"LOL, Speedforce!\"\n\nLike this- Physics is like, \"Hey Wally, slow down or you'll release so much kinetic energy you'll blow the atmosphere right off the planet!\" \n\nThen Speedforce tells physics to toss it's salad and then zips off, giggling madly.

Then you have to think about Mass x speed So even with his wimpy arms he is hitting you with unfathomable force.
