It is entirely possible to have either one without the other, so your point is moot from the start.\n\nAs per your definition, a patriarchy is a system in which men hold the majority of direct political or social power, but whether or not that actually creates any gender roles at all is not an inherent consequence of the definition, and as such it's completely disingenuous to claim the two phenomena are related. The whole things absolutely *reeks* of trying to blame the entire phenomenon of gender roles on men by way of tenuously connecting their positions in power to the status quo regarding gender roles, which is entirely false as we all know, since men are most definitely not the only ones perpetuating any gender stereotypes, and they are most certainly not handed down from above.\n\nIt's a complete non sequitur, the two unrelated phenomena of gender roles *et al* being connected to which gender has direct political power. Either you define patriarchy as mere gender roles which cast men as being leaders, in which case it's an alarmist misnomer that has nothing to do with men specifically, or you say it's a *de facto* system of political and governmental organization (which is what the term means, by the way, and which you - more or less - have used), in which case gender roles are an unrelated phenomenon.\n\nIn short, if you're using patriarchy as the term is and ought to be understood, as a system where men hold the majority of direct political power, then it is in and of itself a non-issue, as made clear previously. If, on the other hand, you are using it as a by-word for gender roles which cast men as aggressive, ambitious leaders, you are using it in a despicable attempt to shift blame onto a gender by insinuating that their political positions somehow grant them power to determine gender roles unilaterally.\n\n&gt;While legally the system no longer discriminates\n\nWomen receive shorter sentences for the same crimes...\n\n&gt;And men can represent women just fine, it's just more likely that a woman will understand women's issues better because she is a woman. A man has certain privileges that he might not acknowledge, and so may not even know what kind of work needs to be done to help the situation whereas a woman has likely experienced these problems.\n\nThere are two problems with this logic. First, gender is at best a tertiary or quaternary factor in terms of representation: a poor man has more in common with a poor woman than a rich woman does, and the same applies to race and probably religion as well. The entire idea flies in the face of feminist \"Men and women are identical!\" rhetoric as well. Second, if this is so, why bother with the opinions of men at all? What you're telling me, in so many words, is that I ought never to vote for a woman because she can't relate to my issues as well as a man.\n\nOf course the elephant in the room is that women inherently seem to relate better to men than women relate to women (because, contrary to what would be convenient, humans are sexually dimorphic), which means even if all other things are equal more women will vote for men than men will vote for women and the \"issue\" of \"unequal representation\" - if your idea of equality is an identity quota - continues on unchanged.

If you ask any of these people why they accept low wages (or zero wages in the case of parents), the most common replies are variations on a theme: that of influence over children. \n\nDo you understand what this implies, or do I need to explain further? And don't bother replying if you're not going to answer my question.

My comment in this thread does not address that question; I'm not building on or clarifying it right now, I'm introducing a new line of argument:\n\nPatriarchy as a cultural system describes a wide variety of phenomena, that influence every aspect of civilization. No or almost no institutions exist **solely** as a manifestation of patriarchy, but **all** institutions are influenced in their form and function by patriarchy.\n\nOne of the mechanisms of patriarchy is gendered enculturation: There are, according to the narrative, two kinds of people: Men, and Women. \n\nEveryone learns the rules for what it's like to be a man, and what it's like to be a woman.\n\nThese rules are a goldmine of sexism, misogyny, and patriarchy. (There's also a lot else in there: Homophobia, religious intolerance, racism, etc.)\n\nThis message is blasted at all of us, from every angle of the world, all our lives. **The best we can possibly do** is equip children to notice the fact that these messages exist, and that they aren't automatically good or right or valid.\n\nBut everyone -- every member of society, from misogynistic men to feminist women to nonbinary people and so on and so on -- everyone has misogyny cooked into their worldview.\n\nPeople manage different degrees of dismantling these beliefs. Part of being a feminist is learning the things you automatically believe and dismantling them.\n\nBut nobody ever gets rid of all of it.\n\nThere is no purity -- there is no achievement of true separation from patriarchy or misogyny.

It implies the institutions of male domination and entails female subordination. Many patriarchal societies are also patrilineal, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage. In the familial sense, the female equivalent is matriarchy.\n\nSo to go by them one by one:\n\n&gt;Political leadership\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;Moral Authority\n\nI can't see it being either way.\n\n&gt;Social privilege\n\nyes.\n\n&gt;control of property\n\nNo. (In fact here in the UK the biggest private landowner is a woman - the Queen)\n\n&gt;Fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children\n\nAbsolutely not. In fact I'd say the current legal system in the UK gives more power to women in many circumstances such as during divorce proceedings, child custody etc. In fact [the law here states](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/scotland/relationships_s/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_s/birth_certificates_scotland.htm#h_who_can_register_a_birth) that if a couple are unmarried then it is ENTIRELY at the woman's discretion to put the father on the birth certificate or not and thus it is ENTIRELY within her power to deny an unmarried man any access or rights to his own child.\n\n&gt;Institutions of male domination and entails female subordination\n\nSome are some aren't.

In these cases are the systems matriarchal?\n\n&gt;Many patriarchal societies are also patrilineal, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.\n\nAbsolutely not the case.\n\nSo there are elements of patriarchy here, but in other cases it is not the case or are in fact the other way.

If more men are in office, then it's because women put them there! \n\nThis is just one small example that sheds light on why patriarchy is nothing more than a ~~theory~~ hypothesis. It's not proven and the examples often cited are easily dismissed. I think that is why so many feminists resort to shaming, silencing, and censorship tactics when their ideas are challenged. More often than not they can't argue their points logically and they don't stand up to scrutiny, so they shut down discourse so not to look bad. Look up the research that found leftists and SJW types are much more likely to unfriend people on facebook when getting into arguments about this stuff. It's a clear example of what I'm talking about (shutting down discourse because their beliefs don't stand up to scrutiny).

It's too masculine of an activity for me.  That doesn't offend me because it's just how I was born.  There are some things you simply couldn't do if you tried.  Some of these things suit men and some things suit women.  Exceptions do not contradict the general principle.  Everyone agrees that men couldn't carry a baby even if they tried because there are no exceptions.  Even though most men are bigger and stronger than most women, for some reason people get offended when people say \"men are better at sports than women\".  It's just true.  That makes most sports a masculine activity.\n\nNow, these differences cause us to do other things.  If I'm a better worker than my wife, then I'm going to spend most of my time working.  That means she spends her time doing the other jobs that need to get done.  Those are feminine things.

Feminists often try to silence women's criticisms of feminism by saying they have internalized misogyny. I don't believe this is the case. A lack of belief in the patriarchy can be caused by the lack of empirical evidence. Examples of misogyny and discrimination don't have to be ignored or excused (as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do) because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy, nor institutional misogyny. Saying a woman has internalized misogyny discredits her experience of what may be a lack of being victimized. Telling a woman she's a victim when she's not is belittling. This is what draws many women away from feminism."}, {"id": "cnbyscc", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cnbyscc", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"id": "cncc75e", "body": "Removed, see comment rule 1"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "2r1omi", "body": "My logic basically stems from the idea of \"If you can't afford to have child, you can't have a child.\" Let me explain.\n\nIn my opinion, if one parent wants to keep the child and the other doesn't, then unless they can be proven unfit for parenting -this includes financial instability- then good for them, go for it. The only time I could see child support being necessary is if they parent needs the extra money to support their child(ren). But I'm sorry, you can't have a child if you can't support it and you sure as hell can't take the money from someone else regardless of their involvement in the child's creation. \n\nObviously it's a different story if they are splitting custody, then an arrangement should be made about how the money should be split.\n\nIf only the mother wants the child then she can have it and raise it by herself or with whomever she wants.\n\nIf only the father wants the child then it's up to the mother if she wants to have it and the forfeit custody to him after birth. If she does then it's the father's responsibility alone. No strings attached.\n\nI realize that it's to stop guys from knocking up women and then running off and leaving her to raise it but she can just get an abortion if she can't raise it. Or put it up for adoption/ find a willing guardian (ex.: friend, parent etc.) if she doesn't want to do that. Not to mention the fact that both of them should have taken precautions to avoid pregnancy beforehand, though I admit nothing's fool proof.\n\nAnyway, I haven't been thinking about this very long so I could be completely missing something so CMV.\n\nEdit: Whoa this is controversial. Thanks everyone for commenting.\nA few people pointed out that if the parents are already together and one tries to walk out they should still have to pay. Yes, I agree because there was an understanding that both would provide for the kid. I'm talking about right after the pregnancy or even right after birth. If one person wants to keep it and the other doesn't, that's their decision and they need to pay for it.\n\nEdit: 2\n\nMkay. View changed thnx guis. &amp;#8710;. No but I guess it makes sense to hold both parties accountable if they understood the risks in the first place, which everybody does. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea, but they sort of agreed to the risks when they consented.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
